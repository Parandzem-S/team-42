    "transcript": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. I'm Natalie, your Chorus Call operator. Welcome, and thank you for joining the Deutsche Bank Q1 2023 Analyst Conference Call. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to for closing -- sorry, Deputy Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 results call. As usual, our Chief Executive Officer, Christian Sewing, will speak first; followed by our Chief Financial Officer, James von Moltke. The presentation, as always, is available to download in the Investor Relations section of our website, db.com. Before we get started, let me just remind you that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which may not develop as we currently expect. We, therefore, ask you to take notice of the precautionary warning at the end of our materials.  With that, let me hand over to Christian.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, , and welcome from me, too. It's a pleasure to discuss our first quarter 2023 results with you today, and we are pleased with the progress we continue to make towards our 2025 goals. The first quarter was marked by turbulent conditions in the banking sector, particularly in March in addition to the macroeconomic challenges. However, our transformation has provided us with strong foundations, which enabled us to navigate these challenges successfully.  We delivered on four critical --. First, profitability. Pretax profits increased by 12% to EUR 1.9 billion and post-tax profit by 8% to EUR 1.3 billion which on both counts, represents our strongest quarter since 2013. Our cost-to-income ratio was 71% this quarter, 2 percentage points better than the prior year, driven by positive operating leverage. We also generated an 8.3% post-tax return on tangible equity in this period.  As you know, annual bank levies are recognized in the first quarter. Spreading these bank levies equally across the four quarters of the year, our first quarter cost income ratio would be 67% with a post-tax return on tangible equity of 10%, putting us well on track to our 2025 targets.  Second, we proved the strength of our franchise. Our business model is focused on four client-centric businesses, which complement each other and provide a well diversified earnings mix as this quarter shows. We delivered revenues of EUR 7.7 billion, up 5% over the prior year quarter.  Third, we again proved our resilience. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 30.6%, up from 13.4% in the previous quarter and 12.8% in the first quarter of last year. Our liquidity reserves were EUR 241 billion, and our liquidity coverage ratio rose to 143%.  Finally, sustainability is an important part of our strategy. As you heard at our sustainability deep dive in March, we have updated our business strategies and policies, expanded on our commitments in several ways to fight climate change, namely our thermal coal policy and our ambition is to encourage our corporate clients to commit to net zero. This quarter, we made further progress towards our target of EUR 500 billion of sustainable financing and investments, excluding DWS by end 2025. Our cumulative volume since January 2020 has grown to EUR 238 billion.  Let me now turn to Slide 2 to discuss the strong performance across our divisions this quarter. We saw good momentum across all business and delivered on the strategic steps, which support our 2025 targets and strengthen our global house bank model.  The Corporate Bank showed financial strength with record revenues and good client activity across our main businesses. I'm pleased that we are winning mandates with top clients to support working capital and their global value chain.  In the Investment Bank, we added talent to support growth, and we are expanding our core franchise. We increased our global market share by more than 40 basis points compared to the previous quarters in Origination & Advisory and achieved year-on-year revenue growth in rates for the fifth consecutive quarter. This reflects our ongoing investments, especially in capital-light business areas.  The Private Bank produced its best ever operating revenues, grew assets under management and captured net inflows. We also successfully completed the next wave of the Postbank IT migration at the beginning of April, transferring over 6.5 million contracts from 5 million Postbank clients. This will unlock the EUR 300 million of cost efficiencies as we previously communicated.  Asset Management saw inflows of EUR 6 billion and EUR 9 billion, excluding cash, despite turbulent markets. Stefan Hoops is progressing with the strategy by investing into transformation to create a stand-alone platform while expanding the product offering. launched the largest ETF of all time in the U.S. of approximately USD 2 billion. This is also the single largest climate investing ETF launch.  Turning now to the big provision profit on Slide 3. Preprovision profit for the group was EUR 2.2 billion in the first quarter, up 14% compared to the prior year period. We again achieved positive operating leverage as we grew our revenues and controlled expenses. This quarter underlines how complementary our businesses are and how our strategic transformation has helped us to rebalance our income strength.  I'm particularly pleased with the performance at the Corporate Bank and Private Bank, which benefited from the normalized rate environment. The contribution from the Corporate Bank and the Private Bank to preprovision profit increased to almost 60% from 33% compared with last year. The Investment Bank also produced a solid underlying contribution against an exceptionally strong prior year quarter.  The rebalancing towards our stable revenue businesses is especially visible when looking at their contribution to the total group's preprovision profit on a last 12 months basis. The Corporate Bank and Private Bank alone have contributed 70% over this period. You will recall that our corporate and other results were negatively impacted by valuation timing in the prior year quarter. We anticipated that this would reverse over time, and we are benefiting from this effect this quarter.  The momentum and balance we see across our four businesses gives us confidence we have the right business model and a strong platform to further improve returns.  In addition to our growth focus, we maintained our discipline on cost as we continue to invest in technology and controls and face inflationary pressures. In February, we said that we were working on additional efficiency measures, which we are now implementing and which are shown on Slide 4. The changes we announced to the Management Board yesterday should support this agenda. The creation of a group Chief Operating Officer will help us to deliver our strategic transformation agenda and drive inefficiencies out of the bank.  We also focus on rightsizing our nonclient-facing functions. During the second quarter, we will begin to reduce our senior nonclient-facing workforce by 5% and we'll limit new hiring without compromising our controls.  We continue to align our German Private Bank to the current trends and market environment, including actions to streamline our mortgage platform. In addition, we are working on a series of productivity measures including sophisticated capacity planning in several areas, including anti-financial crime. Our target is to increase returns over time, and we continue to look for more opportunities to deliver on this. I will speak about this later.  Let me now turn to our balance sheet strength and resilient funding profile on Slide 5. Once again, we benefited from disciplined risk management in our strong and stable balance sheet. Our loan book is well diversified across businesses and regions. Around 70% of the book is secured or hedged and almost 80% of our loan portfolio is in stable and mostly lower-risk businesses in the Private Bank and Corporate Bank. Nearly half of our book is based in Germany, and 40% is equally distributed across EMEA and North America with the remainder in APAC.  Our deposit base funds about 60% of the net balance sheet and our loan-to-deposit ratio was 82% at quarter end. Over 80% of our deposits are from most stable client segments such as retail, corporate small- and medium-sized enterprises or severance where we have long-standing and deep-rooted client relationships. 77% of our German retail deposits are insured by the statutory protection scheme. In the Corporate Bank, close to 3/4 of all deposits are sticky operational and term deposits supporting our clients' daily needs. James will say more on deposits later.  Our CET1 ratio strengthened to 13.6%, 250 basis points above the MDA buffer and our highest level for 2 years. Our leverage ratio was 4.6%.  As I said, our liquidity metrics remained sound. The LCR was 143%, above our target of around 130% with a buffer of EUR 63 billion above regulatory required levels. The net stable funding ratio was 120% at the high end of the group's target range of 115% to 120% and EUR 100 billion above required levels.  To summarize, we have solid foundations to navigate through the recent turbulent environment. And importantly, I view the European banking sector as stable, thanks in part to the regulatory efforts of recent years.  Moving to Slide 6. The current environment underlines the importance of our global house bank model, which positions us well to serve clients in volatile markets. When we set out our strategy in March last year, we outlined the key themes which underpin these goals and ambitions. And these themes have become even more important in light of the geopolitical and macroeconomic upheavals since then.  Our first quarter results demonstrate the progress we are making on the path towards our 2025 goals, benefiting from a strategy and business model, which are well aligned to market trends. We will leverage the more favorable interest rate environment, deploy our risk management expertise to support clients and -- capital to high-return growth opportunities.  With sustainability being so important, we will deepen our dialogue with and support for clients, expand our product range and broaden our agenda for our own operations. We will also continue to benefit from the investments we are making in technology together with our strategic partners. The investments should accelerate our transition to a digital bank and the benefits should be seen our efficiency and controls. These technology investments are also designed to create value for our clients.  We believe we have the right strategy and the right focus on clients, which allow us to accelerate execution of our strategy, enhance our franchise and drive returns. We see these opportunities on three dimensions, which we detail on Slide 7. We have committed to self-fund our investments and increase operating leverage through efficiencies and we now see additional scope to do that. We already indicated that we aim to deliver incremental operational efficiencies greater than the EUR 2 billion identified at the 2022 Investor Deep Dive.  As discussed, we are in the process of identifying and executing on a further EUR 500 million of benefits, which we will work to extract. The incremental benefits will come from a strategic review of our entire workforce, further optimizing the distribution networks in the Private Bank. We also expect to see benefits in operations and process automation, and we are excited about the opportunities that should emerge from artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Second, we are focusing on capital efficiency. Deploying capital to increase shareholder value has always been our priority, and we see opportunities to reallocate capital. We aim to free up EUR 15 billion to EUR 20 billion of risk-weighted assets from reduction in certain sub hurdle lending and mortgage portfolios, greater utilization of securitization and hedging optimization. These actions are expected to have a minimal impact on revenues but will enable us to increase returns and reallocate resources to more capital-accretive businesses.  We believe that the combination of cost and capital efficiency, together with additional opportunities across markets should position us to outperform our existing growth objectives. To support this, we continue to invest into our platforms and to take opportunities created by current market conditions to attract talent to strengthen advisory capabilities in various business and regions including Asia. We expect these actions to accelerate the execution of our strategy and more importantly, increase returns to shareholders over time.  Before I hand over to James, let me summarize our progress on Slide 8. Our performance in the first quarter demonstrates the strength of Deutsche Bank's franchise, earnings power and balance sheet. Our transformation has given us a strong platform for growth with a diverse business model, providing well-balanced earnings. This provides a strong step-up to accelerate our global house bank ambition through additional actions on the three dimensions we just discussed.  We remain fully committed to our capital distribution plan. With the successful first quarter behind us and strong capital, we have now initiated the dialogue with the supervisors about share buybacks, which are expected to take place in the second half of this year. This is in line with the promise we made last quarter that we initiate the step once we have greater clarity on a number of issues, including the macro environment.  Everything we have seen this quarter supports our view that we are on the right path. The group is well positioned to capitalize on current trends to drive returns above the cost of equity.  With that, let me hand over to James.\nJames von Moltke: Thank you, Christian. Let me start with a few key performance indicators in the first quarter on Slide 10 and put them in the context of our 2025 targets. We have strong revenue momentum. A balanced business mix enables us to benefit from higher interest rates despite challenging financial markets, delivering revenue growth above our 2025 targeted compound annual growth rate on a last 12-month basis. Our post-tax return on tangible equity was 8.3% in the first quarter or 10% prorating bank levies through the year, already in line with our 2025 target. We've made steady progress on our cost income ratio, which was 71% in the quarter, a 4 percentage point improvement on full year 2022.  If the bank levies were prorated across the year, the cost/income ratio would be 67%. The first quarter performance shows clear progress toward our 2025 target of less than 62.5%. And we demonstrated the strength of our capital and balance sheet and the quality of our loan book in challenging conditions. Our capital ratio was 13.6% in the first quarter in line with our 2025 target of around 13%.  With that, let me turn to the first quarter highlights on Slide 11. Group revenues were EUR 7.7 billion, up 5% on the first quarter of 2022 and with a better balance across our businesses. Noninterest expenses were EUR 5.5 billion and adjusted costs of EUR 5.4 billion were essentially flat year-on-year. We booked bank levies of EUR 473 million this quarter, down 35% year-on-year as a result of a reduction in the sector-wide single resolution fund assessment as well as our improved relative sector contribution and an increased use of the revocable commitments. Our provision for credit losses was EUR 372 million or 30 basis points of average loans. Overall, credit losses remained well contained despite a small number of idiosyncratic events.  We generated a profit before tax of EUR 1.9 billion, up 12% and net profit of EUR 1.3 billion, up 8% compared to the prior year quarter. Our cost-income ratio came in at 71%, down 2 percentage points versus the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share was EUR 0.61 in the first quarter with an effective tax rate of 29%. Tangible book value per share was EUR 27.28, up 2% on the fourth quarter of 2022 and up 8% year-on-year.  Now let me turn to some of the drivers of these results, starting with our NIM development on Slide 12. We have continued to benefit from the interest rate environment in the first quarter, as demonstrated by the rise in net interest margin in the Corporate Bank and Private Bank. Group NIM, however, declined due to the accounting treatment of some of our central hedges and balance sheet management activities. This quarter, the accounting effect resulted in a sequential impact on group NIM of around negative 20 basis points. This effect is held in C&O, where it is fully offset by an increase in noninterest revenue, and there is no economic loss to the firm or overall impact on group P&L.  Realized deposit betas remained favorable when compared to our models, but we expect this to partially normalize in the coming quarters as the pace of interest rate rises slow. Average interest-earning assets declined modestly, driven mainly by our TLTRO payments.  With that, let's turn to costs on Slide 13. Adjusted costs, excluding bank levies of EUR 4.9 billion were flat sequentially, but increased by 5% year-on-year or EUR 240 million. This reflected cumulative investments over the past 12 months in technology, controls and people, together with higher business activity and inflationary pressures. The monthly average run rate of around EUR 1.63 billion is in line with our prior guidance, and we expect to operate at the run rate of between EUR 1.6 billion and EUR 1.65 billion per month for the rest of the year.  Looking at the individual components. Compensation and benefits costs were essentially flat as increased fixed remuneration was offset by lower variable remuneration. Ongoing workforce optimization limited the impact of higher headcount. IT costs were up EUR 66 million or 8% year-on-year, reflecting continued investments in technology and innovation. Professional services increased by EUR 25 million, driven by business consulting and legal fees. And the increase of around EUR 100 million in other costs mainly reflects increasing expenses for banking services and outsourced operations. We also saw a normalization of travel and marketing expenses.  Let's now turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 14. Provision for credit losses for the first quarter was 30 basis points of average loans or EUR 372 million. Stage 3 provisions increased to EUR 397 million compared to EUR 114 million in the prior year quarter. The majority of this increase was driven by the Private Bank and included a small number of idiosyncratic events in the International Private Bank. This was partly offset by a release of EUR 26 million in Stages 1 and 2 provisions, partially driven by a slight improvement in the macroeconomic outlook since the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to a charge of EUR 178 million in the prior year quarter. We did not see a wider deterioration in the portfolio outside of this small number of specific events, and overall credit quality remains high. For the full year 2023, we reaffirm our previous guidance range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans.  Let me also cover our commercial real estate portfolio on Slide 15. Our EUR 33 billion commercial real estate focused portfolio represents 7% of our loan book. And as you know, it consists of nonrecourse lending within the core CRE business units in the Investment Bank and the Corporate Bank. As a reminder, we have provided disclosure on this focused portfolio since the COVID crisis.  The portfolio is well diversified across regions and property types. Despite the headwinds facing the sector, we are comfortable with our exposure for several reasons. First, our loan originations are focused on larger institutional quality assets in more liquid primary markets and with strong institutional sponsorship.  Second, the moderate weighted average LTVs, or loan-to-value, of 62% in the Investment Bank and 53% in the Corporate Bank provide material cushion against the expected decline of collateral values. Our sponsors typically have significant skin in the game in the form of cash equity invested in their properties and have invested more equity where needed to ensure the ongoing performance of their assets. However, we recognize the market is under pressure, especially in the U.S. where lending markets have tightened with further uncertainty caused by recent turmoil in the regional banking sector. The U.S. office sector is also facing greater pressure as the office vacancy rate is approaching 20% compared to approximately 7% in Europe.  Our exposure in the U.S. office sector is manageable at EUR 4.5 billion, less than 1% of our total book. Our office portfolio is high quality with around 80% in Class A properties and we have institutional sponsorship in major markets. The loans are primarily backed by multi-tenant properties in large urban markets and again, with high-quality sponsors. The portfolio has an average LTV of around 64% with a weighted average lease term of 6.7 years, which provides relative stability of cash flows. At the same time, only approximately EUR 600 million of exposure has final maturities over the course of the year, which limits the refinancing risk in a higher rate environment.  In the first quarter, provisions related to U.S. office were EUR 60 million or just 4% of the first quarter Stage 3 provisions, which shows the relative resiliency and quality of this book.  Moving to funding and liquidity on Slide 16. We ended the quarter with a liquidity coverage ratio of 143% equivalent to an excess of EUR 63 billion above our regulatory requirements. Over time, as market conditions improve, we would look to prudently steer our LCR down towards our 130% target.  As Christian outlined, we have a well-diversified deposit base across client segments and regions. Our deposit base of EUR 592 billion declined by 5% sequentially or 4% on an FX-adjusted basis, year-on-year. The decline in part reflected a normalization from the elevated levels seen in the second half of last year and was broadly in line with the market. About 1/3 of the reduction in balances came at the end of the quarter as certain clients reposition parts of their exposures. This constitutes about 1% of our overall deposit portfolio and speaks to the underlying quality of our book.  Deposits in the Corporate Bank declined by 7% sequentially or 6% if adjusted for FX, mostly due to normalizations from elevated levels in the last 2 quarters as well as increased pricing competition. Private Bank deposits declined by 2% in the quarter. Approximately 30% of flows migrated into higher-yielding investment products in the Private Bank, while the remainder reflected the ongoing inflationary pressures and increasing price competition.  Before we move to performance in our businesses, let me turn to capital on Slide 17. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio came in at 13.6%, up by 25 basis points compared to the previous quarter. Net capital build was 30 basis points reflecting our strong organic capital generation from net income, partially offset by higher equity compensation awards. Risk-weighted assets grew modestly, reducing the CET1 ratio by only 6 basis points. Credit risk-weighted assets increased primarily due to seasonal loan growth in the Investment Bank and Corporate Bank. Market risk RWA declined slightly following ECB approved reduction in our qualitative multiplier add-on.  The leverage ratio was 4.6% at quarter end, up 6 basis points on the previous quarter, mainly due to higher retained earnings. And finally, we continue to operate with loss-absorbing capacity well above our requirements. Our MREL surplus as our most binding constraint has increased by EUR 1 billion to EUR 19 billion over the quarter.  Moving to the Corporate Bank on Slide 19. Corporate Bank revenues in the first quarter of EUR 2 billion were 35% higher year-on-year, driven by increased interest rates and continued pricing discipline. This was the highest quarterly revenue performance since the formation of the Corporate Bank, driven by revenue growth across all regions and business units. However, as we highlighted at our fourth quarter results, we expect a normalization of our interest revenues in the second half of the year. Our first quarter results were supported by still very benign pass-through rates, which we believe marks the peak revenue impact of this pricing dynamic.  Momentum was particularly strong in cash management with corporate, institutional and business banking clients as well as in Corporate Trust. Loan volume in the Corporate Bank was EUR 121 billion, down by EUR 4 billion compared to the prior year quarter and flat sequentially. Deposits were EUR 269 billion, essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter, but down 7% from elevated prior quarter levels, as I have just outlined.  Credit loss provisions remained contained despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment and were primarily driven by one larger Stage 3 event, which was offset in revenues by insurance recoveries. Credit loss provisions remained well below the prior year quarter, which was impacted by the start of the war in Ukraine.  Noninterest expenses were EUR 1.1 billion, an increase of 2% year-on-year, driven by higher internal service cost allocations, partly offset by a lower bank levy contribution. Profit before tax was EUR 822 million in the quarter, more than triple the prior year quarter. The cost income ratio improved to 55% and post-tax return on tangible equity was 18.3% despite the recognition of bank levies.  I'll now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 20. Revenues for the first quarter were 19% lower year-on-year. Revenues in fixed sales and trading decreased by 17% in the first quarter compared to a prior year, which included approximately EUR 500 million of episodic items. Client flows were robust with institutional activity broadly flat year-on-year and underlying business performance strong despite the extreme market volatility in March.  Rates revenues were higher compared to a very strong prior year quarter, reflecting improvements across the platform and effective risk management. Credit trading, financing and emerging markets revenues were lower, principally reflecting the absence of episodic items in the prior year period, while underlying performance improved. Foreign exchange revenues were significantly lower compared to a strong prior year period, driven by the impact of extreme interest rate volatility and market dislocation during March.  Moving to origination and advisory. Revenues were down 31% in a market which remained challenging. Our performance was in line with the industry fee pool and reflected a market share recovery and a shift in the underlying product mix compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Debt origination revenues were significantly lower. Volumes remain low in leveraged loans, although the market did start to see a partial recovery in high yield. Investment-grade debt revenues also declined as did the industry fee pool. Equity origination revenues were down in a challenging market with limited issuance. Revenues in advisory were significantly lower, though by less than the industry fee pool decline.  Turning to costs. Both noninterest expenses and adjusted costs were essentially flat versus the prior year as reduced bank levies were largely offset by investments in technology and our control functions. Loan balances increased year-on-year, driven by higher originations primarily in the financing businesses. Quarter-on-quarter balances were essentially flat with lower origination reflecting our selective risk deployment. Provision for credit losses was EUR 41 million, 16 basis points of average loans, a slight increase on the prior year. Profit before tax was EUR 861 million in the quarter.  Turning to the Private Bank on Slide 21. Private Bank revenues were EUR 2.4 billion in the first quarter, up 10% year-on-year and marked the highest quarterly revenues since the beginning of our transformation of the Private Bank, excluding specific revenue items. Revenues in the Private Bank Germany increased by 14% to EUR 1.6 billion. Higher net interest income from deposits more than compensated for a decline in fee income, which reflected changes in contractual and regulatory conditions, market uncertainty and to a lesser extent, lower client activity.  In the International Private Bank, revenues were up 3%. Revenues in Wealth Management and bank for entrepreneurs were up 4% or 7% if adjusted for the impact of the sale of our Financial Advisors business in Italy. Revenues in premium banking declined by 1%.  Noninterest expenses were up 10%, partly due to the nonrecurrence of releases of restructuring provisions, which benefited the prior year quarter. Adjusted costs increased by 5% year-on-year due to higher internal service cost allocations, higher investment spending, including costs related to the Postbank IT migration and inflation impacts, partly offset by lower bank levies and savings from transformation initiatives.  Net inflows were EUR 6 billion in the quarter, driven by growth in investment products in both Germany and the International Private Bank. Provision for credit losses was EUR 267 million, up from EUR 101 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven mainly by a small number of single name losses in the International Private Bank. Excluding these items, the development of the portfolio continued to reflect the high quality of the loan book and continued risk discipline.  Profit before tax was EUR 280 million in the quarter, including the full year impact of bank levy charges. Cost-to-income ratio was 78% in the quarter with a post-tax return on tangible equity of 5%.  Let me continue with Asset Management on Slide 22. My usual reminder, the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. As you will have seen in their materials, DWS reported a decline in performance compared to the prior year, reflecting lower market levels. Sequentially, assets under management increased to EUR 841 billion, reflecting EUR 19 billion of market appreciation and net inflows. Inflows excluding cash, were nearly EUR 9 billion primarily in passive and multi-asset. Flows in cash products were very volatile throughout the quarter, ending with net outflows of EUR 3 billion.  Revenues declined by 14% versus the prior year quarter. This was predominantly driven by an 8% decline in management fees to EUR 571 million, which reflected financial market performance during 2022. Performance and transaction fees were also lower year-on-year from performance fee recognition and lower real estate transaction fees. Other revenues declined on lower gains from co-investments and a smaller benefit from fair value of guarantees.  Noninterest expenses and adjusted costs increased by 3% and 1%, respectively. Profit before tax of EUR 115 million in the quarter was down 44% compared to prior year. The cost income ratio for the quarter was 74%. And return on tangible equity was 14%.  Moving to Corporate & Other on Slide 23. A reminder that Corporate & Other now includes the impact of our legacy portfolios previously reported as the Capital Release Unit. Corporate & Other reported a pretax loss of EUR 226 million this quarter, a significant improvement from the pretax loss of EUR 677 million in the first quarter of 2022. The year-on-year improvement was principally driven by valuation and timing differences, which were positive EUR 239 million in this quarter compared to negative EUR 184 million in the prior year quarter.  The pretax loss associated with our legacy portfolios was EUR 130 million, an improvement of EUR 166 million year-on-year, primarily driven by lower expenses. Excluding bank levies, adjusted costs associated with these portfolios approximately halved to EUR 66 million.  Funding and liquidity impacts were negative EUR 106 million in the current quarter versus negative EUR 127 million in the prior year quarter. Expenses associated with shareholder activities not allocated to the business divisions as defined in the OECD transfer pricing guidelines were EUR 124 million in this quarter, essentially flat year-on-year. The reversal of noncontrolling interests in the operating businesses, primarily from DWS was positive EUR 37 million down from EUR 56 million in the prior year quarter. Other impacts reported in the segment aggregated to negative EUR 142 billion.  Risk-weighted assets stood at EUR 43 billion at the end of the first quarter, including EUR 19 billion of operational risk RWA, representing a EUR 3 billion reduction since the fourth quarter of 2022.  Turning to the group outlook for 2023 on Slide 24. We remain focused on delivering positive operating leverage. We expect 2023 revenues around the midpoint of a range between EUR 28 billion and EUR 29 billion. We expect to keep our noninterest expenses broadly flat to 2022. As confirmed earlier, we expect the monthly run rate of adjusted costs, excluding bank levies to be about EUR 1.6 billion to EUR 1.65 billion for the rest of the year.  To deliver on the cost reduction measures, which Christian outlined, we now expect to record restructuring and severance provisions of approximately EUR 500 million in 2023. In line with our previous guidance, provision for credit losses is expected in the range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans.  Christian mentioned our commitment to capital distributions. Consistent with our path laid out at the Investor Deep Dive last year, we have proposed a cash dividend of EUR 0.30 per share for approval at the AGM in May, and the dialogue with supervisors about share buybacks in the second half of the year has been initiated. We are also committed to maintaining a strong capital position and a solid liquidity and funding base, all of which we demonstrated during turbulent conditions in the first quarter.  With that, let me hand back to , and we look forward to your questions.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you. Operator, we would be ready to take the first question, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Chris Hallam from Goldman Sachs.\nChris Hallam: So my first question relates to capital return. Clearly, profitability and capital formation was better than expected in the first quarter. Previously, you've commented that the timing and size of potential share buybacks here would be dependent on getting clarity on the size of regulatory model headwinds and the macro outlook. And today, you've said that you've initiated dialogue with the ECB. So what updates do you have on those headwinds? How comfortable do you feel on the macro backdrop? And how far are you with the ECB discussions? And what does that all mean for the potential timing and size of share buybacks this year? That's the first question.  And then secondly, perhaps to Christian, coming back to Slide 7. If we look across those three pillars, cost, capital and revenues, could you talk a little bit about what these measures really mean incrementally to the 2025 strategy and targets? What are the key timing points regarding progress in those areas? And are you in a position to upgrade any of those targets at this point?\nChristian Sewing: Chris, it's Christian. Thank you very much for your question. And I'm sure James will jump in. I'm going after both questions, and again, James will contribute.  Look, on your first question, I think it was very important for us, for the Management Board here and for James and myself that we wanted to see the first quarter development. And indeed, this development is not only important but gives us all the confidence and all the tailwind we need when it comes to the further trajectory of our results.  And you really look at the composition of our results. That's what makes me so positive and confident that is the stable business development in the Private Bank and in the Corporate Bank. And if you then think about that what James already outlined in the previous calls and what we always refer to that kind of the real tailwind in the interest rates is coming in the Private Bank only in the outer years in '24 and '25. With the momentum we see right now already in the stable business, that was obviously the right starting point now to change gears and to initiate the discussions on the share buybacks with the ECB.  Secondly, to take a step back, I think also in the aftermath, it was right actually not to do this end of January because we said on purpose, we would like to have a better view on the economic development, the volatility in the market, the turbulences we see. And look, we did not know what happened in March, but you could see that also the way we handled that situation. Again, the stability now with a step up of 13.6%, not even talking about the strong liquidity number of 143%, all gives us now the confidence to say this is the right moment to start.  Thirdly, I do believe that the environment, the economic outlook for Europe, particular for Germany, you may have seen the guidance of the German Economic Minister yesterday that -- and we agree to that, we don't see a recession in Germany coming in '23. It's slow growth, a minimal growth but actually far better than that what we thought could happen at the end of 2022 for the year '23. Also there, clearly better visibility when it comes to the economic outlook.  And James will give you more details when it comes to the model changes, but also there, we did a lot of progress and have far better visibility, what it means. And in this regard, we concluded based on this, in our view, really good number -- quarter 1 numbers that it's now time to approach the discussions, initiate the discussions with regard to timing.  In line with that, what I said on February 2, we believe that the share buybacks will happen in the second half of 2023. There, I used the word optimistic. Now I use the word that I'm very confident that this will happen in the second half of '23.  And with regard to the amount, look, I think we need to have the discussions with the ECB. But James and I are both believe in consistency. If you think about the kind of the increase in the dividends, which we proposed for the year '22 versus the previous year, I think for consistent reasons, we should also think about such an increase when it comes to share buybacks.  James, potentially, you step in on the model before I take the second question.\nJames von Moltke: Sure. Happy to do that. So Chris, remember in the February call, we were talking about the model impacts. There are a number of different items, one big one, which is what we call the wholesale model review but then many other items, some of which are netting. And so there is a range of outcomes. But at this point, with better visibility into the discussions, we'd probably say that range is between 40 and 60 basis points of capital.  If you take the midpoint of that, which is a pretty good place to be for modeling purposes, that 50 basis points actually represents about the capital -- the organic capital generation that consensus would suggest we earn in the balance of the year. Now obviously, we'd like to do better than that. But if you use that, essentially, earnings for the rest of the year would offset the model impact. And that leaves us sort of the gap to 13.2 to fund growth, a buyback and any other events during the year, uncertainties in the first two numbers, which we feel pretty good about. And to give you a sense that, therefore, the range of outcomes that Christian refers to, we think at this point is affordable based on the information we have.\nChristian Sewing: To your second question, and Page 7, look, again, first of all, I really would like to say it is nothing else Chris, than the continuous development of our strategy and the confirmation of the strategy and the trajectory which we have taken over the last years. But of course, when you are in the middle of that, you see the client reaction, you see the momentum I was just talking about before also in the stable business. the foundation and the resilience, which we have found in the Investment Bank, and obviously, you always reconsider what else can we do.  And let me start on the business side. So on the right-hand side of the slide. Number one, yes, momentum in the business is so important because it goes back to something which I always try to outline in this call and which I think sometimes gets still underestimated, but that is all about our people. If they see these results, when you think about the momentum, the passion, the spirit in this bank, you can see that, in particular now in the Corporate and the Private Bank, it goes only into one direction, and that's what we want to build on. We see growth rates, which are higher than that what we initially planned.  Now then there are market opportunities. Also, as a result of the events which we have seen in our competitive environment also here in Europe, which obviously we would like to bank on. And you have seen the one or the other announcement over the last weeks that we will start to do some selective hiring. Very important either in the Corporate Bank platform or in capital-light businesses like the advisory piece. You also see that we are actually focusing on additional markets. We have hired a team for Latin America in the O&A and financing business, which is important for us because a lot of German clients, corporate clients are actually there who want to have our help. So market opportunities are there.  And all that gives us actually the opportunity again, with the momentum we see also when I look forward, and obviously, with the tailwind of the interest rates that we think the revenue growth numbers which we put forward are not only achievable, but we have a real chance to outperform that.  Now secondly, obviously, on the cost management side, if you work on those EUR 2 billion, which we always laid out and where we gave details in last year's IDD, and we always reconfirm the numbers, you then go deeper, you see there is more room. And therefore, we also changed the governance in the Management Board. We have a clear allocation of cost management now in the management board, front to back, which will create further opportunities. And I think we also don't only think about long-term or more long-term cost changes, but the reduction in force exercise which we kicked off in March, which will be actually then fully implemented in Q2 is something which shows you that we see now with all that what has happened with the sharpening of our businesses, but also implementation of front-to-end processes that we have more potential than we saw before. And hence, we believe that the additional EUR 500 million is the target and a goal which we should achieve.  And thirdly, capital efficiency. And to be honest, to criticize ourselves, I think we have done a very good capital management. But when it comes to capital efficiency in each and every sub businesses, we can further step up. And what I like about this exercise, which we, in our view, bring approximately EUR 15 billion to EUR 20 billion of risk-weighted assets over the next couple of years in risk-weighted asset reductions while not losing revenues over that is actually a more disciplined capital allocation. And that is on 2 or 3 items.  Number one, yes, we will act on items which we see, for instance, in the German mortgage business. If the countercyclical capital buffer has been increased like it was, we obviously will act and will move capital out of this business and either shift it to higher rewarding businesses or we give it back to the shareholders. Secondly, we have found ways to increase hedging securitizations. And thirdly, discipline is not only on the cost side. It's in particular on the review of each and every individual reward when it comes to lending. And there, we need to step up.  And I think that there are areas in our banks, also in the Corporate Bank, where we can do better when it comes to risk reward, that will be implemented. James will be all over about it. And those three items on top of that, what we have seen in Q1, and I really would like to focus on that again. It's an 8.3% return on equity. But if you , so to say, the SRF, we are at 10%. We know exactly what happens with the SRF payments. It will go down. And we still have something in plan for '24 and '25, but it will go down.  So the 10% RoTE in the first quarter is a really good guidance because the first quarter is not an outlier quarter. If you now think about these three items, obviously, it is our target to outperform that in '25. And this is the confidence we have. And with all that, what we really see in numbers in the first quarter was the whole trajectory, I'm really excited about that way and hence, very positive that we can achieve that outperformance. James, I don't know whether you...\nJames von Moltke: No, nothing to add. Completely agree.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Tom Hallett from KBW.\nThomas Hallett: So a few questions for me, please. Firstly, on deposits. We saw EUR 27 billion of outflows. But could you just give us a sense of how that evolved throughout the quarter, particularly in and around that market period? And maybe further out, what are you seeing quarter-to-date? And how do you see those deposit trends developing throughout the year? Secondly, you're sticking to your revenue guidance. I'm just wondering what gives you the confidence that target still holds, given the miss in trading, given what we're seeing quarter-to-date there? So maybe you could just provide a little bit an update by division, quarter-to-date dynamics, that would be helpful.  And one final quick one. I'm interested in your discussions with regulators around the CVS issues and the wider banking crisis. Do you envisage any change coming maybe through things like liquidity coverage ratio, definition changes or some sort of additional levies to ensure a wider scope for deposits? Any sense where you see change would be great.\nJames von Moltke: Sure. Thanks, Tom. It's James. I'll start. Maybe I'll start where you finished, and we'll come back to that with the liquidity metrics because we manage to the liquidity metrics rather than do absolute levels of deposits or funding, and I think it's important to emphasize we were able to travel through a difficult quarter and especially March, while maintaining and, in fact, improving both ratios -- liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio. And so it's important to understand what that means.  We ended the quarter in as good or better position to withstand a 30-day or a 1-year stress environment than we were at year-end based on that strong deposit base as well as the secured and unsecured funding position we are in. And we think that's a significant achievement for Deutsche Bank but also for the industry. I'll talk about this when we go to your third question, but I think LCR and these other tools have withstood the test in the month of March.  Turning to deposits. You mentioned the reduction in the deposits over the course of the quarter. The average deposits were down a little less than 2% over the quarter. And as you've seen, the spot level was down 4%, excluding FX. And that, as we look at sort of banks that have reported so far, we think is -- and some market -- sort of industry data through February is reasonably in line with what you've seen on both sides of the Atlantic so far.  Now as we've talked about, there's a lot going on in the deposit books. Normalization in our case, from very high levels of deposits that we finished the year with. There was sort of a run-up in December, which is one of the reasons for the variance between the average and the spot. You've also seen a pickup in competition for liquidity as central banks did drained liquidity from the market and you do see some price-sensitive deposits leaving the bank. We're just disciplined on pricing. And so that represents, if you like, a strategy outcome.  We have seen clients shift deposits to higher-yielding investment alternatives, including but not limited to money market funds. And some of that, as we've pointed out, within our own system. So it didn't leave the bank. It just went from deposits to other products.  The other thing that happens in our deposit base is sort of usual ebbs and flows. So if you're a very large cash management bank for corporates and institutionals, there's a lot of movement throughout the quarter which means that your specific question is a little bit hard to pinpoint. But I would -- and what we've talked about is sort of 2/3 coming in the first, say, 9 or 10 weeks of the quarter and then 1/3 in the last 2 weeks, including the sort of episodic or idiosyncratic noise around our name. We think that 1% or 1.5%, which is what we'd estimate over those last 7 or 8 sort of business days of the quarter actually underscores the resilience of the deposit base and the relative absence of what I'll call hot money at DB.  Where did you see it? It was in the portfolios that are typically the most price sensitive and sensitive, if you like, to sentiment. So in a sense, it's not surprising to see that amount of reduction. And as we come back to your LCR question, I think it proves its value as a tool because the reality, why did the ratio stay constant, we don't apply liquidity value to the -- those funding sources, including deposits that are most likely to flow out in a stress scenario.  So if I put that all together, Tom, we feel pretty good about the experience and the way we were able to manage through that environment. And credit to the teams. The communication, the client outreach and engagement, the work that was done in preparation, we feel quite good about performance through that period.\nChristian Sewing: Some to the other question on the revenue guidance, high confidence in the midpoint of EUR 28 billion to EUR 29 billion. And why? Because I'm really drawing a lot of comfort actually from the stable business. If there is even room for improvement, it comes from the Private Bank and the Corporate Bank. And if I give you sort of say, my numbers, which I have in my head, even if you say the first quarter in the Corporate Bank was a stellar quarter where potentially on the deposit better, we may see some reduction. But clearly, the Corporate Bank will be well above EUR 7 billion of revenues for the year.  I mean we started with the EUR 1.9 billion. And again, if I all see the forecast and the momentum we have there, it will be clearly a number well above EUR 7 billion. The Private Bank, in my view, very stable. And again, think about that what we always said before that the real impact of the tailwind is still to come. So if I look at last year, if I look at this year, if I look at the first quarter, kind of a number well above EUR 9 billion is well achievable in the Private Bank.  Asset Management, again, a EUR 2.5 billion number with all that, what I can see well achievable. So I think the stable business will be well in excess of EUR 19 billion. If you then think about the EUR 28.5 billion, it's approximately EUR 9 billion, which we need from the Investment Bank.  Now again, I think James said it in his prepared remarks, very strong business actually in the Investment Bank. The episodic items, which we recorded in the first quarter of 2022, we always knew that this is not repeatable, but the underlying flow in the Investment Bank is strong. I just told you about additional investments, which we did also Latin America and so on. So I think what we need to achieve just in order to come to the EUR 28.5 billion would be something like a EUR 9 billion of revenues in the Investment Bank. We took EUR 2.7 billion in. That would mean, on average, a EUR 2.1 billion quarterly, which we have seen and where I'm highly confident to get there, again, based on the momentum. And hence, you know what, the guidance stands, and I'm confident.\nJames von Moltke: On LCR, we'll always back test. I think the industry and working with regulators, we'll back test what we call the outflow assumptions or the liquidity risk drivers. We'll incorporate what we learn into our own internal models and discuss with regulators as an industry, whether there are changes to LCR that are necessary.  I'll tell you that the experience of the last several years, the COVID crisis in 2020, the impact of the inception of the war in Ukraine last year, now the banking sector turbulence, all of those things have actually proven out rather than disprove the severity of the liquidity risk drivers. So we feel really good about what the tool tells us.  You mentioned the CDS market. We think CDS is an important risk management tool as well, helping banks and counterparties manage credit risk. That said, it's an illiquid market, relatively speaking, and is prone to movements that may not reflect a realistic assessment of default probability. And so I think it probably does bear some scrutiny as to how that market works and whether there are ways to improve it.  Let's be clear, I think institutionally and speaking personally, we think short selling is a viable activity. It provides information to the marketplace and is not something that we would criticize in and of itself. The question is, is there a possibility for crosstalk between different parts of the capital structure that really doesn't represent information in the marketplace. And hence, it's something that does bear some -- As I say, we went through this period, which was an idiosyncratic focus, I think, well. In a sense, we were tested, and we showed ourselves to be a strong, stable bank without the vulnerabilities that the market was concerned about. And in a sense, that's a good thing that clients and investors and counterparties were able to see that. So I'd probably leave it there, Tom.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Anke Reingen from RBC.\nAnke Reingen: The first is on costs. If you can talk a bit about the outlook and guidance. With respect to 2023, Q1 is running in line with the target of flat adjusted and reported. And if we look for the rest of the year, do you see any potential headwinds to your cost target? I mean you mentioned hiring. Is there a risk that we don't end up on a flat adjusted reported cost basis? And in that respect, just confirming the EUR 500 million restructuring costs are incorporated in your flat cost guidance.  And then if we travel from '23 to '25, is that like essentially flat trajectory as well? Or when do the EUR 2.5 billion cost savings come through and other EUR 500 million like an additional saving in your cost path you modeled? Or is it basically offsetting additional headwinds you weren't seeing initially?  And the cost/income ratio target, I realized you've made lots of progress, but still 62.5% looks quite ambitious. What levers do you think you can pull? Or where is the upside potential from where we stand at the moment?  And then second question is on loan losses. Unchanged guidance of 25 to 30 basis points. Q1 is already 30 basis points and your assumption is avoiding a recession in Germany. So how confident are you on your loan loss provision guidance?\nJames von Moltke: So Anke, thank you for the questions. I'll dive in and Chris, you may want to add. I'll go in reverse order, if I may, Look, as we've talked about, the EUR 372 million this quarter is probably higher than we would have expected, and in particular focus is on the around EUR 120 million that we recognized on the two -- these two individual exposures in the IPB. If you take that out, EUR 250 million in the quarter, is actually a sensible run rate and would certainly deliver on the range and guidance that we've given. We're not seeing indicators at this point of weakness in credit. So as we look at the forward-looking indicators, ratings movements, Stage 2 events and all the metrics we look at, we're just not seeing it yet. We are obviously mindful of the environment that we're in and watching carefully. But to your question about, do the trends support the range, yes, they do. So we're comfortable there.  The question on the path to '25 on cost income ratio, what's the lever? The lever is operating leverage. What we highlighted back in February is that the sort of the cumulative, if you like, the compound rate of operating leverage improvement over the 4 years from '18 was 5% a year. Now we may not achieve that every year, but it doesn't take 5% a year to get us to 62.5% from 67%. And so that's also why we've defined the strategy as we have and why we define acceleration as we've done.  If we can find ways to accelerate revenue growth and at least manage the expense base flat with some of the additional measures that we're taking, at least offsetting additional investments and hopefully bringing a little bit more to the bottom line over that time, we think the math to get to 62.5% is very solid. And as Christian outlined, we'd hope to be able to make that a more easily achievable target, and as I say, potentially create room for reinvestment.  The '23 path, as you say, is one where, as other headwinds, there are always headwinds. We are making investments, whether it's in technology or controls. We're seeing inflation. And we need to work to offset those things. The initiatives we announced today are not that meaningful in terms of '23. So they might help us to the tune of around EUR 50 million in the back half of the year. But they step up over the next couple of years. And so the run rate that we think to the various initiatives that we're talking about should achieve by '25 or if not dribbling a little bit into '26, would be about EUR 250 million. So we think it's a meaningful sort of contribution to the EUR 500 million goal that we have.  We're seeing a number of things. Obviously, in the expense base we've talked about, we're going to continue to fight through now in the second quarter. Work hard to keep the company at that run rate we've talked about. In the second half, we actually start to harvest some benefits of things we've been working on for a while. I think notably, as we complete the integration, while it doesn't immediately happen, we start to harvest the benefits of that investment.  We've talked about the linearity and nonlinearity of certain elements of the EUR 2 billion. So we will continue to work and harvest those. So the short answer is, of course, it's always challenging to manage a company in an environment like this with so many moving parts to a run rate. But we think we've got the tools and the measures in place to do that, and we've got an intense amount of management focus on it. And as Christian says, even more so with Rebecca's expanded responsibilities.\nChristian Sewing: Anke, the only point I want to add, James said it all, but potentially a number which helps you is the Q1 loan loss provisions ex these two, in my view, idiosyncratic items in the IPB was actually 21 basis points. And that tells you also something about the robustness and solidity of Deutsche Bank's credit portfolio.  With the statements James just made that also going forward and the behavior of our credit portfolios, we cannot really see a negative development or a negative outlook. Hopefully, this 21 basis points also gives you a little bit of guidance or hopefully, comfort for our overall full year guidance.\nAnke Reingen: If I may just come back to the cost path, given some of EUR 2.5 billion is more back-end loaded cost savings. The idea is still to be essentially flat over '23, '24, '25.\nJames von Moltke: That's right. And look, one thing and I think it was embedded in your question, I apologize. The restructuring and severance is higher than we would have planned for the year. That is true. In a sense, we've had an opportunity arise based on a lower-than-expected single resolution fund assessment. So we think we've been given an opportunity even with that investment to manage to the original guidance we gave you this year.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Stuart Graham from Autonomous Research.\nStuart Graham: I had two, please. First is coming back on the LCR. You set the 130% target sometime ago, and I guess, what was a pre-Twitter world. And I think we've all been shocked at how quickly nonsticky retail and corporate deposits can move nowadays. So given the power of social media, don't you think that 130% needs to be higher nowadays? That's the first question.  And then the second question is U.S. commercial real estate office exposure. Thank you for the extra granularity on Slide 38. That's really been useful. Could I also ask how much of that EUR 4.5 billion book is criticized? And what your loan loss allowances on that book are, please?\nJames von Moltke: Sure, Stuart. It's early days with respect to LCR and the items that you mentioned. I mean, yes, we've learned a painful lesson about the speed at which information and arguably, in some cases, misinformation travel in a social media world and the relatively frictionless movement of funds that we have. I think the important lesson is confidence in banking institutions is critical. I think that confidence arises from banks getting the basics right. We think we've got the basics right at Deutsche Bank. And those are -- deposit bases and funding, managing risks carefully, ensuring that you're really adding value for clients. You have a sustainable business model.  And all of these elements, does it affect how you think about LCR? I think LCR is misunderstood in the sense that it is very conservative. And because the banks have chosen since it was introduced to manage to buffers that there's room in that ratio. I think it's important to understand, if a bank hits 100% that -- in our case, we have now 43% margin against the 100%. But at 100%, we're still able to extend a 30-day stress and come outstanding. So it's a conservatively constructed ratio.  You have to remember also that things that flow off the balance sheet affect both the numerator and the depositor -- and the denominator. And so you have this dynamic nature of the ratio on the way down. So it's -- there's a number of interesting features about that tool that would suggest it's -- as it is, it's a very sort of powerful stability driver in the industry.  That doesn't mean we won't examine it. We won't examine individual risk drivers, but my hope is that a combination of the basics and the tools we have today are -- put us in a good place.\nStuart Graham: So -- if the Basel committee chose to recalibrate it, you could run with a lower buffer. It wouldn't have to be 130%. It might be 110% -- a more conservatively stated LCR. I know it's a theoretical discussion, but...\nJames von Moltke: Theoretically, yes. And we're mindful, Stuart, that there is a cost to holding these buffers, right? That our shareholders essentially are paying for that buffer. It needs to be there. Let's be clear. The sustainability of a bank, which is engaged in maturity transformation relies on that buffer being there. But you want to calibrate it to a level that protects safety and soundness in essentially all market conditions, but then isn't so inefficient that it's an unreasonable tax on shareholders. So that balance is an interesting one, and I think we need to continue to examine.  In general, by the way, banks -- we've -- since the crisis, we have this behavior of preserving buffers. So banks manage now not just with buffers, but with a disincentive to see buffers used. And so I think that whole edifice, in a sense, can be discussed and examined.  But -- and I just want to draw a line under it, in a positive way, the stability and the tools and the post-crisis regulation I think, should be understood as a success based on what we've learned over the past 8 weeks rather than the opposite.  Briefly on commercial real estate, we don't actually look at it in U.S. terms around criticized necessarily in our IFRS accounting. But what I can tell you is that EUR 1.6 billion, so a little bit more than 1/3 would be in Stages 1 and -- sorry, Stages 2 and 3. We think there's -- we're not saying we're immune. We think we're well underwritten. We have a stable portfolio. We think project by project, we're in good shape given the market environment. But there, of course, are loans, maybe EUR 600 million of that EUR 1.6 billion that we're looking at carefully and need to work with the sponsors around extension dates and refinancings to make sure it carries through this market environment without more scratches and bruises.\nStuart Graham: And the stock of provisions on that book?\nJames von Moltke: Stock provisions is, I think, in total, around probably EUR 50 million against the Stage 3, not against that EUR 1.6 billion, but -- to Stage 3.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Nicolas Payen from Kepler Cheuvreux.\nNicolas Payen: I have two. The first one would be on the revenue path going into 2024. You mentioned that we might have seen the peak in terms of interest rates repricing, you have a bit of deposit shift and increasing beta as well as slowing growth in mortgages and loans in general. So what do you think about revenues going into 2024? And the second question, sorry to come back on the idiosyncratic event of March. But as you mentioned, you have a strong liquidity buffer, conservative risk management. And if you were one of the most banks under pressure from a stock price point of view in March, what can you do to change the perception about the riskiness and the stronger fundamental of the ?\nJames von Moltke: So I don't know if you want to start. Revenue path, look, I'll make a couple of comments. Christian will I'm sure add. Look, we're not at a point where -- I'll start with the Investment Bank because that's where our investors tend to start. I don't think we're at a point of sort of peak revenue potential in the Investment Bank. Because just if you think about where we are, for example, right now in Origination & Advisory, that's still sort of recovering. So we think there's scope to improve there. As Christian mentioned, I think we've got scope to invest in that area and improve our market shares, leave aside the market wallet performance.  Financing is doing quite well, both in volume sort of -- or market opportunity terms and in spreads. And then I think our markets businesses have been strong performers and also risk managers. Of course, in that business, we're going to ride a little bit the volatility and the volumes in the marketplace, but we feel good about the way the business has come together under Ram's leadership. So all of those things would tell us we can at least sustain and perhaps improve on the Investment Bank.  The -- Christian mentioned earlier, Private Bank still has a way to run in terms of the momentum that interest rates deliver, let alone assets under management, loan and deposit growth in the case of loans at loans outside of mortgages. So we feel comfortable there's a good path there. And while some of the -- I think we're probably past peak lag, but we're not past the generalized improvement in the rate environment in Corporate Bank.  Lastly, I think the Asset Management business by executing the plan Stefan Hoops has laid out has a clear path to growth in assets. Obviously, it will ride the market a little bit but is also not anywhere near sort of its peak revenue potential. So all of those things, I think, feed into '24 and then '25, and there is sort of a sustainable momentum built into that.  Your second question was liquidity in March and what can we do? Look, we're acutely aware that -- I don't think we were singled out uniquely, but we were in a group that were potentially perceived as vulnerable to the issues that arose. As I said earlier, it's gratifying that the market can very quickly identify that those vulnerabilities did not exist with us or, frankly, our peers in Europe that might otherwise have also come in to pressure.  I think the answer to your question is the more we execute on our strategy, the more we deliver sustainable profitability but also the more we put historical issues around control failures and other events in the past. I hope that what I would -- some call muscle memory will fade in the market and the sort of the beta nature of Deutsche Bank will fade.  As a management team, I think we're all very committed to achieving that goal. It lies in our hands to some extent around execution. It lies in investors' hands in terms of their support for our securities.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Adam Terelak from Mediobanca.\nAdam Terelak: I had one on NII and one on capital. Could you give us a little bit of update on the NII trajectory from here? Clearly, expectation on rates have gone up but also deposit betas seem to be low. So just a bit of color on both sides of the balance sheet there and what that means for this year's guidance. And just to add kind of what your deposit assumptions are from here within that guidance, the full year '23 and beyond?  And then secondly, on capital, Christian, you mentioned the EUR 15 billion to EUR 20 billion of RWA relief. I just want to understand your guys thinking on how to redeploy that kind of EUR 2 billion plus potentially of capital unlocked whether that's going to go back into the balance sheet, what businesses you see growth in or kind of what decisions would come to returning that to shareholders, as you mentioned?  And finally, just a clarification. On 4Q, you were talking about kind of the regulatory inflation to come with offset. Is the market risk benefit you've taken this quarter the offsetting item that we've discussed in previous quarters?\nJames von Moltke: So Adam, I'm not sure I follow all the questions, but let me start with NII trajectory. What I do is refer you back to Page 26 of the February 2 materials. Now we're not going to update the NII trajectory sort of every quarter. But I would say that the assumptions there on Page 26 are still pretty good assumptions. There are always movements up and down in how NII will perform. But this idea that we would put on at that time, 900, I think it's actually a little bit better than 900 given assumptions have improved relative to our expectations at that time this year is still a really good assumption.  So we did EUR 13.65 billion of net interest income last year. If that grew by EUR 1 billion or more, that would be a good assumption. There might be sort of a plateau or even a small dip in '24. And then as you see, there's another leg up in '25 as the interest rate characteristics in the Private Bank come through. So that -- I think that guidance still holds.  Now one thing just to advise you, if you look at interest income in Q1 and attempt to annualize it, you won't get to that number precisely because as we highlight, there's been a swing in the characteristic of the revenue recognition. Think of it a little bit like trading NIM in the U.S. banks, more of the revenues were characterized as fair value through P&L in Q1 than would be typical, and we can get into the reasons for that. But -- so don't be concerned that there's any difference in the guidance from that sort of anomaly. We're very comfortable with the guidance that we've given. And actually, at the moment, we're seeing, based on the curve and the funding profile, we see a little bit of upside to our earlier guidance.\nChristian Sewing: And Adam, on your capital question, look, one thing is clear, if you see market opportunities like I tried to describe it, obviously, some of RWA optimizations, we will certainly reinvest also into the one or the other business. But clearly, we also believe that with the increased profitability, which we expect and with that capital efficiency, which we outlined on Page 7. And by the way, again, this has not been only a top-down but bottom-up analysis, which we even curtailed a bit top-down. So there is real potential. Of course, we will think about how much of these additional savings we can also hand back to our shareholders.  So I think if you ask me today, it will be a combination of reinvestment into those business, which is really then capital rewarding and where we have a very good story for our shareholders and investors, but part of that will be also given back to the shareholders.\nJames von Moltke: And maybe just to build on that, what Christian said, to give you a bit more specific guidance, we -- if I look at the consensus RWA number for 2025, which is 422, without wanting to get pinned down to specific numbers because, as Christian says, it's quite dynamic. Think of the EUR 15 billion to EUR 20 billion as being a net reduction from that guidance. So we would expect, based on everything we know right now, to be somewhere in the low 400s, 400 to 410. And so that can give you a sense if you're building your model based on organic revenue generation, the Basel III impact that we've talked about of about EUR 30 billion of RWA gives you a little bit of sense of where it can provide, at the very least, additional support for the capital trajectory that we've laid out already.\nAdam Terelak: Great. The final point was whether the regulatory tailwinds you had this quarter was the kind of the offsetting item we've discussed against the model?\nJames von Moltke: No, it's all still -- there was -- the one item that we talked about was a market risk RWA item. That was in the plan but is not part of the net 40 to 60 that I talked about earlier.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan.\nKian Abouhossein: The first one is more a general question. I mean if I look at the turnaround of the bank, and I think Berlin should send you two medals, both to Christian and James, the market is clearly thinking differently. I mean, you're trading at 0.3x tangible book. You're trading at 5x roughly -- year's earnings. So there's a disconnect. And I'm just trying to understand how you're going to bridge that disconnect. And if there's going to be any change in the sense that you're going to overcommunicate maybe in Investor Day or any other measures that you feel are understood in particular, that we should be thinking about and investors should be thinking about?  And the second question is I'm quite interested in some management changes that you have announced. And clearly, you have being the COO and also being responsible for cost besides the transformation. Just wondering if there's any change in your thinking around cost? I mean it feels like there is from the language but just wondering if there's any -- and clearly, the EUR 500 million. But I wonder if there's any change in the way we should think about Deutsche and cost management going forward now relative to last year?\nChristian Sewing: Yes. Thank you, Kian. And look, let me try to start and James will jump in. Look, it's always hard to talk yourself about why we are perceived in the market as we are perceived. This is actually a question I would like to always hand back to you guys that you tell us what we can do better in communicating.  Look, I give you three items and one of that is not meant in any defensive way. But I do believe that if you just think 14 months back, where we stood in February 2022 before this awful war broke out, I think, at some point in time, we were a share price around 14 30 or something like that, not that this would be our ultimate goal, as you know. But you could see that actually people started to think about this is going into the right direction.  Now I still believe that the overall uncertainty -- the geopolitical uncertainty is a drag for us and that we are still kind of suffering from that. That is point number one.  Point number two is clearly that we have to show and we also hear it on this call, and I think it's only delivery, but you have two very resilient people here on this call. And we will drive this resilience, and we will show you quarter by quarter, week by week, month by month and day by day that we keep the ship exactly in this direction. But the composition of Deutsche Bank of the revenues completely changed.  We have 66% of revenues from the Corporate Bank, Private Bank and Asset Management. And if you would listen to me for another 2 hours, I can tell you these revenues in these businesses only have one direction. And it will -- this 66% will be kind of the ratio potentially, it even goes into an even more favorable number if you think about balanced versus -- a stable versus less stable business, it even goes into an even more favorable number.  So we have a bank which is now that balance, that stable from a profitability, from a sustainability of revenues that I'm very, very confident that we can show quarter-by-quarter a very sustainable development.  Now to the Investment Bank, to be honest, I think we are -- and again, potentially we need to do a better job, and I'm the first one who tries to learn. But I think the inner stability of the Investment Bank with all the changes we have done over the last 4 years is far stronger than potentially the market thinks about it. James just talked about the financing business, a very stable business. I think it's a financing business in the Investment Bank, which is, in my view, among the top 3 in the world. Also from an underwriting standards, if you think about the value chain from the first line of defense to the second line of defense.  I think it's a business where even others outside people of Deutsche and saying, this is -- honestly, this is top of the -- business. That is a business which is constantly there, continuously there with about EUR 3 billion of revenues. We have reconfigurated the trading business under Ram to one of the leading trading businesses. Again, if you look at Q1 and take out the idiosyncratic items, I'm just mentioning the name, which we talked about in '21 and '22, a lot, which obviously is not something which comes back every quarter, then the underlying business in the Investment Bank in 2022 in the first quarter -- 2023 in the first quarter was actually stronger than in the first quarter of 2022, despite it was a very strong quarter.  We will see now a comeback in the O&A business in the Investment Bank. We do some selective investments there because we see the market opportunities and we will be awake for these market opportunities. So that I think you have three very stable business with the interest rates still to come in one of our largest business, which is the Private Bank, with revenues above EUR 9 billion, clearly above EUR 9 billion. So that I think from a pure revenue point of view, I think this bank has completely turned around, and we are playing there where the clients want us to play and where we see the momentum.  Secondly, on the cost side, yes, we are now in the second phase, and I'm grateful for your question, Kian. We're in the second phase of real cost takeout. And that is a cost takeout, which now goes in particular, front to back, that we see the revised processes where we have invested a lot in the front offices, which now need to go into the infrastructure because we need one process from the originating to the infrastructure. And for that, we decided that all COOs in the infrastructure functions are now sub summarized under Rebecca so that we can do the changes in one process from the front office into the various infrastructure functions.  Secondly, when you have invested so much into controls and we are keep doing this, at some point in time, obviously, automation and machine learning, artificial intelligence, but in particular, automation will also lead over time to reduce cost. Unity will pay off as we said.  So what you now see in the second phase of taking cost out is not like in the first phase that we exited business, and we took those costs out but it's actually the smart takeout of cost, plus a constant revenue also of our workforce where we need to do something. So the reduction in force action is something which we have done now. And I'm sure we will do similar things in '24, '25 again. That is a constant review of our organization that's all now under Rebecca. And I think with one person driving that, we will even have more force on it.  So I think it's a normal development in transforming an organization but with the robustness and resilience of the revenues. And that discipline on the cost management, I do believe that we will show now quarter-by-quarter, year-by-year that this bank is on the right track. And at some point in time, I'm sure that also the investors will see that. If this is then even joined by hopefully, and this is, I think, the most important we should all look at that this awful war comes to an end at some point in time, I think that also Europe will be seen differently. And then latest then, we will also have relief from that side. With your medal item, actually, I will bring that message to Berlin.\nKian Abouhossein: By train -- take it, I hope.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Amit Goel from Barclays.\nAmit Goel: I've got two questions, kind of largely follow-ups. One, just on -- I'm just trying to gauge the size of potential share buybacks in the second half. If I use the math that you were talking about, you kind of suggested, I guess, off of a 13.6% to 13.2% CET1 ratio, 40 bps, so EUR 1.4 billion for buybacks, growth and other things. But then obviously, the last buyback was about EUR 300 million. So I'm just trying to get a sense of are you thinking of -- or have you asked the numbers in the kind of EUR 750 million to EUR 1 billion range? Or is it kind of closer to what was previously done?  And then the second question, just a follow-up on the LCR ratio. I guess in the end, I suppose I'm just wondering, are you going to continue to target 130% and trend down towards that level? And -- or are you going to look to keep the LCR similar to where it is today? And do you have a benefit in your plan on revenues for bringing that LCR down to 130%?\nJames von Moltke: Thanks, Amit. Look, your math is right. So the 40 basis points would represent something a little shy of EUR 1.5 billion, so use EUR 1.5 billion. As Christian indicated, we look at last year's buyback at EUR 300 million. And given the progress we've made -- and by the way, I don't want to be committed to a specific number, a specific timing, and it's too early, obviously, and we need to go through this with the supervisors in presenting a new capital plan. But a step forward on last year's number would be consistent with the guidance or the capital planning that we shared with you back in March of last year.  And as Christian mentioned to maybe give you a sense of ranging then, a 50% increase in dividend if that was mirrored also with the -- an increase of the buyback of a similar amount, it would give you a sense of a range of what we think it might be sought by us.  I will say that given the starting point of the 40 basis points, that's why we think it's -- this type of ask would be affordable. There' uncertainties in the environment. You would expect us to remain prudent. But as we say, with the buffers we have, we think we have space for something like that.  In LCR, we were very conscious as we went through Q1 that we had a high print at the end of December. That was frankly an accident. The average last quarter and the average this quarter are both almost exactly where you'd want it to be in this low 130% range. If we're targeting 130% then you'd expect us to be a little bit higher than 130%. I would -- I think for this quarter, we'd probably target a gentle decline. We are mindful that the risks in the outlook haven't entirely abated. But I wouldn't want you to be surprised if the number started with 130% next -- when we're talking with each other again in July.  As to the cost of that buffer, obviously, it does play a role, but it is very dynamic. So I wouldn't tie a specific revenue better or worse number to a ratio better or worse view. I hope that helps.\nOperator: The next question came from the line of Jeremy Sigee from BNP Paribas Exane.\nJeremy Sigee: I'll try to be quick. It's a couple of follow-ups on capital management. The first is on balance sheet, which often has grown seasonally in Q1. And with full year results, you said that again, you expected it to this year, but it hasn't. It shrunk slightly in Q1. And I just wondered how much of that was deliberate -- sort of deliberately steering the balance sheet smaller in a choppy environment versus kind of lack of opportunity to deploy? So that's my first question.  And then my second question really just on the capital surpluses, uses, et cetera. Is 13% CET1, or 13.2%, is that still the right reference level in a world where the market is nervous, not just the market, but the world more broadly is nervous around banks? And there's things like Basel IV to be funded, some banks are prefunding that, et cetera. So is 13% still the right reference level to be talking about for capital?\nJames von Moltke: Yes. Jeremy, look, I'll go in reverse order. Remember that in our capital plan, we will be building to Basel III final framework and in this plan, because of the model adjustments, higher LED floors and various items, that 13.2% has been getting steadily more conservative in how we're capitalizing our risks. So we do think it is appropriate to continue to target that level.  As you say, there will be a bubble in '24 that sort of goes away on 1st of January '25, all things equal that we need to build into our planning. But we feel comfortable with the buffer at 200 basis points above MDA. As I say, it's getting more conservative steadily.  On capital management and the deliberate nature, to be fair, it actually wasn't deliberate. Are we looking at risk appetite carefully and extensions of balance sheet in this environment, of course. But actually, the usual seasonality was a little bit less than we might otherwise have expected both on leverage exposure and RWA. And we do think loan growth is probably a little slower in the coming quarters than we might have expected given credit conditions, the possibility of recession, all the features in the environment today.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Piers Brown from HSBC.\nPiers Brown: Just a follow-up on funding, if I may. It's probably actually more a question for the fixed income call, but I'll ask it anyway. So you've given some very good transparency around deposit flows, pre and post the events in March. I wonder if you can just give any comment on what you're seeing in the wholesale funding markets? I think you were saying around the March events time that you had about 50% of the funding plan for this year done. Most of that was coming into senior nonpreferred and covered bonds. But have you been able to access the markets post those events? And are spreads getting to -- back to some sort of acceptable levels? And then if you've got any thoughts just on longer-term issues around AT1 and the viability of that market, that would be very helpful as well.\nJames von Moltke: Yes. Piers, happy to take it. Richard's with me in the room here, and we look forward to talking with our fixed income investors tomorrow, but nice to have fixed income topics on the equity call.  Look, we were -- we came into the year, as we mentioned, cautious about the environment. When we saw the market opening in the first few weeks of the year, we decided to move quickly, much quicker than our original funding plan might have suggested. And so we were pleased to have done all that, not just senior nonpreferred, by the way, but we did covered it, and we did a Tier 2 issue before the end of February. And we've done an AT1 deal late last year, which might look like expensive capital, but it gave us real comfort traveling into an uncertain '23 that we were making the right decisions for the bank.  We haven't really gone to the market since the turbulence started in any meaningful way. I think we may have done a covered bond in the interim. But the reason is not because we don't have access to it, but we don't like the price. And prefunding, therefore, was, I think, economically sensible and has actually given us, to the earlier question, from Chris, I think, has given us a slightly better funding profile than for this year and going into '24 than we might have other expected. Sorry, it was Adam's question, on the path of net interest income.  On AT1, we think the market healed more quickly than we might have expected after that Sunday. Look, the instrument sort of -- the instrument had challenges at inception as the market was being created. And I think it has now established a good convention with good investor understanding of what the various triggers and what have you are in it. And I think it will survive in this for. It's conceivably will be a little bit more expensive for banks to issue AT1 securities. But -- and I think it's worth a look at that, but our sense is that it will continue to be a viable instrument going forward.  For us, again, given we were conservative around our issuance -- we don't have a call date until 2025. And as I say, we're in a good place on our funding plan for this year. So we feel, overall, very constructive about where we see. As we stand, our hope and expectation is spreads will narrow again in the coming months.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jon Peace from Credit Suisse.\nKarl Peace: Just in the interest of time, maybe Christian, I could ask you a high-level question. What would be your view of how regulators respond to the liquidity concerns of March? And would you see a risk of higher for longer deposit guarantee fund contributions?\nChristian Sewing: Look, always hard to mention and think about what the potential reaction could be. But I think, first of all, in particular, the European regulators should also think back and look back at the March events and came that a lot of things they have done, we have done, have been right because the European banking system showed stability, resilience and I think credit to the regulators for that, what they have done. And if I think this is, for me, the #1 lesson learned.  And if you start from that, I think there is no reason to kind of now come up with whatever it's called, you call it, knee-jerk reaction to think about further rules. And to be very honest, I think the discussions we have also after these events are done in a very constructive way that everybody looks at potential loopholes still or weaknesses that is clear, and I think this should be done like we do it if there -- if something is happening on our side. But I can tell you that these discussions are really constructive, and I think the regulators, in particular, in Europe, should look back and saying, very stable system.  In this regard, I also do hope that from an SRF point of view, from a deposit scheme and from the single resolution fund that we don't see a different direction. And to be honest, I'm not hearing this. And again, one should also not only think about the single resolution fund, but also that we have national schemes, which worked in the past. And hence, I think, again, I see regulators, politicians being actually very calm, being very constructive. And I hope that is the case going forward. And hence, I'm calm on this.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citi.\nAndrew Coombs: One, if I could just come back to the LCR, but just very simple numbered questions. Related to TLTRO, you've obviously prepaid down. Can you tell us how much you've paid back? What are your outstanding balance is? And what the LCR would be on a pro forma basis ex the TLTRO? That's the first question.  Second question is on strength in the Corporate Ban. In particular, when you look at the strength of CTS and ICS, if you could break down how much of that is purely driven by rates versus how much is momentum on volumes and other initiatives that you're taking? I would love your thoughts there given the strength in that division this quarter.\nJames von Moltke: Andrew, on the LCR, I think maybe we'll come back tomorrow in the fixed income call. I think by memory, we paid down seven of the TLTRO. And that -- and what happens is TLTRO rolls into the LCR window over time. So it is still there. There's a nuance in it, which has to do with what collateral is posted in the TLTRO program versus unencumbered. So it is a support to the ratio. But one that we're -- we have a funding plan to wean ourselves off of over time. And it actually does give us some flexibility in how we manage collateral across the bank. . In CB, in round numbers, we were sort of flattish on fees and commission, a little bit up. Volumes were -- depending on whether you're looking year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter, flat to up slightly. So what you get is right now a significant impact of rates and within rates, the lag. Obviously, what we'd like to see is growth in both volumes and transactions, if you like, fee and commission, increasing as the lag effect begins to sort of run off.\nAndrew Coombs: And presumably, the guidance you gave in Q4 for the group where you talked about more significant deposit migration flowing through in 2024 versus 2023 would be very much the same for the Corporate Bank. So to some extent, you're expecting revenues to peak out this year and then stabilize.\nJames von Moltke: Yes. Although that's -- I think that's fair. The -- again, what we'll -- what remains to be seen is how the fee commission volume effect sort of offsets the runoff of the lag benefit and over what period of time. As I think we talked about in February, there's also a hedging benefit in time as certain hedges roll off, there is a step-up later in '24 from particularly dollar hedges rolling off. So there's still some sort of juice in the rate environment for CB as well. .\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Vishal Shah from Morgan Stanley.\nVishal Shah: I just have a few quick questions. One, can I go back to the CRE exposures. In your previous presentations, I also noted you have this additional EUR 15 billion in real estate exposure, which is recourse lending. Could you provide some clarity on the nature of that remaining portfolio.  Secondly, on the LTVs. Could you clarify these LTVs that you provided in the presentation are as of origination? Or are they your assumptions in terms of what they should look like now?  And then lastly on the deposits. Could you talk a bit about how the beta has been evolving between retail and corporates, a bit of color on the mix shift and also how is Deutsche Bank reacting to competition in terms of repricing?\nJames von Moltke: Sure. Happy to Vishal to answer the questions. So there's a lot in that sort of recourse lending portfolio. So there can be, for example, senior revolvers to real estate investment trusts. There can be sort of working capital. Sometimes construction lending to corporates that are recourse in nature, but where you have lean on property. There's a bunch of things there that -- also, by the way, wealth management, where you'd be lending to wealthy individuals who are investing in either their own businesses or in commercial real estate investments on their part.  So it's -- as a -- in terms of the nature or the riskiness if you like, and the underlying exposure, it is very different to the nonrecourse portfolio. And hence, our own sort of focus versus the rest portfolio distinction. And the losses in that -- in those portfolios have been negligible historically, just negligible.  On the LTVs, what we provide is the most recent. So our practice is to have external valuations no less frequently than once a year. Our internal views are updated no less frequently than every 6 months. So you do get, if not a real time. There is, of course, a little bit of a lag in that, but you get relatively speaking LTVs that adjust over time.  Your beta development question is an interesting one. We look at it both by currency and by portfolio. As you'd expect, the dollar has moved more quickly and I think is catching up with the models more quickly, getting, I would argue, close on the retail side to what we might have expected and closer on corporate. The euro is lagging that in both cases considerably based both on the recency of the rate increases. And I think just the nature and structure of the European deposit funding market. So the euro continues to outperform, again, across both portfolios.  And while that beta also has a little bit of a lag in it, looking at March right now, the turbulence the industry went through, I think it had an impact. But I wouldn't say it was a dramatic impact, at least in our estimation on that beta trajectory.\nOperator: Our last question is from the line of Andrew Lim from Societe Generale.\nAndrew Lim: Just a few quick fire questions. So firstly, you gave the percentage of deposits that are insured for your German retail deposit base. What does that look like on a group basis when you take into account the larger corporate deposits? And then secondly, for your group NIM, I guess that's 1.6% on an adjusted basis. How does your group -- how should that develop with respect to the hedge gains that you've also had in the coming quarters? And do you have an expectation for that group NIM and how that should develop going forward?  And then lastly, in a post trim world, why is Deutsche Bank having a 40 to 60 basis point hit on the CET1 ratio, largely due to a review of internal modeling?\nJames von Moltke: So Andrew, thank you for sticking with us. Sorry, the questions are coming so late in the call. The -- let me start with the NIM. I'm always a little bit cautious about predicting NIMs because there are so many moving parts in it. But in round numbers, if you take our guidance from the beginning of the year, which would have led you to kind of the mid-14s, maybe a little better and interest-earning assets of somewhere a little bit below EUR 1 trillion, you'd probably be in the 150 basis point range again, subject for the year, subject to some swings on the characterization that I mentioned. And we do provide, as always, the profitability by segment, including both net interest revenues and fair value through PT -- through profit and loss. So you see the total profitability, if you like, that the balance sheet produces with that.  In terms of the deposit base, the total deposit base, the numbers we gave you, I think, were 33% of the total deposit base under statutory insurance, 41% with -- if you exclude banks from that. I think your question maybe what is the German deposit base in total? Is that right? And that's a number we -- I don't have to hand. I'd have to get back to you on if that was the question you're after.\nAndrew Lim: Yes. No, it's a total group deposit base, but I can say...\nJames von Moltke: Total deposit base is 33% then and 41% if you include -- if you exclude banks from that ratio.\nAndrew Lim: Lastly, on the impact due to internal modeling, it's starting quite specific to Deutsche Bank. And I guess it's maybe surprising in the post trim world.\nJames von Moltke: Yes. I mean the post-TRIM world is really characterized by some of the EBA guidance that came out and the implementation of that. So it particularly relates to LGDs. To a lesser extent, some of the other factors. It's kind of been rolling through the portfolio. So we did see some in retail last year and as we've talked about more next year. So it hasn't been uniquely to either the Investment Bank or the Corporate Bank, but it's gone portfolio by portfolio. . There will be some implementation of new models in the aftermath of our Unity technology implementation. They're just -- there's a dependency there. So there will be some adjustments in the models that are implemented then in Q3 also on the PB side, on the Private Bank side. And my -- I believe that by the end of the year then, we will have been through the reviews that we need to with the ECB and implemented what there is to do. '24 should be a cleaner year and give us the ability to prepare then for Basel III final framework implementation on the 1st of January '25.\nOperator: So this concludes our Q&A session, and I hand back to Zike.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you very much for your questions.

        "text": "Thank you, , and welcome from me, too. It's a pleasure to discuss our first quarter 2023 results with you today, and we are pleased with the progress we continue to make towards our 2025 goals. The first quarter was marked by turbulent conditions in the banking sector, particularly in March in addition to the macroeconomic challenges. However, our transformation has provided us with strong foundations, which enabled us to navigate these challenges successfully.  We delivered on four critical --. First, profitability. Pretax profits increased by 12% to EUR 1.9 billion and post-tax profit by 8% to EUR 1.3 billion which on both counts, represents our strongest quarter since 2013. Our cost-to-income ratio was 71% this quarter, 2 percentage points better than the prior year, driven by positive operating leverage. We also generated an 8.3% post-tax return on tangible equity in this period.  As you know, annual bank levies are recognized in the first quarter. Spreading these bank levies equally across the four quarters of the year, our first quarter cost income ratio would be 67% with a post-tax return on tangible equity of 10%, putting us well on track to our 2025 targets.  Second, we proved the strength of our franchise. Our business model is focused on four client-centric businesses, which complement each other and provide a well diversified earnings mix as this quarter shows. We delivered revenues of EUR 7.7 billion, up 5% over the prior year quarter.  Third, we again proved our resilience. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 30.6%, up from 13.4% in the previous quarter and 12.8% in the first quarter of last year. Our liquidity reserves were EUR 241 billion, and our liquidity coverage ratio rose to 143%.  Finally, sustainability is an important part of our strategy. As you heard at our sustainability deep dive in March, we have updated our business strategies and policies, expanded on our commitments in several ways to fight climate change, namely our thermal coal policy and our ambition is to encourage our corporate clients to commit to net zero. This quarter, we made further progress towards our target of EUR 500 billion of sustainable financing and investments, excluding DWS by end 2025. Our cumulative volume since January 2020 has grown to EUR 238 billion.  Let me now turn to Slide 2 to discuss the strong performance across our divisions this quarter. We saw good momentum across all business and delivered on the strategic steps, which support our 2025 targets and strengthen our global house bank model.  The Corporate Bank showed financial strength with record revenues and good client activity across our main businesses. I'm pleased that we are winning mandates with top clients to support working capital and their global value chain.  In the Investment Bank, we added talent to support growth, and we are expanding our core franchise. We increased our global market share by more than 40 basis points compared to the previous quarters in Origination & Advisory and achieved year-on-year revenue growth in rates for the fifth consecutive quarter. This reflects our ongoing investments, especially in capital-light business areas.  The Private Bank produced its best ever operating revenues, grew assets under management and captured net inflows. We also successfully completed the next wave of the Postbank IT migration at the beginning of April, transferring over 6.5 million contracts from 5 million Postbank clients. This will unlock the EUR 300 million of cost efficiencies as we previously communicated.  Asset Management saw inflows of EUR 6 billion and EUR 9 billion, excluding cash, despite turbulent markets. Stefan Hoops is progressing with the strategy by investing into transformation to create a stand-alone platform while expanding the product offering. launched the largest ETF of all time in the U.S. of approximately USD 2 billion. This is also the single largest climate investing ETF launch.  Turning now to the big provision profit on Slide 3. Preprovision profit for the group was EUR 2.2 billion in the first quarter, up 14% compared to the prior year period. We again achieved positive operating leverage as we grew our revenues and controlled expenses. This quarter underlines how complementary our businesses are and how our strategic transformation has helped us to rebalance our income strength.  I'm particularly pleased with the performance at the Corporate Bank and Private Bank, which benefited from the normalized rate environment. The contribution from the Corporate Bank and the Private Bank to preprovision profit increased to almost 60% from 33% compared with last year. The Investment Bank also produced a solid underlying contribution against an exceptionally strong prior year quarter.  The rebalancing towards our stable revenue businesses is especially visible when looking at their contribution to the total group's preprovision profit on a last 12 months basis. The Corporate Bank and Private Bank alone have contributed 70% over this period. You will recall that our corporate and other results were negatively impacted by valuation timing in the prior year quarter. We anticipated that this would reverse over time, and we are benefiting from this effect this quarter.  The momentum and balance we see across our four businesses gives us confidence we have the right business model and a strong platform to further improve returns.  In addition to our growth focus, we maintained our discipline on cost as we continue to invest in technology and controls and face inflationary pressures. In February, we said that we were working on additional efficiency measures, which we are now implementing and which are shown on Slide 4. The changes we announced to the Management Board yesterday should support this agenda. The creation of a group Chief Operating Officer will help us to deliver our strategic transformation agenda and drive inefficiencies out of the bank.  We also focus on rightsizing our nonclient-facing functions. During the second quarter, we will begin to reduce our senior nonclient-facing workforce by 5% and we'll limit new hiring without compromising our controls.  We continue to align our German Private Bank to the current trends and market environment, including actions to streamline our mortgage platform. In addition, we are working on a series of productivity measures including sophisticated capacity planning in several areas, including anti-financial crime. Our target is to increase returns over time, and we continue to look for more opportunities to deliver on this. I will speak about this later.  Let me now turn to our balance sheet strength and resilient funding profile on Slide 5. Once again, we benefited from disciplined risk management in our strong and stable balance sheet. Our loan book is well diversified across businesses and regions. Around 70% of the book is secured or hedged and almost 80% of our loan portfolio is in stable and mostly lower-risk businesses in the Private Bank and Corporate Bank. Nearly half of our book is based in Germany, and 40% is equally distributed across EMEA and North America with the remainder in APAC.  Our deposit base funds about 60% of the net balance sheet and our loan-to-deposit ratio was 82% at quarter end. Over 80% of our deposits are from most stable client segments such as retail, corporate small- and medium-sized enterprises or severance where we have long-standing and deep-rooted client relationships. 77% of our German retail deposits are insured by the statutory protection scheme. In the Corporate Bank, close to 3/4 of all deposits are sticky operational and term deposits supporting our clients' daily needs. James will say more on deposits later.  Our CET1 ratio strengthened to 13.6%, 250 basis points above the MDA buffer and our highest level for 2 years. Our leverage ratio was 4.6%.  As I said, our liquidity metrics remained sound. The LCR was 143%, above our target of around 130% with a buffer of EUR 63 billion above regulatory required levels. The net stable funding ratio was 120% at the high end of the group's target range of 115% to 120% and EUR 100 billion above required levels.  To summarize, we have solid foundations to navigate through the recent turbulent environment. And importantly, I view the European banking sector as stable, thanks in part to the regulatory efforts of recent years.  Moving to Slide 6. The current environment underlines the importance of our global house bank model, which positions us well to serve clients in volatile markets. When we set out our strategy in March last year, we outlined the key themes which underpin these goals and ambitions. And these themes have become even more important in light of the geopolitical and macroeconomic upheavals since then.  Our first quarter results demonstrate the progress we are making on the path towards our 2025 goals, benefiting from a strategy and business model, which are well aligned to market trends. We will leverage the more favorable interest rate environment, deploy our risk management expertise to support clients and -- capital to high-return growth opportunities.  With sustainability being so important, we will deepen our dialogue with and support for clients, expand our product range and broaden our agenda for our own operations. We will also continue to benefit from the investments we are making in technology together with our strategic partners. The investments should accelerate our transition to a digital bank and the benefits should be seen our efficiency and controls. These technology investments are also designed to create value for our clients.  We believe we have the right strategy and the right focus on clients, which allow us to accelerate execution of our strategy, enhance our franchise and drive returns. We see these opportunities on three dimensions, which we detail on Slide 7. We have committed to self-fund our investments and increase operating leverage through efficiencies and we now see additional scope to do that. We already indicated that we aim to deliver incremental operational efficiencies greater than the EUR 2 billion identified at the 2022 Investor Deep Dive.  As discussed, we are in the process of identifying and executing on a further EUR 500 million of benefits, which we will work to extract. The incremental benefits will come from a strategic review of our entire workforce, further optimizing the distribution networks in the Private Bank. We also expect to see benefits in operations and process automation, and we are excited about the opportunities that should emerge from artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Second, we are focusing on capital efficiency. Deploying capital to increase shareholder value has always been our priority, and we see opportunities to reallocate capital. We aim to free up EUR 15 billion to EUR 20 billion of risk-weighted assets from reduction in certain sub hurdle lending and mortgage portfolios, greater utilization of securitization and hedging optimization. These actions are expected to have a minimal impact on revenues but will enable us to increase returns and reallocate resources to more capital-accretive businesses.  We believe that the combination of cost and capital efficiency, together with additional opportunities across markets should position us to outperform our existing growth objectives. To support this, we continue to invest into our platforms and to take opportunities created by current market conditions to attract talent to strengthen advisory capabilities in various business and regions including Asia. We expect these actions to accelerate the execution of our strategy and more importantly, increase returns to shareholders over time.  Before I hand over to James, let me summarize our progress on Slide 8. Our performance in the first quarter demonstrates the strength of Deutsche Bank's franchise, earnings power and balance sheet. Our transformation has given us a strong platform for growth with a diverse business model, providing well-balanced earnings. This provides a strong step-up to accelerate our global house bank ambition through additional actions on the three dimensions we just discussed.  We remain fully committed to our capital distribution plan. With the successful first quarter behind us and strong capital, we have now initiated the dialogue with the supervisors about share buybacks, which are expected to take place in the second half of this year. This is in line with the promise we made last quarter that we initiate the step once we have greater clarity on a number of issues, including the macro environment.  Everything we have seen this quarter supports our view that we are on the right path. The group is well positioned to capitalize on current trends to drive returns above the cost of equity.  With that, let me hand over to James."

        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Thank you, Christian. Let me start with a few key performance indicators in the first quarter on Slide 10 and put them in the context of our 2025 targets. We have strong revenue momentum. A balanced business mix enables us to benefit from higher interest rates despite challenging financial markets, delivering revenue growth above our 2025 targeted compound annual growth rate on a last 12-month basis. Our post-tax return on tangible equity was 8.3% in the first quarter or 10% prorating bank levies through the year, already in line with our 2025 target. We've made steady progress on our cost income ratio, which was 71% in the quarter, a 4 percentage point improvement on full year 2022.  If the bank levies were prorated across the year, the cost/income ratio would be 67%. The first quarter performance shows clear progress toward our 2025 target of less than 62.5%. And we demonstrated the strength of our capital and balance sheet and the quality of our loan book in challenging conditions. Our capital ratio was 13.6% in the first quarter in line with our 2025 target of around 13%.  With that, let me turn to the first quarter highlights on Slide 11. Group revenues were EUR 7.7 billion, up 5% on the first quarter of 2022 and with a better balance across our businesses. Noninterest expenses were EUR 5.5 billion and adjusted costs of EUR 5.4 billion were essentially flat year-on-year. We booked bank levies of EUR 473 million this quarter, down 35% year-on-year as a result of a reduction in the sector-wide single resolution fund assessment as well as our improved relative sector contribution and an increased use of the revocable commitments. Our provision for credit losses was EUR 372 million or 30 basis points of average loans. Overall, credit losses remained well contained despite a small number of idiosyncratic events.  We generated a profit before tax of EUR 1.9 billion, up 12% and net profit of EUR 1.3 billion, up 8% compared to the prior year quarter. Our cost-income ratio came in at 71%, down 2 percentage points versus the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share was EUR 0.61 in the first quarter with an effective tax rate of 29%. Tangible book value per share was EUR 27.28, up 2% on the fourth quarter of 2022 and up 8% year-on-year.  Now let me turn to some of the drivers of these results, starting with our NIM development on Slide 12. We have continued to benefit from the interest rate environment in the first quarter, as demonstrated by the rise in net interest margin in the Corporate Bank and Private Bank. Group NIM, however, declined due to the accounting treatment of some of our central hedges and balance sheet management activities. This quarter, the accounting effect resulted in a sequential impact on group NIM of around negative 20 basis points. This effect is held in C&O, where it is fully offset by an increase in noninterest revenue, and there is no economic loss to the firm or overall impact on group P&L.  Realized deposit betas remained favorable when compared to our models, but we expect this to partially normalize in the coming quarters as the pace of interest rate rises slow. Average interest-earning assets declined modestly, driven mainly by our TLTRO payments.  With that, let's turn to costs on Slide 13. Adjusted costs, excluding bank levies of EUR 4.9 billion were flat sequentially, but increased by 5% year-on-year or EUR 240 million. This reflected cumulative investments over the past 12 months in technology, controls and people, together with higher business activity and inflationary pressures. The monthly average run rate of around EUR 1.63 billion is in line with our prior guidance, and we expect to operate at the run rate of between EUR 1.6 billion and EUR 1.65 billion per month for the rest of the year.  Looking at the individual components. Compensation and benefits costs were essentially flat as increased fixed remuneration was offset by lower variable remuneration. Ongoing workforce optimization limited the impact of higher headcount. IT costs were up EUR 66 million or 8% year-on-year, reflecting continued investments in technology and innovation. Professional services increased by EUR 25 million, driven by business consulting and legal fees. And the increase of around EUR 100 million in other costs mainly reflects increasing expenses for banking services and outsourced operations. We also saw a normalization of travel and marketing expenses.  Let's now turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 14. Provision for credit losses for the first quarter was 30 basis points of average loans or EUR 372 million. Stage 3 provisions increased to EUR 397 million compared to EUR 114 million in the prior year quarter. The majority of this increase was driven by the Private Bank and included a small number of idiosyncratic events in the International Private Bank. This was partly offset by a release of EUR 26 million in Stages 1 and 2 provisions, partially driven by a slight improvement in the macroeconomic outlook since the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to a charge of EUR 178 million in the prior year quarter. We did not see a wider deterioration in the portfolio outside of this small number of specific events, and overall credit quality remains high. For the full year 2023, we reaffirm our previous guidance range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans.  Let me also cover our commercial real estate portfolio on Slide 15. Our EUR 33 billion commercial real estate focused portfolio represents 7% of our loan book. And as you know, it consists of nonrecourse lending within the core CRE business units in the Investment Bank and the Corporate Bank. As a reminder, we have provided disclosure on this focused portfolio since the COVID crisis.  The portfolio is well diversified across regions and property types. Despite the headwinds facing the sector, we are comfortable with our exposure for several reasons. First, our loan originations are focused on larger institutional quality assets in more liquid primary markets and with strong institutional sponsorship.  Second, the moderate weighted average LTVs, or loan-to-value, of 62% in the Investment Bank and 53% in the Corporate Bank provide material cushion against the expected decline of collateral values. Our sponsors typically have significant skin in the game in the form of cash equity invested in their properties and have invested more equity where needed to ensure the ongoing performance of their assets. However, we recognize the market is under pressure, especially in the U.S. where lending markets have tightened with further uncertainty caused by recent turmoil in the regional banking sector. The U.S. office sector is also facing greater pressure as the office vacancy rate is approaching 20% compared to approximately 7% in Europe.  Our exposure in the U.S. office sector is manageable at EUR 4.5 billion, less than 1% of our total book. Our office portfolio is high quality with around 80% in Class A properties and we have institutional sponsorship in major markets. The loans are primarily backed by multi-tenant properties in large urban markets and again, with high-quality sponsors. The portfolio has an average LTV of around 64% with a weighted average lease term of 6.7 years, which provides relative stability of cash flows. At the same time, only approximately EUR 600 million of exposure has final maturities over the course of the year, which limits the refinancing risk in a higher rate environment.  In the first quarter, provisions related to U.S. office were EUR 60 million or just 4% of the first quarter Stage 3 provisions, which shows the relative resiliency and quality of this book.  Moving to funding and liquidity on Slide 16. We ended the quarter with a liquidity coverage ratio of 143% equivalent to an excess of EUR 63 billion above our regulatory requirements. Over time, as market conditions improve, we would look to prudently steer our LCR down towards our 130% target.  As Christian outlined, we have a well-diversified deposit base across client segments and regions. Our deposit base of EUR 592 billion declined by 5% sequentially or 4% on an FX-adjusted basis, year-on-year. The decline in part reflected a normalization from the elevated levels seen in the second half of last year and was broadly in line with the market. About 1/3 of the reduction in balances came at the end of the quarter as certain clients reposition parts of their exposures. This constitutes about 1% of our overall deposit portfolio and speaks to the underlying quality of our book.  Deposits in the Corporate Bank declined by 7% sequentially or 6% if adjusted for FX, mostly due to normalizations from elevated levels in the last 2 quarters as well as increased pricing competition. Private Bank deposits declined by 2% in the quarter. Approximately 30% of flows migrated into higher-yielding investment products in the Private Bank, while the remainder reflected the ongoing inflationary pressures and increasing price competition.  Before we move to performance in our businesses, let me turn to capital on Slide 17. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio came in at 13.6%, up by 25 basis points compared to the previous quarter. Net capital build was 30 basis points reflecting our strong organic capital generation from net income, partially offset by higher equity compensation awards. Risk-weighted assets grew modestly, reducing the CET1 ratio by only 6 basis points. Credit risk-weighted assets increased primarily due to seasonal loan growth in the Investment Bank and Corporate Bank. Market risk RWA declined slightly following ECB approved reduction in our qualitative multiplier add-on.  The leverage ratio was 4.6% at quarter end, up 6 basis points on the previous quarter, mainly due to higher retained earnings. And finally, we continue to operate with loss-absorbing capacity well above our requirements. Our MREL surplus as our most binding constraint has increased by EUR 1 billion to EUR 19 billion over the quarter.  Moving to the Corporate Bank on Slide 19. Corporate Bank revenues in the first quarter of EUR 2 billion were 35% higher year-on-year, driven by increased interest rates and continued pricing discipline. This was the highest quarterly revenue performance since the formation of the Corporate Bank, driven by revenue growth across all regions and business units. However, as we highlighted at our fourth quarter results, we expect a normalization of our interest revenues in the second half of the year. Our first quarter results were supported by still very benign pass-through rates, which we believe marks the peak revenue impact of this pricing dynamic.  Momentum was particularly strong in cash management with corporate, institutional and business banking clients as well as in Corporate Trust. Loan volume in the Corporate Bank was EUR 121 billion, down by EUR 4 billion compared to the prior year quarter and flat sequentially. Deposits were EUR 269 billion, essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter, but down 7% from elevated prior quarter levels, as I have just outlined.  Credit loss provisions remained contained despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment and were primarily driven by one larger Stage 3 event, which was offset in revenues by insurance recoveries. Credit loss provisions remained well below the prior year quarter, which was impacted by the start of the war in Ukraine.  Noninterest expenses were EUR 1.1 billion, an increase of 2% year-on-year, driven by higher internal service cost allocations, partly offset by a lower bank levy contribution. Profit before tax was EUR 822 million in the quarter, more than triple the prior year quarter. The cost income ratio improved to 55% and post-tax return on tangible equity was 18.3% despite the recognition of bank levies.  I'll now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 20. Revenues for the first quarter were 19% lower year-on-year. Revenues in fixed sales and trading decreased by 17% in the first quarter compared to a prior year, which included approximately EUR 500 million of episodic items. Client flows were robust with institutional activity broadly flat year-on-year and underlying business performance strong despite the extreme market volatility in March.  Rates revenues were higher compared to a very strong prior year quarter, reflecting improvements across the platform and effective risk management. Credit trading, financing and emerging markets revenues were lower, principally reflecting the absence of episodic items in the prior year period, while underlying performance improved. Foreign exchange revenues were significantly lower compared to a strong prior year period, driven by the impact of extreme interest rate volatility and market dislocation during March.  Moving to origination and advisory. Revenues were down 31% in a market which remained challenging. Our performance was in line with the industry fee pool and reflected a market share recovery and a shift in the underlying product mix compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Debt origination revenues were significantly lower. Volumes remain low in leveraged loans, although the market did start to see a partial recovery in high yield. Investment-grade debt revenues also declined as did the industry fee pool. Equity origination revenues were down in a challenging market with limited issuance. Revenues in advisory were significantly lower, though by less than the industry fee pool decline.  Turning to costs. Both noninterest expenses and adjusted costs were essentially flat versus the prior year as reduced bank levies were largely offset by investments in technology and our control functions. Loan balances increased year-on-year, driven by higher originations primarily in the financing businesses. Quarter-on-quarter balances were essentially flat with lower origination reflecting our selective risk deployment. Provision for credit losses was EUR 41 million, 16 basis points of average loans, a slight increase on the prior year. Profit before tax was EUR 861 million in the quarter.  Turning to the Private Bank on Slide 21. Private Bank revenues were EUR 2.4 billion in the first quarter, up 10% year-on-year and marked the highest quarterly revenues since the beginning of our transformation of the Private Bank, excluding specific revenue items. Revenues in the Private Bank Germany increased by 14% to EUR 1.6 billion. Higher net interest income from deposits more than compensated for a decline in fee income, which reflected changes in contractual and regulatory conditions, market uncertainty and to a lesser extent, lower client activity.  In the International Private Bank, revenues were up 3%. Revenues in Wealth Management and bank for entrepreneurs were up 4% or 7% if adjusted for the impact of the sale of our Financial Advisors business in Italy. Revenues in premium banking declined by 1%.  Noninterest expenses were up 10%, partly due to the nonrecurrence of releases of restructuring provisions, which benefited the prior year quarter. Adjusted costs increased by 5% year-on-year due to higher internal service cost allocations, higher investment spending, including costs related to the Postbank IT migration and inflation impacts, partly offset by lower bank levies and savings from transformation initiatives.  Net inflows were EUR 6 billion in the quarter, driven by growth in investment products in both Germany and the International Private Bank. Provision for credit losses was EUR 267 million, up from EUR 101 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven mainly by a small number of single name losses in the International Private Bank. Excluding these items, the development of the portfolio continued to reflect the high quality of the loan book and continued risk discipline.  Profit before tax was EUR 280 million in the quarter, including the full year impact of bank levy charges. Cost-to-income ratio was 78% in the quarter with a post-tax return on tangible equity of 5%.  Let me continue with Asset Management on Slide 22. My usual reminder, the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. As you will have seen in their materials, DWS reported a decline in performance compared to the prior year, reflecting lower market levels. Sequentially, assets under management increased to EUR 841 billion, reflecting EUR 19 billion of market appreciation and net inflows. Inflows excluding cash, were nearly EUR 9 billion primarily in passive and multi-asset. Flows in cash products were very volatile throughout the quarter, ending with net outflows of EUR 3 billion.  Revenues declined by 14% versus the prior year quarter. This was predominantly driven by an 8% decline in management fees to EUR 571 million, which reflected financial market performance during 2022. Performance and transaction fees were also lower year-on-year from performance fee recognition and lower real estate transaction fees. Other revenues declined on lower gains from co-investments and a smaller benefit from fair value of guarantees.  Noninterest expenses and adjusted costs increased by 3% and 1%, respectively. Profit before tax of EUR 115 million in the quarter was down 44% compared to prior year. The cost income ratio for the quarter was 74%. And return on tangible equity was 14%.  Moving to Corporate & Other on Slide 23. A reminder that Corporate & Other now includes the impact of our legacy portfolios previously reported as the Capital Release Unit. Corporate & Other reported a pretax loss of EUR 226 million this quarter, a significant improvement from the pretax loss of EUR 677 million in the first quarter of 2022. The year-on-year improvement was principally driven by valuation and timing differences, which were positive EUR 239 million in this quarter compared to negative EUR 184 million in the prior year quarter.  The pretax loss associated with our legacy portfolios was EUR 130 million, an improvement of EUR 166 million year-on-year, primarily driven by lower expenses. Excluding bank levies, adjusted costs associated with these portfolios approximately halved to EUR 66 million.  Funding and liquidity impacts were negative EUR 106 million in the current quarter versus negative EUR 127 million in the prior year quarter. Expenses associated with shareholder activities not allocated to the business divisions as defined in the OECD transfer pricing guidelines were EUR 124 million in this quarter, essentially flat year-on-year. The reversal of noncontrolling interests in the operating businesses, primarily from DWS was positive EUR 37 million down from EUR 56 million in the prior year quarter. Other impacts reported in the segment aggregated to negative EUR 142 billion.  Risk-weighted assets stood at EUR 43 billion at the end of the first quarter, including EUR 19 billion of operational risk RWA, representing a EUR 3 billion reduction since the fourth quarter of 2022.  Turning to the group outlook for 2023 on Slide 24. We remain focused on delivering positive operating leverage. We expect 2023 revenues around the midpoint of a range between EUR 28 billion and EUR 29 billion. We expect to keep our noninterest expenses broadly flat to 2022. As confirmed earlier, we expect the monthly run rate of adjusted costs, excluding bank levies to be about EUR 1.6 billion to EUR 1.65 billion for the rest of the year.  To deliver on the cost reduction measures, which Christian outlined, we now expect to record restructuring and severance provisions of approximately EUR 500 million in 2023. In line with our previous guidance, provision for credit losses is expected in the range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans.  Christian mentioned our commitment to capital distributions. Consistent with our path laid out at the Investor Deep Dive last year, we have proposed a cash dividend of EUR 0.30 per share for approval at the AGM in May, and the dialogue with supervisors about share buybacks in the second half of the year has been initiated. We are also committed to maintaining a strong capital position and a solid liquidity and funding base, all of which we demonstrated during turbulent conditions in the first quarter.  With that, let me hand back to , and we look forward to your questions."

        "speaker": "Chris Hallam",
        "text": "So my first question relates to capital return. Clearly, profitability and capital formation was better than expected in the first quarter. Previously, you've commented that the timing and size of potential share buybacks here would be dependent on getting clarity on the size of regulatory model headwinds and the macro outlook. And today, you've said that you've initiated dialogue with the ECB. So what updates do you have on those headwinds? How comfortable do you feel on the macro backdrop? And how far are you with the ECB discussions? And what does that all mean for the potential timing and size of share buybacks this year? That's the first question.  And then secondly, perhaps to Christian, coming back to Slide 7. If we look across those three pillars, cost, capital and revenues, could you talk a little bit about what these measures really mean incrementally to the 2025 strategy and targets? What are the key timing points regarding progress in those areas? And are you in a position to upgrade any of those targets at this point?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Chris, it's Christian. Thank you very much for your question. And I'm sure James will jump in. I'm going after both questions, and again, James will contribute.  Look, on your first question, I think it was very important for us, for the Management Board here and for James and myself that we wanted to see the first quarter development. And indeed, this development is not only important but gives us all the confidence and all the tailwind we need when it comes to the further trajectory of our results.  And you really look at the composition of our results. That's what makes me so positive and confident that is the stable business development in the Private Bank and in the Corporate Bank. And if you then think about that what James already outlined in the previous calls and what we always refer to that kind of the real tailwind in the interest rates is coming in the Private Bank only in the outer years in '24 and '25. With the momentum we see right now already in the stable business, that was obviously the right starting point now to change gears and to initiate the discussions on the share buybacks with the ECB.  Secondly, to take a step back, I think also in the aftermath, it was right actually not to do this end of January because we said on purpose, we would like to have a better view on the economic development, the volatility in the market, the turbulences we see. And look, we did not know what happened in March, but you could see that also the way we handled that situation. Again, the stability now with a step up of 13.6%, not even talking about the strong liquidity number of 143%, all gives us now the confidence to say this is the right moment to start.  Thirdly, I do believe that the environment, the economic outlook for Europe, particular for Germany, you may have seen the guidance of the German Economic Minister yesterday that -- and we agree to that, we don't see a recession in Germany coming in '23. It's slow growth, a minimal growth but actually far better than that what we thought could happen at the end of 2022 for the year '23. Also there, clearly better visibility when it comes to the economic outlook.  And James will give you more details when it comes to the model changes, but also there, we did a lot of progress and have far better visibility, what it means. And in this regard, we concluded based on this, in our view, really good number -- quarter 1 numbers that it's now time to approach the discussions, initiate the discussions with regard to timing.  In line with that, what I said on February 2, we believe that the share buybacks will happen in the second half of 2023. There, I used the word optimistic. Now I use the word that I'm very confident that this will happen in the second half of '23.  And with regard to the amount, look, I think we need to have the discussions with the ECB. But James and I are both believe in consistency. If you think about the kind of the increase in the dividends, which we proposed for the year '22 versus the previous year, I think for consistent reasons, we should also think about such an increase when it comes to share buybacks.  James, potentially, you step in on the model before I take the second question."

        "text": "Sure. Happy to do that. So Chris, remember in the February call, we were talking about the model impacts. There are a number of different items, one big one, which is what we call the wholesale model review but then many other items, some of which are netting. And so there is a range of outcomes. But at this point, with better visibility into the discussions, we'd probably say that range is between 40 and 60 basis points of capital.  If you take the midpoint of that, which is a pretty good place to be for modeling purposes, that 50 basis points actually represents about the capital -- the organic capital generation that consensus would suggest we earn in the balance of the year. Now obviously, we'd like to do better than that. But if you use that, essentially, earnings for the rest of the year would offset the model impact. And that leaves us sort of the gap to 13.2 to fund growth, a buyback and any other events during the year, uncertainties in the first two numbers, which we feel pretty good about. And to give you a sense that, therefore, the range of outcomes that Christian refers to, we think at this point is affordable based on the information we have."

        "text": "To your second question, and Page 7, look, again, first of all, I really would like to say it is nothing else Chris, than the continuous development of our strategy and the confirmation of the strategy and the trajectory which we have taken over the last years. But of course, when you are in the middle of that, you see the client reaction, you see the momentum I was just talking about before also in the stable business. the foundation and the resilience, which we have found in the Investment Bank, and obviously, you always reconsider what else can we do.  And let me start on the business side. So on the right-hand side of the slide. Number one, yes, momentum in the business is so important because it goes back to something which I always try to outline in this call and which I think sometimes gets still underestimated, but that is all about our people. If they see these results, when you think about the momentum, the passion, the spirit in this bank, you can see that, in particular now in the Corporate and the Private Bank, it goes only into one direction, and that's what we want to build on. We see growth rates, which are higher than that what we initially planned.  Now then there are market opportunities. Also, as a result of the events which we have seen in our competitive environment also here in Europe, which obviously we would like to bank on. And you have seen the one or the other announcement over the last weeks that we will start to do some selective hiring. Very important either in the Corporate Bank platform or in capital-light businesses like the advisory piece. You also see that we are actually focusing on additional markets. We have hired a team for Latin America in the O&A and financing business, which is important for us because a lot of German clients, corporate clients are actually there who want to have our help. So market opportunities are there.  And all that gives us actually the opportunity again, with the momentum we see also when I look forward, and obviously, with the tailwind of the interest rates that we think the revenue growth numbers which we put forward are not only achievable, but we have a real chance to outperform that.  Now secondly, obviously, on the cost management side, if you work on those EUR 2 billion, which we always laid out and where we gave details in last year's IDD, and we always reconfirm the numbers, you then go deeper, you see there is more room. And therefore, we also changed the governance in the Management Board. We have a clear allocation of cost management now in the management board, front to back, which will create further opportunities. And I think we also don't only think about long-term or more long-term cost changes, but the reduction in force exercise which we kicked off in March, which will be actually then fully implemented in Q2 is something which shows you that we see now with all that what has happened with the sharpening of our businesses, but also implementation of front-to-end processes that we have more potential than we saw before. And hence, we believe that the additional EUR 500 million is the target and a goal which we should achieve.  And thirdly, capital efficiency. And to be honest, to criticize ourselves, I think we have done a very good capital management. But when it comes to capital efficiency in each and every sub businesses, we can further step up. And what I like about this exercise, which we, in our view, bring approximately EUR 15 billion to EUR 20 billion of risk-weighted assets over the next couple of years in risk-weighted asset reductions while not losing revenues over that is actually a more disciplined capital allocation. And that is on 2 or 3 items.  Number one, yes, we will act on items which we see, for instance, in the German mortgage business. If the countercyclical capital buffer has been increased like it was, we obviously will act and will move capital out of this business and either shift it to higher rewarding businesses or we give it back to the shareholders. Secondly, we have found ways to increase hedging securitizations. And thirdly, discipline is not only on the cost side. It's in particular on the review of each and every individual reward when it comes to lending. And there, we need to step up.  And I think that there are areas in our banks, also in the Corporate Bank, where we can do better when it comes to risk reward, that will be implemented. James will be all over about it. And those three items on top of that, what we have seen in Q1, and I really would like to focus on that again. It's an 8.3% return on equity. But if you , so to say, the SRF, we are at 10%. We know exactly what happens with the SRF payments. It will go down. And we still have something in plan for '24 and '25, but it will go down.  So the 10% RoTE in the first quarter is a really good guidance because the first quarter is not an outlier quarter. If you now think about these three items, obviously, it is our target to outperform that in '25. And this is the confidence we have. And with all that, what we really see in numbers in the first quarter was the whole trajectory, I'm really excited about that way and hence, very positive that we can achieve that outperformance. James, I don't know whether you..."

But could you just give us a sense of how that evolved throughout the quarter, particularly in and around that market period? And maybe further out, what are you seeing quarter-to-date? And how do you see those deposit trends developing throughout the year? Secondly, you're sticking to your revenue guidance. I'm just wondering what gives you the confidence that target still holds, given the miss in trading, given what we're seeing quarter-to-date there? So maybe you could just provide a little bit an update by division, quarter-to-date dynamics, that would be helpful.  And one final quick one. I'm interested in your discussions with regulators around the CVS issues and the wider banking crisis. Do you envisage any change coming maybe through things like liquidity coverage ratio, definition changes or some sort of additional levies to ensure a wider scope for deposits? Any sense where you see change would be great."

        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Sure. Thanks, Tom. It's James. I'll start. Maybe I'll start where you finished, and we'll come back to that with the liquidity metrics because we manage to the liquidity metrics rather than do absolute levels of deposits or funding, and I think it's important to emphasize we were able to travel through a difficult quarter and especially March, while maintaining and, in fact, improving both ratios -- liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio. And so it's important to understand what that means.  We ended the quarter in as good or better position to withstand a 30-day or a 1-year stress environment than we were at year-end based on that strong deposit base as well as the secured and unsecured funding position we are in. And we think that's a significant achievement for Deutsche Bank but also for the industry. I'll talk about this when we go to your third question, but I think LCR and these other tools have withstood the test in the month of March.  Turning to deposits. You mentioned the reduction in the deposits over the course of the quarter. The average deposits were down a little less than 2% over the quarter. And as you've seen, the spot level was down 4%, excluding FX. And that, as we look at sort of banks that have reported so far, we think is -- and some market -- sort of industry data through February is reasonably in line with what you've seen on both sides of the Atlantic so far.  Now as we've talked about, there's a lot going on in the deposit books. Normalization in our case, from very high levels of deposits that we finished the year with. There was sort of a run-up in December, which is one of the reasons for the variance between the average and the spot. You've also seen a pickup in competition for liquidity as central banks did drained liquidity from the market and you do see some price-sensitive deposits leaving the bank. We're just disciplined on pricing. And so that represents, if you like, a strategy outcome.  We have seen clients shift deposits to higher-yielding investment alternatives, including but not limited to money market funds. And some of that, as we've pointed out, within our own system. So it didn't leave the bank. It just went from deposits to other products.  The other thing that happens in our deposit base is sort of usual ebbs and flows. So if you're a very large cash management bank for corporates and institutionals, there's a lot of movement throughout the quarter which means that your specific question is a little bit hard to pinpoint. But I would -- and what we've talked about is sort of 2/3 coming in the first, say, 9 or 10 weeks of the quarter and then 1/3 in the last 2 weeks, including the sort of episodic or idiosyncratic noise around our name. We think that 1% or 1.5%, which is what we'd estimate over those last 7 or 8 sort of business days of the quarter actually underscores the resilience of the deposit base and the relative absence of what I'll call hot money at DB.  Where did you see it? It was in the portfolios that are typically the most price sensitive and sensitive, if you like, to sentiment. So in a sense, it's not surprising to see that amount of reduction. And as we come back to your LCR question, I think it proves its value as a tool because the reality, why did the ratio stay constant, we don't apply liquidity value to the -- those funding sources, including deposits that are most likely to flow out in a stress scenario.  So if I put that all together, Tom, we feel pretty good about the experience and the way we were able to manage through that environment. And credit to the teams. The communication, the client outreach and engagement, the work that was done in preparation, we feel quite good about performance through that period."

        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Some to the other question on the revenue guidance, high confidence in the midpoint of EUR 28 billion to EUR 29 billion. And why? Because I'm really drawing a lot of comfort actually from the stable business. If there is even room for improvement, it comes from the Private Bank and the Corporate Bank. And if I give you sort of say, my numbers, which I have in my head, even if you say the first quarter in the Corporate Bank was a stellar quarter where potentially on the deposit better, we may see some reduction. But clearly, the Corporate Bank will be well above EUR 7 billion of revenues for the year.  I mean we started with the EUR 1.9 billion. And again, if I all see the forecast and the momentum we have there, it will be clearly a number well above EUR 7 billion. The Private Bank, in my view, very stable. And again, think about that what we always said before that the real impact of the tailwind is still to come. So if I look at last year, if I look at this year, if I look at the first quarter, kind of a number well above EUR 9 billion is well achievable in the Private Bank.  Asset Management, again, a EUR 2.5 billion number with all that, what I can see well achievable. So I think the stable business will be well in excess of EUR 19 billion. If you then think about the EUR 28.5 billion, it's approximately EUR 9 billion, which we need from the Investment Bank.  Now again, I think James said it in his prepared remarks, very strong business actually in the Investment Bank. The episodic items, which we recorded in the first quarter of 2022, we always knew that this is not repeatable, but the underlying flow in the Investment Bank is strong. I just told you about additional investments, which we did also Latin America and so on. So I think what we need to achieve just in order to come to the EUR 28.5 billion would be something like a EUR 9 billion of revenues in the Investment Bank. We took EUR 2.7 billion in. That would mean, on average, a EUR 2.1 billion quarterly, which we have seen and where I'm highly confident to get there, again, based on the momentum. And hence, you know what, the guidance stands, and I'm confident."

        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "On LCR, we'll always back test. I think the industry and working with regulators, we'll back test what we call the outflow assumptions or the liquidity risk drivers. We'll incorporate what we learn into our own internal models and discuss with regulators as an industry, whether there are changes to LCR that are necessary.  I'll tell you that the experience of the last several years, the COVID crisis in 2020, the impact of the inception of the war in Ukraine last year, now the banking sector turbulence, all of those things have actually proven out rather than disprove the severity of the liquidity risk drivers. So we feel really good about what the tool tells us.  You mentioned the CDS market. We think CDS is an important risk management tool as well, helping banks and counterparties manage credit risk. That said, it's an illiquid market, relatively speaking, and is prone to movements that may not reflect a realistic assessment of default probability. And so I think it probably does bear some scrutiny as to how that market works and whether there are ways to improve it.  Let's be clear, I think institutionally and speaking personally, we think short selling is a viable activity. It provides information to the marketplace and is not something that we would criticize in and of itself. The question is, is there a possibility for crosstalk between different parts of the capital structure that really doesn't represent information in the marketplace. And hence, it's something that does bear some -- As I say, we went through this period, which was an idiosyncratic focus, I think, well. In a sense, we were tested, and we showed ourselves to be a strong, stable bank without the vulnerabilities that the market was concerned about. And in a sense, that's a good thing that clients and investors and counterparties were able to see that. So I'd probably leave it there, Tom."

        "text": "The first is on costs. If you can talk a bit about the outlook and guidance. With respect to 2023, Q1 is running in line with the target of flat adjusted and reported. And if we look for the rest of the year, do you see any potential headwinds to your cost target? I mean you mentioned hiring. Is there a risk that we don't end up on a flat adjusted reported cost basis? And in that respect, just confirming the EUR 500 million restructuring costs are incorporated in your flat cost guidance.  And then if we travel from '23 to '25, is that like essentially flat trajectory as well? Or when do the EUR 2.5 billion cost savings come through and other EUR 500 million like an additional saving in your cost path you modeled? Or is it basically offsetting additional headwinds you weren't seeing initially?  And the cost/income ratio target, I realized you've made lots of progress, but still 62.5% looks quite ambitious. What levers do you think you can pull? Or where is the upside potential from where we stand at the moment?  And then second question is on loan losses. Unchanged guidance of 25 to 30 basis points. Q1 is already 30 basis points and your assumption is avoiding a recession in Germany. So how confident are you on your loan loss provision guidance?"

      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "So Anke, thank you for the questions. I'll dive in and Chris, you may want to add. I'll go in reverse order, if I may, Look, as we've talked about, the EUR 372 million this quarter is probably higher than we would have expected, and in particular focus is on the around EUR 120 million that we recognized on the two -- these two individual exposures in the IPB. If you take that out, EUR 250 million in the quarter, is actually a sensible run rate and would certainly deliver on the range and guidance that we've given. We're not seeing indicators at this point of weakness in credit. So as we look at the forward-looking indicators, ratings movements, Stage 2 events and all the metrics we look at, we're just not seeing it yet. We are obviously mindful of the environment that we're in and watching carefully. But to your question about, do the trends support the range, yes, they do. So we're comfortable there.  The question on the path to '25 on cost income ratio, what's the lever? The lever is operating leverage. What we highlighted back in February is that the sort of the cumulative, if you like, the compound rate of operating leverage improvement over the 4 years from '18 was 5% a year. Now we may not achieve that every year, but it doesn't take 5% a year to get us to 62.5% from 67%. And so that's also why we've defined the strategy as we have and why we define acceleration as we've done.  If we can find ways to accelerate revenue growth and at least manage the expense base flat with some of the additional measures that we're taking, at least offsetting additional investments and hopefully bringing a little bit more to the bottom line over that time, we think the math to get to 62.5% is very solid. And as Christian outlined, we'd hope to be able to make that a more easily achievable target, and as I say, potentially create room for reinvestment.  The '23 path, as you say, is one where, as other headwinds, there are always headwinds. We are making investments, whether it's in technology or controls. We're seeing inflation. And we need to work to offset those things. The initiatives we announced today are not that meaningful in terms of '23. So they might help us to the tune of around EUR 50 million in the back half of the year. But they step up over the next couple of years. And so the run rate that we think to the various initiatives that we're talking about should achieve by '25 or if not dribbling a little bit into '26, would be about EUR 250 million. So we think it's a meaningful sort of contribution to the EUR 500 million goal that we have.  We're seeing a number of things. Obviously, in the expense base we've talked about, we're going to continue to fight through now in the second quarter. Work hard to keep the company at that run rate we've talked about. In the second half, we actually start to harvest some benefits of things we've been working on for a while. I think notably, as we complete the integration, while it doesn't immediately happen, we start to harvest the benefits of that investment.  We've talked about the linearity and nonlinearity of certain elements of the EUR 2 billion. So we will continue to work and harvest those. So the short answer is, of course, it's always challenging to manage a company in an environment like this with so many moving parts to a run rate. But we think we've got the tools and the measures in place to do that, and we've got an intense amount of management focus on it. And as Christian says, even more so with Rebecca's expanded responsibilities."

And that tells you also something about the robustness and solidity of Deutsche Bank's credit portfolio.  With the statements James just made that also going forward and the behavior of our credit portfolios, we cannot really see a negative development or a negative outlook.

I mean, yes, we've learned a painful lesson about the speed at which information and arguably, in some cases, misinformation travel in a social media world and the relatively frictionless movement of funds that we have. I think the important lesson is confidence in banking institutions is critical. I think that confidence arises from banks getting the basics right. We think we've got the basics right at Deutsche Bank. And those are -- deposit bases and funding, managing risks carefully, ensuring that you're really adding value for clients. You have a sustainable business model.  And all of these elements, does it affect how you think about LCR? I think LCR is misunderstood in the sense that it is very conservative. And because the banks have chosen since it was introduced to manage to buffers that there's room in that ratio. I think it's important to understand, if a bank hits 100% that -- in our case, we have now 43% margin against the 100%. But at 100%, we're still able to extend a 30-day stress and come outstanding. So it's a conservatively constructed ratio.  You have to remember also that things that flow off the balance sheet affect both the numerator and the depositor -- and the denominator. And so you have this dynamic nature of the ratio on the way down. So it's -- there's a number of interesting features about that tool that would suggest it's -- as it is, it's a very sort of powerful stability driver in the industry.  That doesn't mean we won't examine it. We won't examine individual risk drivers, but my hope is that a combination of the basics and the tools we have today are -- put us in a good place."

It needs to be there. Let's be clear. The sustainability of a bank, which is engaged in maturity transformation relies on that buffer being there. But you want to calibrate it to a level that protects safety and soundness in essentially all market conditions, but then isn't so inefficient that it's an unreasonable tax on shareholders. So that balance is an interesting one, and I think we need to continue to examine.  In general, by the way, banks -- we've -- since the crisis, we have this behavior of preserving buffers. So banks manage now not just with buffers, but with a disincentive to see buffers used. And so I think that whole edifice, in a sense, can be discussed and examined.  But -- and I just want to draw a line under it, in a positive way, the stability and the tools and the post-crisis regulation I think, should be understood as a success based on what we've learned over the past 8 weeks rather than the opposite.  Briefly on commercial real estate, we don't actually look at it in U.S. terms around criticized necessarily in our IFRS accounting. But what I can tell you is that EUR 1.6 billion, so a little bit more than 1/3 would be in Stages 1 and -- sorry, Stages 2 and 3. We think there's -- we're not saying we're immune. We think we're well underwritten. We have a stable portfolio. We think project by project, we're in good shape given the market environment.

Look, we're not at a point where -- I'll start with the Investment Bank because that's where our investors tend to start. I don't think we're at a point of sort of peak revenue potential in the Investment Bank. Because just if you think about where we are, for example, right now in Origination & Advisory, that's still sort of recovering. So we think there's scope to improve there. As Christian mentioned, I think we've got scope to invest in that area and improve our market shares, leave aside the market wallet performance.  Financing is doing quite well, both in volume sort of -- or market opportunity terms and in spreads. And then I think our markets businesses have been strong performers and also risk managers. Of course, in that business, we're going to ride a little bit the volatility and the volumes in the marketplace, but we feel good about the way the business has come together under Ram's leadership. So all of those things would tell us we can at least sustain and perhaps improve on the Investment Bank.  The -- Christian mentioned earlier, Private Bank still has a way to run in terms of the momentum that interest rates deliver, let alone assets under management, loan and deposit growth in the case of loans at loans outside of mortgages. So we feel comfortable there's a good path there. And while some of the -- I think we're probably past peak lag, but we're not past the generalized improvement in the rate environment in Corporate Bank.  Lastly, I think the Asset Management business by executing the plan Stefan Hoops has laid out has a clear path to growth in assets. Obviously, it will ride the market a little bit but is also not anywhere near sort of its peak revenue potential. So all of those things, I think, feed into '24 and then '25, and there is sort of a sustainable momentum built into that.  Your second question was liquidity in March and what can we do? Look, we're acutely aware that -- I don't think we were singled out uniquely, but we were in a group that were potentially perceived as vulnerable to the issues that arose. As I said earlier, it's gratifying that the market can very quickly identify that those vulnerabilities did not exist with us or, frankly, our peers in Europe that might otherwise have also come in to pressure.  I think the answer to your question is the more we execute on our strategy, the more we deliver sustainable profitability but also the more we put historical issues around control failures and other events in the past. I hope that what I would -- some call muscle memory will fade in the market and the sort of the beta nature of Deutsche Bank will fade.  As a management team, I think we're all very committed to achieving that goal. It lies in our hands to some extent around execution. It lies in investors' hands in terms of their support for our securities."

Clearly, expectation on rates have gone up but also deposit betas seem to be low. So just a bit of color on both sides of the balance sheet there and what that means for this year's guidance. And just to add kind of what your deposit assumptions are from here within that guidance, the full year '23 and beyond?  And then secondly, on capital, Christian, you mentioned the EUR 15 billion to EUR 20 billion of RWA relief. I just want to understand your guys thinking on how to redeploy that kind of EUR 2 billion plus potentially of capital unlocked whether that's going to go back into the balance sheet, what businesses you see growth in or kind of what decisions would come to returning that to shareholders, as you mentioned?  And finally, just a clarification. On 4Q, you were talking about kind of the regulatory inflation to come with offset. Is the market risk benefit you've taken this quarter the offsetting item that we've discussed in previous quarters?"

        "text": "So Adam, I'm not sure I follow all the questions, but let me start with NII trajectory. What I do is refer you back to Page 26 of the February 2 materials. Now we're not going to update the NII trajectory sort of every quarter. But I would say that the assumptions there on Page 26 are still pretty good assumptions. There are always movements up and down in how NII will perform. But this idea that we would put on at that time, 900, I think it's actually a little bit better than 900 given assumptions have improved relative to our expectations at that time this year is still a really good assumption.  So we did EUR 13.65 billion of net interest income last year. If that grew by EUR 1 billion or more, that would be a good assumption. There might be sort of a plateau or even a small dip in '24. And then as you see, there's another leg up in '25 as the interest rate characteristics in the Private Bank come through. So that -- I think that guidance still holds.  Now one thing just to advise you, if you look at interest income in Q1 and attempt to annualize it, you won't get to that number precisely because as we highlight, there's been a swing in the characteristic of the revenue recognition. Think of it a little bit like trading NIM in the U.S. banks, more of the revenues were characterized as fair value through P&L in Q1 than would be typical, and we can get into the reasons for that. But -- so don't be concerned that there's any difference in the guidance from that sort of anomaly. We're very comfortable with the guidance that we've given. And actually, at the moment, we're seeing, based on the curve and the funding profile, we see a little bit of upside to our earlier guidance."

But clearly, we also believe that with the increased profitability, which we expect and with that capital efficiency, which we outlined on Page 7. And by the way, again, this has not been only a top-down but bottom-up analysis, which we even curtailed a bit top-down. So there is real potential. Of course, we will think about how much of these additional savings we can also hand back to our shareholders.  So I think if you ask me today, it will be a combination of reinvestment into those business, which is really then capital rewarding and where we have a very good story for our shareholders and investors, but part of that will be also given back to the shareholders."

Think of the EUR 15 billion to EUR 20 billion as being a net reduction from that guidance. So we would expect, based on everything we know right now, to be somewhere in the low 400s, 400 to 410. And so that can give you a sense if you're building your model based on organic revenue generation, the Basel III impact that we've talked about of about EUR 30 billion of RWA gives you a little bit of sense of where it can provide, at the very least, additional support for the capital trajectory that we've laid out already."

I mean if I look at the turnaround of the bank, and I think Berlin should send you two medals, both to Christian and James, the market is clearly thinking differently. I mean, you're trading at 0.3x tangible book. You're trading at 5x roughly -- year's earnings. So there's a disconnect. And I'm just trying to understand how you're going to bridge that disconnect. And if there's going to be any change in the sense that you're going to overcommunicate maybe in Investor Day or any other measures that you feel are understood in particular, that we should be thinking about and investors should be thinking about?  And the second question is I'm quite interested in some management changes that you have announced. And clearly, you have being the COO and also being responsible for cost besides the transformation. Just wondering if there's any change in your thinking around cost? I mean it feels like there is from the language but just wondering if there's any -- and clearly, the EUR 500 million. But I wonder if there's any change in the way we should think about Deutsche and cost management going forward now relative to last year?"

        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Yes. Thank you, Kian. And look, let me try to start and James will jump in. Look, it's always hard to talk yourself about why we are perceived in the market as we are perceived. This is actually a question I would like to always hand back to you guys that you tell us what we can do better in communicating.  Look, I give you three items and one of that is not meant in any defensive way. But I do believe that if you just think 14 months back, where we stood in February 2022 before this awful war broke out, I think, at some point in time, we were a share price around 14 30 or something like that, not that this would be our ultimate goal, as you know. But you could see that actually people started to think about this is going into the right direction.  Now I still believe that the overall uncertainty -- the geopolitical uncertainty is a drag for us and that we are still kind of suffering from that. That is point number one.  Point number two is clearly that we have to show and we also hear it on this call, and I think it's only delivery, but you have two very resilient people here on this call. And we will drive this resilience, and we will show you quarter by quarter, week by week, month by month and day by day that we keep the ship exactly in this direction. But the composition of Deutsche Bank of the revenues completely changed.  We have 66% of revenues from the Corporate Bank, Private Bank and Asset Management. And if you would listen to me for another 2 hours, I can tell you these revenues in these businesses only have one direction. And it will -- this 66% will be kind of the ratio potentially, it even goes into an even more favorable number if you think about balanced versus -- a stable versus less stable business, it even goes into an even more favorable number.  So we have a bank which is now that balance, that stable from a profitability, from a sustainability of revenues that I'm very, very confident that we can show quarter-by-quarter a very sustainable development.  Now to the Investment Bank, to be honest, I think we are -- and again, potentially we need to do a better job, and I'm the first one who tries to learn. But I think the inner stability of the Investment Bank with all the changes we have done over the last 4 years is far stronger than potentially the market thinks about it. James just talked about the financing business, a very stable business. I think it's a financing business in the Investment Bank, which is, in my view, among the top 3 in the world. Also from an underwriting standards, if you think about the value chain from the first line of defense to the second line of defense.  I think it's a business where even others outside people of Deutsche and saying, this is -- honestly, this is top of the -- business. That is a business which is constantly there, continuously there with about EUR 3 billion of revenues. We have reconfigurated the trading business under Ram to one of the leading trading businesses. Again, if you look at Q1 and take out the idiosyncratic items, I'm just mentioning the name, which we talked about in '21 and '22, a lot, which obviously is not something which comes back every quarter, then the underlying business in the Investment Bank in 2022 in the first quarter -- 2023 in the first quarter was actually stronger than in the first quarter of 2022, despite it was a very strong quarter.  We will see now a comeback in the O&A business in the Investment Bank. We do some selective investments there because we see the market opportunities and we will be awake for these market opportunities. So that I think you have three very stable business with the interest rates still to come in one of our largest business, which is the Private Bank, with revenues above EUR 9 billion, clearly above EUR 9 billion. So that I think from a pure revenue point of view, I think this bank has completely turned around, and we are playing there where the clients want us to play and where we see the momentum.  Secondly, on the cost side, yes, we are now in the second phase, and I'm grateful for your question, Kian. We're in the second phase of real cost takeout. And that is a cost takeout, which now goes in particular, front to back, that we see the revised processes where we have invested a lot in the front offices, which now need to go into the infrastructure because we need one process from the originating to the infrastructure. And for that, we decided that all COOs in the infrastructure functions are now sub summarized under Rebecca so that we can do the changes in one process from the front office into the various infrastructure functions.  Secondly, when you have invested so much into controls and we are keep doing this, at some point in time, obviously, automation and machine learning, artificial intelligence, but in particular, automation will also lead over time to reduce cost. Unity will pay off as we said.  So what you now see in the second phase of taking cost out is not like in the first phase that we exited business, and we took those costs out but it's actually the smart takeout of cost, plus a constant revenue also of our workforce where we need to do something. So the reduction in force action is something which we have done now. And I'm sure we will do similar things in '24, '25 again. That is a constant review of our organization that's all now under Rebecca. And I think with one person driving that, we will even have more force on it.  So I think it's a normal development in transforming an organization but with the robustness and resilience of the revenues. And that discipline on the cost management, I do believe that we will show now quarter-by-quarter, year-by-year that this bank is on the right track. And at some point in time, I'm sure that also the investors will see that. If this is then even joined by hopefully, and this is, I think, the most important we should all look at that this awful war comes to an end at some point in time, I think that also Europe will be seen differently. And then latest then, we will also have relief from that side. With your medal item, actually, I will bring that message to Berlin."

If I use the math that you were talking about, you kind of suggested, I guess, off of a 13.6% to 13.2% CET1 ratio, 40 bps, so EUR 1.4 billion for buybacks, growth and other things. But then obviously, the last buyback was about EUR 300 million. So I'm just trying to get a sense of are you thinking of -- or have you asked the numbers in the kind of EUR 750 million to EUR 1 billion range? Or is it kind of closer to what was previously done?  And then the second question, just a follow-up on the LCR ratio. I guess in the end, I suppose I'm just wondering, are you going to continue to target 130% and trend down towards that level? And -- or are you going to look to keep the LCR similar to where it is today? And do you have a benefit in your plan on revenues for bringing that LCR down to 130%?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Thanks, Amit. Look, your math is right. So the 40 basis points would represent something a little shy of EUR 1.5 billion, so use EUR 1.5 billion. As Christian indicated, we look at last year's buyback at EUR 300 million. And given the progress we've made -- and by the way, I don't want to be committed to a specific number, a specific timing, and it's too early, obviously, and we need to go through this with the supervisors in presenting a new capital plan. But a step forward on last year's number would be consistent with the guidance or the capital planning that we shared with you back in March of last year.  And as Christian mentioned to maybe give you a sense of ranging then, a 50% increase in dividend if that was mirrored also with the -- an increase of the buyback of a similar amount, it would give you a sense of a range of what we think it might be sought by us.  I will say that given the starting point of the 40 basis points, that's why we think it's -- this type of ask would be affordable. There' uncertainties in the environment. You would expect us to remain prudent. But as we say, with the buffers we have, we think we have space for something like that.  In LCR, we were very conscious as we went through Q1 that we had a high print at the end of December. That was frankly an accident. The average last quarter and the average this quarter are both almost exactly where you'd want it to be in this low 130% range. If we're targeting 130% then you'd expect us to be a little bit higher than 130%. I would -- I think for this quarter, we'd probably target a gentle decline. We are mindful that the risks in the outlook haven't entirely abated. But I wouldn't want you to be surprised if the number started with 130% next -- when we're talking with each other again in July.  As to the cost of that buffer, obviously, it does play a role, but it is very dynamic. So I wouldn't tie a specific revenue better or worse number to a ratio better or worse view. I hope that helps."

And with full year results, you said that again, you expected it to this year, but it hasn't. It shrunk slightly in Q1. And I just wondered how much of that was deliberate -- sort of deliberately steering the balance sheet smaller in a choppy environment versus kind of lack of opportunity to deploy? So that's my first question.  And then my second question really just on the capital surpluses, uses, et cetera. Is 13% CET1, or 13.2%, is that still the right reference level in a world where the market is nervous, not just the market, but the world more broadly is nervous around banks? And there's things like Basel IV to be funded, some banks are prefunding that, et cetera. So is 13% still the right reference level to be talking about for capital?"

Remember that in our capital plan, we will be building to Basel III final framework and in this plan, because of the model adjustments, higher LED floors and various items, that 13.2% has been getting steadily more conservative in how we're capitalizing our risks. So we do think it is appropriate to continue to target that level.  As you say, there will be a bubble in '24 that sort of goes away on 1st of January '25, all things equal that we need to build into our planning. But we feel comfortable with the buffer at 200 basis points above MDA. As I say, it's getting more conservative steadily.  On capital management and the deliberate nature, to be fair, it actually wasn't deliberate. Are we looking at risk appetite carefully and extensions of balance sheet in this environment, of course. But actually, the usual seasonality was a little bit less than we might otherwise have expected both on leverage exposure and RWA. And we do think loan growth is probably a little slower in the coming quarters than we might have expected given credit conditions, the possibility of recession, all the features in the environment today."

So you've given some very good transparency around deposit flows, pre and post the events in March. I wonder if you can just give any comment on what you're seeing in the wholesale funding markets? I think you were saying around the March events time that you had about 50% of the funding plan for this year done. Most of that was coming into senior nonpreferred and covered bonds. But have you been able to access the markets post those events? And are spreads getting to -- back to some sort of acceptable levels?

Richard's with me in the room here, and we look forward to talking with our fixed income investors tomorrow, but nice to have fixed income topics on the equity call.  Look, we were -- we came into the year, as we mentioned, cautious about the environment. When we saw the market opening in the first few weeks of the year, we decided to move quickly, much quicker than our original funding plan might have suggested. And so we were pleased to have done all that, not just senior nonpreferred, by the way, but we did covered it, and we did a Tier 2 issue before the end of February. And we've done an AT1 deal late last year, which might look like expensive capital, but it gave us real comfort traveling into an uncertain '23 that we were making the right decisions for the bank.  We haven't really gone to the market since the turbulence started in any meaningful way. I think we may have done a covered bond in the interim. But the reason is not because we don't have access to it, but we don't like the price. And prefunding, therefore, was, I think, economically sensible and has actually given us, to the earlier question, from Chris, I think, has given us a slightly better funding profile than for this year and going into '24 than we might have other expected. Sorry, it was Adam's question, on the path of net interest income.  On AT1, we think the market healed more quickly than we might have expected after that Sunday. Look, the instrument sort of -- the instrument had challenges at inception as the market was being created. And I think it has now established a good convention with good investor understanding of what the various triggers and what have you are in it. And I think it will survive in this for. It's conceivably will be a little bit more expensive for banks to issue AT1 securities. But -- and I think it's worth a look at that, but our sense is that it will continue to be a viable instrument going forward.  For us, again, given we were conservative around our issuance -- we don't have a call date until 2025. And as I say, we're in a good place on our funding plan for this year. So we feel, overall, very constructive about where we see. As we stand, our hope and expectation is spreads will narrow again in the coming months."

And if I think this is, for me, the #1 lesson learned.  And if you start from that, I think there is no reason to kind of now come up with whatever it's called, you call it, knee-jerk reaction to think about further rules. And to be very honest, I think the discussions we have also after these events are done in a very constructive way that everybody looks at potential loopholes still or weaknesses that is clear, and I think this should be done like we do it if there -- if something is happening on our side. But I can tell you that these discussions are really constructive, and I think the regulators, in particular, in Europe, should look back and saying, very stable system.  In this regard, I also do hope that from an SRF point of view, from a deposit scheme and from the single resolution fund that we don't see a different direction. And to be honest, I'm not hearing this. And again, one should also not only think about the single resolution fund, but also that we have national schemes, which worked in the past.

There's a nuance in it, which has to do with what collateral is posted in the TLTRO program versus unencumbered. So it is a support to the ratio. But one that we're -- we have a funding plan to wean ourselves off of over time. And it actually does give us some flexibility in how we manage collateral across the bank. . In CB, in round numbers, we were sort of flattish on fees and commission, a little bit up. Volumes were -- depending on whether you're looking year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter, flat to up slightly.

Could you talk a bit about how the beta has been evolving between retail and corporates, a bit of color on the mix shift and also how is Deutsche Bank reacting to competition in terms of repricing?"

So there can be, for example, senior revolvers to real estate investment trusts. There can be sort of working capital. Sometimes construction lending to corporates that are recourse in nature, but where you have lean on property. There's a bunch of things there that -- also, by the way, wealth management, where you'd be lending to wealthy individuals who are investing in either their own businesses or in commercial real estate investments on their part.  So it's -- as a -- in terms of the nature or the riskiness if you like, and the underlying exposure, it is very different to the nonrecourse portfolio. And hence, our own sort of focus versus the rest portfolio distinction. And the losses in that -- in those portfolios have been negligible historically, just negligible.  On the LTVs, what we provide is the most recent. So our practice is to have external valuations no less frequently than once a year. Our internal views are updated no less frequently than every 6 months. So you do get, if not a real time. There is, of course, a little bit of a lag in that, but you get relatively speaking LTVs that adjust over time.  Your beta development question is an interesting one. We look at it both by currency and by portfolio. As you'd expect, the dollar has moved more quickly and I think is catching up with the models more quickly, getting, I would argue, close on the retail side to what we might have expected and closer on corporate. The euro is lagging that in both cases considerably based both on the recency of the rate increases. And I think just the nature and structure of the European deposit funding market. So the euro continues to outperform, again, across both portfolios.  And while that beta also has a little bit of a lag in it, looking at March right now, the turbulence the industry went through, I think it had an impact. But I wouldn't say it was a dramatic impact, at least in our estimation on that beta trajectory."

What does that look like on a group basis when you take into account the larger corporate deposits? And then secondly, for your group NIM, I guess that's 1.6% on an adjusted basis. How does your group -- how should that develop with respect to the hedge gains that you've also had in the coming quarters? And do you have an expectation for that group NIM and how that should develop going forward?  And then lastly, in a post trim world, why is Deutsche Bank having a 40 to 60 basis point hit on the CET1 ratio, largely due to a review of internal modeling?"

        "text": "So Andrew, thank you for sticking with us. Sorry, the questions are coming so late in the call. The -- let me start with the NIM. I'm always a little bit cautious about predicting NIMs because there are so many moving parts in it. But in round numbers, if you take our guidance from the beginning of the year, which would have led you to kind of the mid-14s, maybe a little better and interest-earning assets of somewhere a little bit below EUR 1 trillion, you'd probably be in the 150 basis point range again, subject for the year, subject to some swings on the characterization that I mentioned. And we do provide, as always, the profitability by segment, including both net interest revenues and fair value through PT -- through profit and loss. So you see the total profitability, if you like, that the balance sheet produces with that.  In terms of the deposit base, the total deposit base, the numbers we gave you, I think, were 33% of the total deposit base under statutory insurance, 41% with -- if you exclude banks from that. I think your question maybe what is the German deposit base in total? Is that right? And that's a number we -- I don't have to hand. I'd have to get back to you on if that was the question you're after."

        "text": "Yes. I mean the post-TRIM world is really characterized by some of the EBA guidance that came out and the implementation of that. So it particularly relates to LGDs. To a lesser extent, some of the other factors. It's kind of been rolling through the portfolio. So we did see some in retail last year and as we've talked about more next year. So it hasn't been uniquely to either the Investment Bank or the Corporate Bank, but it's gone portfolio by portfolio. . There will be some implementation of new models in the aftermath of our Unity technology implementation. They're just -- there's a dependency there. So there will be some adjustments in the models that are implemented then in Q3 also on the PB side, on the Private Bank side. And my -- I believe that by the end of the year then, we will have been through the reviews that we need to with the ECB and implemented what there is to do. '24 should be a cleaner year and give us the ability to prepare then for Basel III final framework implementation on the 1st of January '25."

    "transcript": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome and thanks for joining the Deutsche Bank Q2 2023 Analyst Conference Call. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to [indiscernible], Deputy Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2023 results call. As usual, our Chief Executive Officer, Christian Sewing, will speak first; followed by our Chief Financial Officer, James von Moltke. The presentation, as always, is available to download in the Investor Relations section of our website, @db.com. Before we get started, let me just remind you that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which may not develop as we currently expect. We, therefore, ask you to take notice of the precautionary warning at the end of our materials. With that, let me hand over to Christian.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, Silke, and a warm welcome also from my side. It\u2019s a pleasure to be discussing our second quarter and first half results with you today. These results provide a vital perspective of the progress we are making towards our objectives. For me, a few key points stand out. First, we have strong growth momentum. Revenues in the first half year were up 8% to \u20ac15.1 billion, putting the upper end of our guidance range of \u20ac28 billion to \u20ac29 billion within reach. We also captured net inflows of \u20ac28 billion across the Private Bank and Asset Management. We are reaping the benefits of a complementary and well-balanced earnings mix. We are delivering strong growth in our Private Bank and Corporate Bank franchises, and resilience in key areas of our Investment Bank. Second, we have proven our earnings power. We generated profit before tax of \u20ac3.3 billion in the first six months, up 2% over last year and the highest first half since 2011, after absorbing more than \u20ac700 million in non-operating costs, including restructuring related to operational efficiencies. Excluding these non-operating costs, pre-tax profit would have been \u20ac4 billion, 21% higher than in the first half of 2022 on a comparable basis. Our post-tax RoTE was 6.8%, and would have been above 9%, excluding non-operating costs and with bank levies apportioned equally across the year; very close to our 2025 target, of above 10%. Third, our balance sheet and capital position are resilient. Our CET1 ratio has risen to 13.8%, driven by strong organic capital generation. We have sound liquidity and a solid deposit base, which we slightly increased in the second quarter. Fourth: we are delivering on our promise to distribute capital to shareholders. As announced yesterday evening, we have received supervisory approval to start share buybacks of up to \u20ac450 million, 50% higher than last year. Together with the dividend we paid in respect of 2022, we aim to distribute more than \u20ac1 billion of capital to shareholders this year. This will bring total distributions across 2022 and 2023 to around \u20ac1.75 billion and of course, it is our clear aim to continue on that trajectory in 2024 as part of our \u20ac8 billion distribution promise. Fifth: we are accelerating the execution of our Global Hausbank strategy. We are already making good progress in driving operational efficiency, boosting capital efficiency, and outperforming our revenue growth target. Let me now discuss the franchise strength across our businesses in the first half year, on Slide 2. Starting with the Corporate Bank; we delivered 30% revenue growth with strong momentum across all business areas. With noninterest expenses up 6%, operating leverage in this business was 24% in the first half of 2023. That enabled us to deliver an RoTE of nearly 17%. In the Investment Bank; we demonstrated the stability of our Financing business and resilience of our FIC franchise overall, after the exceptionally strong levels of the same period of last year and we are further diversifying our Investment Bank by strengthening our O&A business, both organically and inorganically. We announced the acquisition of Numis and seized opportunities to add revenue generators through selective hiring. Turning to the Private Bank; we grew revenues by 10% in the first half of 2023. These are the best six month revenues since the formation of the Private Bank, with double-digit year-on-year growth in both the first and second quarters of the year. We also generated net inflows of \u20ac13 billion in the first half year. This helped us grow Assets under Management by \u20ac23 billion, to \u20ac541 billion, during the first six months of 2023. Finally, we also grew volumes in Asset Management. We captured net asset inflows of \u20ac15 billion, or \u20ac19 billion ex-Cash, driven by Passive and Alternatives, both focus areas for us. That enabled us to grow assets under management by \u20ac38 billion euros, to \u20ac859 billion in the first half year and these businesses are strongly complementary, which drives sustained revenue growth as we show on slide three. Over the past two years, we have seen steady growth in first-half revenues. We see ourselves well on track to deliver at the higher end of our full-year guidance of \u20ac28 billion to \u20ac29 billion. We achieved this despite significant shifts in the operating environment over the past 24 months, as a strong post-COVID recovery in 2021 gave way to inflationary headwinds and economic uncertainties driven by the war in Ukraine. We maintained our growth trajectory in a changing environment; thanks, in good measure, to a complementary business portfolio. As mentioned, we delivered strong revenue growth in our Corporate and Private Banks, which took full advantage of rising interest rates and new client mandates. We expect that momentum to continue into the second half of 2023. This, together with the stable contribution from the Investment Bank\u2019s Financing business, more than offset normalizing conditions in our more market-sensitive businesses. That reflects a well-balanced revenue mix in line with our Global Hausbank ambition. As we anticipate some normalization of interest rates, we aim to further complement our earnings mix. We are making investments in \u2018capital light\u2019 businesses, including Origination & Advisory and Wealth Management, together with technology-enabled high-return businesses in the Corporate Bank. Finally: across all business, we continue to make progress towards our sustainability targets. We added ESG financing and investment volumes of \u20ac17 billion in the second quarter, bringing our cumulative total to \u20ac254 billion since January 2020. And our business growth has further increased our underlying earnings power, as we set out on Slide 4. As I said earlier, our first-half profit before tax, of \u20ac3.3 billion, was up 2% compared to the first half of 2022, and as you can see, pre-provision profit was up 8% at \u20ac4 billion, after absorbing significantly higher non-operating costs than in the prior year. Non-operating costs were \u20ac744 million, comprising litigation charges to settle mainly longstanding matters and restructuring and severance as we realise operational efficiencies. Revenues were up 8%, while adjusted costs, which exclude non-operating items, were up only 2%, below inflation, despite continued investments in our platform. And with pro-rated bank levies, adjusted operating leverage was 5%. This earnings power is reflected in the progress we are making on our key target ratios. Post-tax RoTE, excluding non-operating costs and with bank levies apportioned equally over the four quarters of the year, would be over 9% in the first half of 2023, while our cost-income ratio would be 67%. In other words; we\u2019re on a clear path towards achieving our 2025 targets. Before I hand over to James, a few words on the progress we\u2019re making to accelerate delivery of our Global Hausbank strategy, as we discussed with you in April, on Slide 5. We aim to accelerate delivery on three dimensions: operational efficiency, capital efficiency, and revenue growth, where we aim to outperform our original targets. We have already made progress in all of these. Turning first to operational efficiencies; we raised our ambition for incremental efficiencies from \u20ac2 billion to \u20ac2.5 billion, as we said. We have already delivered more than \u20ac600 million, through a range of measures such as branch closures in the Private Bank, standardizing loan processing in the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank and simplifying our technology infrastructure. We anticipate \u20ac300 million of savings by 2025 from the successfully completed migration of 12 million Postbank clients onto the Deutsche Bank technology platform and we expect more than \u20ac100 million from the announced redundancies in senior non-client facing roles as more than 80% of affected staff have either been informed or left the platform. In other words, a total of around \u20ac1 billion in savings are either already achieved, or are expected from measures now implemented. We have a series of other measures in flight; for example, streamlining our mortgage business and further branch closures in the Private Bank, reengineering more front-to-back processes in the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank, further application de-commissioning, and additional workforce measures. These are some examples of a wider programme of initiatives underway. Based on our progress on these, and realized achievements so far, we reaffirm our \u20ac2.5 billion goal. In respect of capital efficiencies: as you know, our aim is to reduce risk weighted assets by \u20ac15 billion to \u20ac20 billion by 2025 relative to our baseline assumptions with a modest revenue impact. In the second quarter, we accelerated securitisation transactions, which delivered RWA relief of around \u20ac3 billion. In addition, credit risk RWAs were reduced as part of the Trade Finance and Lending optimization efforts. Overall, we proved our revenue strength with the business delivering revenue growth while our FX adjusted RWAs decreased by \u20ac5 billion compared to the prior year quarter. We have further optimization measures in preparation for the second half of 2023 including securitisation of consumer finance loans and reductions in sub-hurdle lending. All this gives us confidence that we will deliver on our capital optimisation goals. Turning finally to revenue growth; we are fully on track to outperform on our revenue growth targets of 3.5% to 4.5% compound annual growth against 2021 levels. On a last 12-month basis, we delivered compound annual revenue growth versus 2021 of 7.5%, well ahead of that target, with revenue growth of 8% in the first half of this year. We expect the interest rate environment to continue to drive sustainable performance in our stable businesses. We anticipate added momentum from our organic and inorganic investments, including the Numis acquisition or the new partnership with Lufthansa and Miles & More, and from hiring of some 50 senior O&A bankers. This enables us to take advantage of an expected pickup in corporate finance activity. We are already seeing signs of this in our backlog. We have also hired around 30 wealth managers. And we expect the growth in our assets under management, and net asset inflows, to drive fee income in future quarters. To sum up, we are delivering revenue and business growth off a strong franchise. Our well-balanced, complementary business mix enables us to drive continued revenue momentum; we are increasing our earnings power year by year, and we see a clear path to achieving our 2025 profitability targets, amongst others an RoTE of larger than 10% in 2025 and we are delivering on two key promises; distributing \u20ac8 billion to shareholders, and accelerating execution of our Global Hausbank strategy. With that: let me hand over to James.\nJames von Moltke: Thank you, Christian. Let me start with a few key performance indicators on slide 7, and place them in the context of our 2025 targets. Christian outlined the strong revenue momentum and our well-balanced business mix which resulted in revenue growth of well above 7% on a compound basis for the last 12 months relative to 2021. This performance puts us well on track to deliver revenue growth above our 2025 target. The strong revenue growth combined with ongoing cost discipline led to a two-percentage point improvement in the cost-income ratio to 73% in the first six months compared to 2022, despite significantly higher non-operating expenses in the second quarter, which we would not expect to repeat in the same magnitude in coming periods. Our capital position has remained strong and our CET1 ratio of 13.8% positions us well for capital distributions, investments and the implementation of regulatory changes. Our liquidity metrics remained strong. The LCR was 137%, above our target of around 130%, and in the second quarter, the net stable funding ratio was 119%. In short, our performance in the period reaffirms our confidence in reaching our 2025 targets. With that, let me turn to the second-quarter highlights on Slide 8. Group revenues were \u20ac7.4 billion, up 11% on the second quarter of 2022. Noninterest expenses were \u20ac5.6 billion, up 15% year-on-year- The increase was largely driven by the \u20ac655 million of non-operating expenses in the quarter, compared to \u20ac102 million in the prior year period. Non-operating expenses this quarter included \u20ac260 million of restructuring and severance provisions to accelerate the execution of our Global Hausbank strategy, primarily through a reduction in non-client facing roles and optimization of our mortgage platform. To settle a number of longstanding litigation matters, we incurred litigation charges of \u20ac395 million as, in each case, the outcome was higher than expected. Adjusted costs increased year-on-year, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac401 million or 33 basis points of average loans. We generated a profit before tax of \u20ac1.4 billion, down 9% year-on-year, mainly due to the higher non-operating items. Net profit of \u20ac900 million was also impacted by the higher effective tax rate, principally reflecting the non-deductibility of certain litigation charges. Our cost income ratio was just under 76% and our post-tax return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity was 5.4% in the quarter. Excluding the aforementioned non-operating expenses, the cost/income ratio would have been 67% and post-tax return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity close to 9%. Diluted earnings per share was \u20ac0.19 in the second quarter and tangible book value per share was \u20ac26.95, up 5% year-on-year. Let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results, starting with interest rate developments on Slide 9. Net interest margin in the Private Bank and Corporate Bank remained strong in the second quarter as deposit betas remain below our modelled assumptions in both divisions. We expect margins to begin to decline from this point, but expect that the tailwind from interest rates for 2023 will be larger than the \u20ac900 million we had guided at the start of the year. Net interest margin at the group level increased to 1.5% as the accounting effects we noted in the first quarter partially reversed. As we noted at the time, these effects are held in C&O and are offset in non-interest revenues in the businesses and do not affect the group\u2019s total revenues. Average interest earning assets declined compared to the first quarter driven by lower average cash balances in the second quarter. With that: let\u2019s turn to adjusted costs, on Slide 10. Adjusted costs excluding bank levies were \u20ac4.9 billion and this is consistent with our guidance range of \u20ac1.6 billion to \u20ac1.65 billion per month. The increase of 4% was driven by inflationary pressures, ongoing investments and business growth which are partially offset by our continued cost reduction efforts. Compensation and benefits and information technology costs were broadly flat to the prior year quarter. Higher professional service costs were driven by business consulting and legal fees. The variance in other costs includes higher expenses for banking services and outsourced operations as well as movements in operational taxes. We also saw a normalization of marketing spend and talent recruitment to foster our growth trajectory. Let\u2019s now turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 11. Provision for credit losses in the second quarter was \u20ac401 million, equivalent to 33 basis points of average loans, slightly up compared to the previous quarter reflecting the broader impact of the macro environment. Stages 1 and 2 provisions were \u20ac63 million with the moderate sequential increase driven by portfolio and rating movements, especially in the Investment Bank. Stage 3 provisions of \u20ac338 million were broadly spread across our businesses and slightly lower compared to the previous quarter, partly reflecting a non-recurrence of provisions relating to a small number of idiosyncratic events in the International Private Bank. Overall, there are currently no signs of a persistent deterioration in the environment; however, we observed softening in some German midcap sectors, including Automotive, and continued weakness in Commercial Real Estate. For the full year, we continue to expect provisions to land within our guidance range of 25 basis points to 30 basis points of average loans, albeit at the upper end of the range. Looking at the first six months, provisions were in line with our expectations if we exclude the non-recurring events in the International Private Bank we had in the first quarter and for the second half of the year, we expect the usual quarterly run-rate of about \u20ac150 million in the Private Bank, while provisions in the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank are expected to overall remain in line with the first half of the year, taken together. Before we move to performance in our businesses, let me turn to capital on Slide 17. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 13.8% at the end of the second quarter, 15 basis points above the prior period. Organic capital generation contributed 16 basis points to the increase, reflecting our strong net income which was offset mainly by higher regulatory deductions for common equity dividends and AT1 coupons. Risk weighted assets remained broadly flat this quarter. In the second half of the year, we expect approximately 70 basis points of headwinds from various items we have discussed with you before, notably impacts from model and methodology changes, share buybacks and the Numis acquisition and our leverage ratio was 4.7% at the end of the second quarter, four basis points up versus the prior quarter based on our strong organic capital generation. Let\u2019s now turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 14. Corporate Bank revenues in the second quarter were over \u20ac1.9 billion, 25% higher year-on-year driven by an improved interest rate environment and continued pricing discipline, with growth across all client segments. Revenues remained close to the prior quarter due to continued lagging rate pass-through, fee growth in Institutional Client Services and stabilized deposit volumes. As we highlighted at our first quarter results, we do expect a normalization of our interest revenues in the second half of the year as client pass-through further accelerates. Deposits were \u20ac271 billion, essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter and to the first quarter 2023 as deposit levels stabilized despite increased interest rate competition and strong pricing discipline. Loan volume in the Corporate Bank was \u20ac116 billion, down by \u20ac13 billion compared to the prior year quarter and \u20ac5 billion compared to the previous quarter. This reduction reflected overall lower demand and continued selective balance sheet deployment in our Trade Finance & Lending business as well as the negative impact from FX movements. We remain conservative in our underwriting at this point in the cycle and continue to apply strict lending standards in order to maintain the high quality of our loan portfolio. Provision for credit losses increased in the quarter reflecting a weakening in certain sub-sectors- Noninterest expenses were \u20ac1.2 billion, an increase of 10% year on year driven by increased non-operating costs, predominantly litigation provisions, whereas adjusted costs remained stable. Profit before tax was \u20ac670 million in the quarter, up by 52% year-on-year. The cost/income ratio improved to 59% and post-tax return on tangible equity was 14.8%, despite higher non-recurring costs. I\u2019ll now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 15. Revenues for the second quarter were 11% lower year-on-year. FIC Sales & Trading decreased by 10% against what was an exceptional prior year quarter, and we are pleased with the underlying performance, which remained strong, with growth in structured activity helping to reduce the impact from a lower volatility environment. Financing revenues were higher year on year, reflecting the proven stability of the franchise, with net interest margin remaining robust and solid pipeline execution. Credit trading revenues were significantly higher driven by improvements in the flow business and strong performance in Distressed. Rates and Foreign Exchange revenues were significantly lower compared to a very strong prior year quarter and reflected a more normalized market environment than the prior year period. Emerging markets revenues were lower, as expected, with the prior year seeing heightened market activity linked to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and outperformance in the Asia region. Moving to Origination & Advisory, revenues were up 25%, driven by the non-recurrence of material leverage lending markdowns in the prior year. Excluding these markdowns, the business underperformed in a challenging market, with the global fee pool down approximately 20% year-on-year. Debt Origination revenues were significantly higher benefitting from the non-repeat of the aforementioned markdowns, though performance also reflected a partial year-on-year recovery in LDCM market share. Investment Grade revenues were slightly down year-on-year, but reflected market share gains in a lower fee pool environment. Advisory revenues were significantly lower reflecting both lower fee pool and relative underperformance. With indications that deal activity is starting to recover, we expect our investments in the Investment Bank to result in a significant rebound in the O&A performance into 2024. Noninterest expenses and adjusted costs increased versus the prior year, reflecting investments in both in our controls and the business to support future revenue growth. Loan balances were slightly higher year-on-year driven by higher origination across FIC, with quarter-on-quarter balances essentially flat. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac141 million, or 54 basis points of average loans. The increase versus the prior year was driven by higher Stage 1 and 2 provisions due to rating migrations and portfolio movements, combined with higher Stage 3 impairments, primarily in the Commercial Real Estate sector. Turning to the Private Bank on Slide 16; reported revenues were \u20ac2.4 billion in the quarter, up 11% year-on-year driven by higher deposit revenues. Revenues in the Private Bank Germany significantly increased by 16%, mainly due to higher deposit revenues, which more than compensated for changes in contractual and regulatory conditions effecting fee income. In addition, the prior year quarter benefited from higher valuation impacts. In the International Private Bank, revenues were up 4% or 6% if adjusted for forgone revenues from the sale of the Financial Advisory business in Italy. Growth was driven by deposit products, which also were the primary driver of the 11% growth in Premium Banking. In Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs, revenues were up 1% or 4% if adjusted for the aforementioned foregone revenues. Improved performance mainly in Europe was partially offset by continued slower business momentum in APAC. Turning to costs; noninterest expenses were up 26% mainly attributable to an increase in nonoperating expenses reflecting restructuring and severances provisions related to strategy execution as well as provisions for individual litigation cases, whereas the prior year quarter benefitted from net provision releases. Adjusted costs increased by 5%, mainly reflecting investments in infrastructure control improvements and strategic initiatives. Inflation impacts were largely mitigated by efficiency initiatives. Profits and key ratios in the quarter were impacted by total of \u20ac254 million of nonoperating expenses. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac147 million, or 22 basis points of average loans in the quarter, which reflects the continued stability of our high-quality loan book, especially in the retail businesses, and continued risk discipline. Provision for credit losses in the prior year quarter benefitted from releases of credit loss allowances following sales of non-performing loans. The significant sequential decline reflects a non-recurrence of certain idiosyncratic events in the International Private Bank in the first quarter. We saw solid net inflows in assets under management of \u20ac7 billion in the quarter with \u20ac4 billion in investment products and \u20ac3 billion in AuM deposits. Let me continue with Asset Management on Slide 17. As you will have seen in their report, DWS reported stable revenues despite the effect of weaker markets in 2022 and slightly lower adjusted profit before tax compared to the prior year. My usual reminder: the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Assets under management increased to \u20ac859 billion in the quarter, reflecting \u20ac11 billion of market appreciation and \u20ac9 billion of net inflows. Net inflows were primarily in Passive and Alternatives, notably in Real Estate. Flows in cash products once again have been significant and very volatile throughout the quarter ending with net outflows of \u20ac1 billion. Revenues declined by 6% versus the prior year. This was predominantly driven by higher funding charges in the segment and a decline in management fees from a reduction in average assets under management. Performance and transaction fees were significantly higher year-on-year driven by the Alternatives business. Other revenues declined due to higher funding charges and lower mark-to-market valuations of co-investments, partly offset by net interest income on excess cash from rising interest rates. Noninterest expenses were slightly higher, with adjusted costs remaining essentially flat. Compensation costs were slightly higher driven by variable retention costs and hiring to support transformation and business growth. General and administrative costs were also slightly higher, reflecting higher banking services costs and transformation implementation, mostly offset by a decline in group support costs. Nonoperating costs are significantly higher than the prior year, from an increase in litigation costs. Profit before tax of \u20ac103 million in the quarter was down 34% compared to the prior year. The cost-income ratio for the quarter was 76% and return on tangible equity was 12%. Moving to Corporate & Other on Slide 18; Corporate & Other reported a pre-tax loss of \u20ac115 million this quarter, a substantial improvement versus the pre-tax loss of \u20ac500 million in the second quarter of 2022 on the same basis. This year-on-year improvement was driven to a large part by valuation and timing differences, which were positive \u20ac252 million this quarter. As a reminder, valuation and timing differences arise on derivatives used to hedge the economic risk of the Group\u2019s balance sheet. These are accounting impacts, and the current period gains partially reflect reversals of prior period valuation losses, as the underlying instruments approach maturity. The pre-tax loss associated with our legacy portfolios was \u20ac170 million, versus negative \u20ac120 million in the prior year quarter, driven by additional litigation provisions relating to Polish foreign currency mortgages. Expenses associated with shareholder activities, as defined in the OECD Transfer Pricing guidelines, were \u20ac138 million in this quarter, compared to \u20ac120 million in the prior year quarter. Funding and liquidity impacts were negative \u20ac10 million in the current quarter, compared to negative \u20ac126 million in the prior year quarter. The reversal of non-controlling interests in the operating businesses, primarily from DWS, was positive \u20ac51 million, broadly flat year-on-year. Other impacts reported in the segment aggregated to negative \u20ac100 million. Risk-weighted assets stood at \u20ac41 billion at the end of the second quarter, down \u20ac2 billion since the first quarter of 2023. The RWA figure includes \u20ac19 billion of operational risk RWA. Turning to the Group outlook for the full year on Slide 19; with first half revenues above \u20ac15 billion, we believe that revenues above the mid-point of our guidance range of \u20ac28 billion to \u20ac29 billion for the full year 2023 are achievable. We continue to execute on our agenda to foster the bank\u2019s growth ambitions and to improve the bank\u2019s structural efficiency. As Christian outlined, we have a number of measures underway. Adjusted costs for the full year 2023 are still expected to be essentially flat compared to 2022, benefiting from strict cost management, lower Single Resolution Fund charges for the current year as well as a potential restitution payment from a national resolution fund. We now expect noninterest expenses to be slightly higher compared to 2022; this reflects higher-than-anticipated litigation expenses we had in the second quarter and an impact in relation to the Numis transaction, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter. Provision for credit losses is now expected at the upper end of our guidance range of 25 basis points to 30 basis points of average loans, reflecting the current macro backdrop and lower loan balances than initially anticipated. Our capital guidance is unchanged; our second quarter CET1 ratio of 13.8% allows us to absorb roughly 70 basis points of headwinds in the second half reflecting the impacts from model changes, share buybacks and the Numis acquisition. We remain committed to our capital objectives, most importantly the distribution of \u20ac8 billion to shareholders in respect of the financial years 2021 to 2025 and moving up to a 50% payout ratio and as Christian said, part of this plan is the next phase of our share buyback, which will commence next month and will be finalized in the second half of this year. So, the performance and the growth opportunities we seized in the first half of this year strengthen our confidence in the path towards our 2025 targets and our Global Hausbank strategy. With that, let me hand back to Silke and we look forward to your questions.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you. Emma, we are ready to take the first question..\nOperator: [Operator instructions] First question is from the line of Anke Reingen with RBC. Please go ahead.\nAnke Reingen: Yes. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. If you can just start, talk about the revenue outlook. Maybe firstly, big picture, the macro has been pretty weak; growth is slowing, confidence is low, house prices are declining and in light of this environment, where do you actually see opportunities for your revenue growth, especially in the more stable businesses? Where do you see the risks? And then secondly, you're more concrete in terms of the numbers. The revenue guidance went up for the year, but still implies more like \u20ac6.8 billion to \u20ac7 billion per quarter in the second half. And there's obviously seasonality but you overearned in the first half. So how should we think about the jump-off from the second half into 2024? Can you actually grow revenue is in '24 versus '23? Thank you very much.\nChristian Sewing: Good morning, Anke and thank you very much for your question. Let me start and James will potentially add. First of all, on your description on the macro side, I agree, but I think it completely validates that what we have shared with you in the previous calls. We always said that 2023 will be based on a very weak economy, on a kind of a no-growth scenario. I even expect for the end of '23 technical or a very mild recession in Germany potentially also in the US. And that was always an exactly the foundation of our plan. And hence, Anke, there is no negative surprise in the macro economic outlook when it comes to our plan or to the underlying drivers, be it revenues, be it also risk-crossed. And that is also, I think, important, that from a risk point of view, our credit forecast was always built, exactly on that description of the market you just shared with us, and hence, we also don't see any downside to our credit forecast, which James just again reemphasised in his prepared remarks. When it comes to where do we see growth opportunities in particular for the stable business in such an environment, look, I really do believe that the global house bank strategy in particular in the stable business is exactly the right answer. And that's what we feel kind of on a day-to-day basis with our clients. Of course, we are benefiting from the NII and get back to that in a second, but if you think about what kind of discussions and mandates we win with our corporate banking clients around the world when it comes to reorganising their networks, reorganising their supply chains, making sure that we, obviously, then follow up with the cash management systems around the world, as an answer to their reorganised network, then this brings us a lot of new mandates, which, honestly, is even above our expectations. Of course, in this regard, also the most recent upgrades from rating agencies again help us, because whenever we get this obviously, it helps to increase revenues and new clients onboarding. In the private bank, there is a lot of ask, and you see that also in our development in the assets under management on the investment side. I think there we are seeing not only in Germany, but if I look in particular in other European countries in Spain and Italy, we are seeing, as the go-to bank when it comes to investment advice. And this is, if you talk to the clients in this scenario where inflation is still above 5%, where they think about how they secure their pensions. Now with having post bank fully integrated on our Deutsche Bank system, these people think about how to secure the pensions, and that is obviously our chance and opportunity, and that is what we see in the daily business on the investment business. And in the IB, I know that a lot of people are always thinking this is the more volatile business, but I think we shouldn't underestimate also in these days the stability of the financing business in the IB, again, shown in Q2, also year-over-year. I think the future investments we are doing in the O&A business, they will pay off, because we can see that, actually the trough in this business has been passed, and we see from the mandates we are discussing with the clients, that there is clearly an uplift in this business, and therefore I expect rising revenues actually in that business also in Q3, and in the following quarters. And I also think that Q2 has again shown that also in the trading business, we have done quite well and also compared to our peers and that we are actually maintaining or even growing our market share So if I take all this, I think the positioning of the global house bank with 70% of the revenues now coming from the private bank, corporate bank and the asset management, growing assets under management, I really do think we have the right answer in particular for the environment we are experiencing right now. Now coming to the concrete revenue question and not only for '23 or '24, let me give you some more guidance. A, the NII curve is holding up far stronger than we initially planned and I do believe that with regard to our own existing plan, we see positive surprises also in the second half of '23 And I do also think in '24. Let me give you one example in the private bank business, we see a modest three-digit million revenue increase potential in the second half alone versus our own plan and that is mainly coming from NII, but also from the growing assets under management. The assumptions which we had so far in the corporate bank when it comes to the decrease in NII, I would say we are too conservative and I would also predict that going forward, this would be slower than anticipated, it will come down, but it is slower. The growth in investment and other fee income, as I just said, is encouraging. It's not only the assets under management, but you have seen the announcement of relationship business we are doing. For instance with Lufthansa on Miles & More and to be honest, this is not the one-off, this is actually coming more and more as additional mandates. In particular, if I think about how the corporate bank is thriving, these mandates are coming more and more and therefore I really do believe we are building now the platform to grow in non-NII business with all the technology spend, which we did in the corporate bank, but also obviously in the other business. And therefore we did all the investments in O&A and wealth management, also in hiring the people because we see that business will grow, that there is the increased discussions we have with clients in particular in O&A and therefore we stepped up for that. So looking at all of this and with the starting base of \u20ac15 billion of revenues, look, there is clearly upside in the private bank versus our own plan in the second half and to be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if we see the similar number in the private bank in the second half then what we have seen in the first half. I think very stable numbers in the corporate bank, potentially slightly lower because of the NII curve, but again, we have been very conservative in the past, potentially too conservative. Stable asset management and very robust IB was growing O&A revenues. So all this gave us the confidence changed in that we clearly can hint to a higher revenue base than the midpoint of \u20ac28 billion to \u20ac'29 billion. I think we can focus on the \u20ac29 billion number. And if I then look at the businesses we are creating, again in the non-NII, but also actually what we always emphasize here that the real uptick in NII in the private bank is only coming in '24 and '25, honestly, I'm very bullish on the revenue trajectory for '24 and '25. So I think we are exactly rightly placed from a revenue point of view from a positioning and hinted it placed into our half.\nAnke Reingen: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Nicolas Payen with Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.\nNicolas Payen: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two please. The first one would be on cost and could you give us a bit of color regarding how you think about cost for the rest of the year and whether you know the \u20ac1.6 billion to \u20ac1.65 billion of monthly adjusted costs run rate till holds and maybe also in light of the price pressure that we are seeing, how do you manage to strike a balance between cost discipline and investment for growth And which areas are you prioritizing? And the second question will be on CLP, because the same question regarding the outlook for the rest of the year and particularly after the increase in Q2, have you got any concern in any particular areas? Thank you.\nJames von Moltke: Thanks Nicolas. It's James. I'll take both of your questions and Christian may want to add. Look we've talked about the run rate as we -- it gives you a sense of what management is focused on and I think, the past three quarters, we've been able to adhere to the run rate and it's been an area of real focus given both the need to deliver on cost savings measures in order to support that and manage the investments in a phasing that corresponds with the cost takeout that we're -- that we're achieving. So if I think about priorities, look, our priorities on the cost measures are reasonably clear. We laid them out in March of last year and we're building on that and they are focused on particularly technology distribution platform and in private bank in particular, but not exclusively and then infrastructure support, can we make that infrastructure support more efficient and so we're very focused on that and the delivery. In terms of priorities on the business growth side, leave aside control investments for a moment where I do think we're near or at the peak of what is required in order to finish that control remediation agenda. We've been -- we want to be really clear that our focus is on the capital light product areas in the firm and the ability to grow fee and commission income going forward that supports both the return potential of the company and the distribution profile in the future. And those areas, Christians talked about wealth management being one, origination advisory being the second. In the corporate bank, the fee income sources in the corporate bank that go to technology capabilities, but also just growing our client footprint in some areas where we're a leader, I have doc custody for as one example. So we've been focused on those types of investments and I think we're making really good progress. Just going to the run rate, one thing, as much as we're focused on that range, we do see the pressures I've outlined coming towards the end of the year, Numis, as an obvious example, will give us about \u20ac50 million per quarter of additional expense and then the investment we make in front line bankers taking advantage of the opportunity in the marketplace, maybe a little bit more. So, if they're the exit rates per month is perhaps \u20ac25 million more constant FX, that would be a natural place, but I think we're, in essence, we've started to run downhill in terms of the -- our ability to deliver on those cost savings being derisked, if you like, and gaining momentum. The Unity project is one example that is behind us. And as we said in the prepared remarks, now it's about crystallizing the run rate benefits over time, but there are many more similar initiatives that will have a cumulative impact at which point our greater challenge is phasing of growth investments rather than delivery of cost savings. I just want to say one other thing, while we're on the costs, this nonoperating cost area for us, obviously, frustrating to have those exceed, especially those out of our control original planning. So I look to the second half, we would expect at around, say, \u20ac100 million per quarter, the remainder of the restructuring and severance costs that we outlined for the year to come through. Always uncertain on litigation, but clearly, we would hope to do much better going forward than in the most recent quarter. And then finally, one thing to just make you aware of, we alluded to a little bit in our disclosures it's early to talk about specific purchase price adjustments and what have you in the numerous closing process. But our current expectation is that we would impair the goodwill attached to that immediately on closing. So in the fourth quarter, producing about a \u20ac200 million item there also that we would think of as nonoperating. So for your models and awareness. On CLPs, I'll try to be shorter. Look, the guidance takes into account everything we know today. The environment on balance is in line with our expectations. And if I go all the way back to the beginning of the year, maybe even a little better than our expectations. We did have the idiosyncratic items in the first quarter in IPB come through, and that sort of pushed us up in our range. But otherwise, at the, call it, 30 basis points, we think it captures our expectations about the second half. And we see this as a slightly elevated but not a broad deterioration of the credit environment. So we're very comfortable with the guidance there.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Adam Terelak with Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nAdam Terelak: I've got one on capital and one on NII. On capital and capital return, good to see the \u20ac450 million, but I wanted to poke around a little bit beyond that. The pro forma CET1 is 13.1% post your headwinds, your capital generative. So would it be possible for a buyback to another leg to come as soon as the full year results. And then you're clearly highlighting \u20ac8 billion of total capital return through the '22 to '25 plan, of which have really done \u20ac1.75 billion. So just a sense of how quickly you need to accelerate capital return plans in order to get through that full GBP 8 billion, I think it would be really helps to investors. The \u20ac450 million is helpful, but people want to know what's coming beyond that? And then secondly, on NII, you're talking about the long-dated NII tailwind within the private bank. This makes sense given the nature of that business. But can you put some numbers to it? I think there's worries in the market around peak NII, but a sense of what that recurring tailwind in into '24, '25, '26 and even beyond, would look like -- would give us a bit more confidence about your revenue trajectory beyond this year? So a bit more color around volume of hedges or kind of the back book rate on those hedges would really give us a bit more -- some more to play with when we think about the longer-term NII story.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, Adam, for your questions. Let me start with your capital question, and then I hand over to James, with regard to the NII question and some more details beyond the comments I made before. Look, on the capital, first of all, thank you very much for the recognition of the \u20ac450 million. It's, I think, hugely important for management to deliver that what we have promised. And so far, what we have promised we delivered. And therefore, 1 thing is clear, the \u20ac8 billion absolutely stand that is our target. And based how the company evolves, how actually the capital ratio looks like, if I think about the growth. You just heard from James, how committed we are on the cost line and hence to further increase the operating leverage, we have full confidence in delivering the \u20ac8 billion. I think, and we clearly understand that obviously, this should be a continuous trajectory. And therefore, I also said in the prepared remarks, it is clearly our aim to continue that distribution in '24. Now you will understand after we just published our share buyback last night that we won't give you the details for next year because this also always requires a detailed planning. Our planning around starts in September. Then I think we have such a constructive relationship with our regulator that warrants then the next discussion. But looking where we see the firm, it is our clear aim to continue this trajectory in I think we have gone on a pretty nice journey with an annual increase of 50% when it comes to dividend. We did this not only on the dividend side but also on the share buyback. And as we think this is exactly the right approach, one can potentially think that this is the management aim also to do that in '24. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of way forward. But clearly, it's not back-end loaded only in '25. We know what we have to deliver in '24. James?\nJames Von Moltke: And Adam, thank you for the question. There's so much that goes into banks sort of rate hedging and profiles, it is hard to pull out. The hedging on the PB portfolio is longer than than CB and more euro heavy. So that effect will be with us for several years after '24. It's been a while since I've looked at this in this way. But my memory is that, that uplift is sort of between $200 million and $300 million per year for a period of time. So that uplift is considerable just on the rate side. If you've got volumes and sort of a spread dynamic, sort of more active hedging as well as capital benefits and improving unsecured spreads, there's a number of different features that can help support the NII of the group and the businesses over time. So isolating that item, good story. There's a sustainable growth that comes after 24 and actually already in '24, especially in the second half, but it's one of a number of supportive items. Hopefully, that helps give you some color on it.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKian Abouhossein: I just wanted to come back to the costs. So if I understand this correctly, we should think more of a cost run rate per month of \u20ac16.75 billion. That gets me to \u20ac20.1 billion annualized. Is there any other factors that you think we should consider rather than this constant adjustment of the cost base? Can you share that with us as anything else, any curveball that we should think which could impact costs in '24/'25 going forward? And in that context, on a stated cost basis, can you just clarify what we should think of as a run rate severance and litigation expenses? You mentioned numbers in the past, but they might have changed based on the experience in the second quarter. And then the second question I have is regarding the private bank. You're running at a clean cost income around \u20ac76 million, still looks very high, considering how the higher rates have helped you on the NII. And I was thinking how we should think about the cost income development, and in particular cost development absolute in the private bank.\nJames Von Moltke: So thank you, Kian. Yes. 1.675 is not a bad place to think of in terms of exit rate. We'd be pleased to run the company out there over the course of next year. There are always curveballs in the expense world, but we -- and that's what I mean by running downhill, I think that are the tools that we have to manage those curve balls hopefully begin to expand. As we come out of a shrinking control remediation, repairing our technology estate world of call it the past five years and move into a growth and an accelerating benefit from initiatives under way world. Leave FX aside for a second because that'll obviously change the run rate going forward, but otherwise, I'd say inflation is tough, especially on the technology side. So how much inflation flows through. Again, I want to be clear because we have so much coming on the expense initiative side, it would then give us the flexibility to phase and time some of the investments in a way that gives us control and allows us to manage that. Obviously, we'd like to make the investments and investments that are high return low marginal cost income ratio is the direction of travel, but that gives us sort of additional levers. Litigation, sevens and instruction, obviously, the second is in our control. We would probably tell you that a typical severance year, if nothing else is going on, is maybe 100, 150 per year. So not gigantic and it really just depends on whether there are larger programs that we initiate and then put aside, but obviously, we'd like to get to the end of a period of time where major initiatives are necessary as part of the transformation of the company. And then on litigation, that's been hard to estimate and in fairness, there've been items that have taken us by surprise, both last year with the third party messaging, as an example, in this most recent quarter with a number of items. One always has the view that as you get through items, they're behind you, you've taken out the risk, and then, therefore, the forward list of matters begins to diminish, but it's -- and the run rate there, therefore, is hard to define properly, but we'd love for that to be sub-400 in a year, let alone in a quarter. On private bank, Christian will want to, want to add, but the operating leverage in private bank will be, we think, dramatic over the years ahead, and that's really the story there.\nChristian Sewing: Yeah. So, well, you took my words, because, here, and I think you are right, obviously, we are not yet happy with the cost income ratio we have in the private bank, but if you see only on the cost side, what is still to come, just because of the finalization now of Unity, \u20ac300 million of costs will fall away in '25. We have branch closures further to come, I think, in the last quarter, or in the last two quarters, we close approximately 90 branches or 100 branches. That goes on, this is continuing. You have seen our announcement on the mortgage side that we are actually reducing, reducing there also, our people in that business as a consequence of our business mix and the capital allocation. So, I think on the cost side in the private bank, if I also look at all the key deliverables under Rebecca's wing, where she is now working with Claudio de Sanctis on, there is a clear cost take out on itself, and I haven't even touched now on the revenue side. On the revenue side, actually clear upside, I just gave you a little bit of number for the second half of 2023. This is not extraordinary income. This is just better revenues that we initially planned, that will continue also when I look at the plan in the year '24 and '25, also on the back of the NII comments, James made earlier, and all that brings us actually into a cost income range for the private bank, which is in the low 60s, and that in 2025, that is our plan, and we feel exactly on that trajectory. And I do also think with the announcements, Claudio made on making the structure now, after building up the private bank internationally and private in Germany under cards leadership now moving it together there is additional costs which we actually take out. So therefore, I'm absolutely confident that we can achieve this low 60s cost/income ratio than in '25.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Stuart Graham with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nStuart Graham: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had a couple, please, a geeky question on your CRE exposures. So thank you for the extra information in the interim report. You now talk about non-recourse loans of \u20ac40 billion, but I think that's a different definition to the \u20ac33 billion you talked about at the Q1 stage. So my question is, why the change in definition and what is the like for likes to go to the \u20ac33 billion at Q1? And then secondly, you talk about an additional \u20ac800 million a stress pad that provisions for CRE, but presumably some of that's already captured in your basic provisioning guidance, given the current provisioning run rate of \u20ac100 million a quarter for CRE. So how much of that \u20ac800 million is incremental stress provisioning, not captured in your current guidance, please? Thank you.\nJames von Moltke: Yeah, on the second question, great question, probably around \u20ac500 of the eight, not in. So we, and it depends by the way, Stuart, on the timeframe you choose. So over this year and next, we would expect another, a few hundred million of total provisions to come in and therefore, I would say about \u20ac500 million incremental. We had been working hard on that disclosure, and also to your question about definitions, what we were trying to clean up this is two things. One is the NACE code disclosure, which is a is an industry definition, but to be fair, not really how we think about risk managing the portfolio. And therefore, we wanted to bridge from the NACE at around $40 billion within the NACE definition, there is nonrecourse and recourse.. Ironically there's also some non-recourse outside of the nase definition in these numbers. So we're trying to give you, sort of reconcile if you like to some of the existing external disclosures. What I think is important though, is this, kind of the \u20ac33 billion of the old focus portfolio, the \u20ac34 billion of the new focus portfolio, what we're trying to give you is a sense of the size of the perimeter that is our focus from a risk management perspective, where we think, what is the portfolio that can produce losses based on its exposure to the current environment, that's a little bit different today than it was in the COVID time when we first created the focus portfolio, and so hence also a shift to that, but not a meaningful, difference in, in terms of total exposures. So that's hopefully some color Stuart to help you understand what we were -- what we were trying to do for you in that disclosure.\nStuart Graham: So I should basically forget the \u20ac33 billion been and just focus on the new disclosure, yeah.\nChristian Sewing: I would -- look, the problem with the pillar three is often that the industry disclosures in the pillar three is really tough to draw meaningful conclusions from. So yeah, short answer is trust us that we're doing our very best to show you the portfolio that we are focused on risk managing in those disclosures.\nJames von Moltke: And Stuart, I cannot help much ourselves as a former risk manager to comment on that because A, the down side, which we now included with the \u20ac800 million, is obviously something which is over multiple years. It's not only this year and next year. So it's a real downside to spread over multiple years, and therefore, I don't want that this is now taken in any wrong context and you think this is a hidden way to increase our base case, not at all, but we feel that transparency may even help you to see how strong this portfolio is.\nStuart Graham: That's helpful. Thank you for the extra transparency. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you. I've got a couple of questions on capital, please. The first one is, you mentioned that you've now got very friendly relations with ECB and I think it's a nice positive surprise that you've got this approval. Perhaps earlier than we were expecting, it didn't have to wait for you to print the 1H numbers, you've already got the approval. And I just wondered if you could talk about what's changed in that regulatory relationship because obviously you're in a tough situation at the start of the year when you couldn't do the buyback that you wanted. And I just wondered what the main changes, whether it's sort of visibility on your headwinds or other factors, so sort of what has changed in that regulatory context and these approvals being so forthcoming now? And then my second question, also on capital, I just wanted if you had any perspectives on the US Basel III finalization that's coming through and just how that might impact you, either in your -- does it impact your local US business or do you already have such a high CET1 ratio there that it's not particularly affected, does it affect competitive position for the group in the U.S. or elsewhere? Does it create pressure for Europe to tighten up its implementation of Basel III finalization? Any views on that would be really interesting.\nChristian Sewing: Yeah, Jeremy, let me start and I hate to correct you, but I think I said very constructive. So I must be careful and don't want to say friendly because that may be even taken wrong then. So we have a very constructive relationship with our regulator and that should be always the case. Look what changed and James may want to add for this, I think actually nothing really changed because we ourselves at the beginning of the year as we always said in November and December says we want to wait how 23 is starting, how the economy is actually developing. We would like to see how the first quarter is developing. And we -- as we now can say, we didn't actually apply for a share buyback at that point in time because we wanted to see what is going on in this world. Volatility was around. We have the geopolitical uncertainties. We had an inflation. The economic forecast were everything between a hard recession and actually a growth scenario. And therefore, I think, rightly so, also with all that, what we could see, James decided and with my full support that we, for the time being hold off. And then we started well into the year. We had a far better forecast what is happening. We saw how stable the business is developing. And we saw we are making good progress. And that was the right time then also with the forecast into '23 and '24 to apply for that. And in this regard, I think we had very constructive discussions. And this is my own assumption and only interpretation. I do think that the regulator also actually recognized that we were on the cautious side at the end of 2022 when it came to the start of '23. And I think that also then obviously was at least not taken negatively.\nJames von Moltke: And Jeremy, just to add that the timing and magnitude of the reg changes is something that they and we have more visibility into as timing went on as the model and methodology changes. So that was helpful in terms of giving us greater confidence in in that capital plan. I think the step off now in Q2 helps to support that further. And of course, that was -- the progress during the year was visible to them through the year. On U.S. Basel III final framework, obviously, very curious to see what's in it. I don't think it really impacts us in a meaningful way. in terms of our business operations, potentially competitive positioning, given that, in our view, European banks have been at a capital disadvantage for some time. And then there's also at least the possibility that the timing of implementation could give us a bit more breathing room relative to the first of January 25. But beyond that, not much expected. I would not expect that the European legislator sort of reopens its discussions based on whatever they read in the NPR. And I think that's appropriate. Where Europe should decide for itself what the appropriate legislation and implementation looks like.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Timo Dums with DZ Bank. Please go ahead.\nTimo Dums: I would like to address two strategic topics, please. So one is on PB and one on the Misono deal. So starting with there has been a reshuffling under the new leadership with Claude DeSantis taking over. So when do you plan to communicate further details on -- if you could share any further details give some color there? And would you also considering, for instance, streamlining the different brands that you are working with in PB. So that would be question number one. And then on the Miles & More deal, congratulations on this one. So maybe you could outline the major drivers here why you have been chosen? And what may have changed here in that respect compared with some years ago and maybe could you discuss also the general attractiveness of this co-branded card business? Some of your competitors they pulled away from the sort of business in the last two years.\nChristian Sewing: Well, thank you, Timo. On the PB side, look, Claudio started 245 days ago. And let me -- let me start differently. First of all, I think Karl has done a wonderful job in actually making sure that the private banking business is becoming a profitable business. He has done a lot in order to make sure that we are on the trajectory to become a very profitable business, as we said also to Kian's question. So the trajectory, which Karl has laid is exactly the right one. Now what we will see actually in the private banking business is actually that the international private banking business and the German private banking business is moving closer together from a product responsibility from an investment responsibility also from an infrastructure and servicing responsibility. So you will see a more leaner structure, which we now can do after we have done the necessary steps in Germany with Unity. We can now actually put it under a more combined and efficient leadership together, which obviously will bring certain cost benefits. On top of that, I do believe that Claudio will focus very much across the private banking business on the investment arm on the capital LiDAR. You have seen that he has done that very successfully in the international private bank. And I do believe if I look at the long-term challenges in particular in Germany, if you really think about what the people are concerned about -- it's about the pensions. It's about the state pensions, which will come or not come in 10 or 15 years. And in this regard, there is in almost each and every client meeting, there is a question how can I actually plan for my own retirement in that time period. And for that, you need a first-class offering on the investment side. And that's exactly where you need the private banking experience, private banking expertise we have with Claudio, which we have with a lot of other people. And that's, I think, where Claudio is very much focusing on. Secondly, he would make sure that also this offering in a digital way will make its way to 15 million clients now all on the same IT platform that is really a meaningful step forward. So I'm very proud of what happened with Unity. So I do think the power, which we can now bring particular in the investment business to Deutsche Bank clients, but in particular, to 15 million post bank clients being now part of our technology, is simply outstanding, and Claudio will focus on that. On the miles and more, look, I haven't seen, by the way, from the competition and also from the deal in itself that the competition was not interested anymore in such a deal. That was a real race. We are super proud that we were able to be selected by Miles & More and by Lufthansa made the difference. At the end of the day, our clients can far better talk about that. I will not talk about that, the client took a decision. But I do believe that our shift four years ago that the corporate bank, the day-to-day business, the combination, the client centricity, which we have built between the private bank, the corporate bank, the way these two units work together and worked in that pitch made it different. We delivered on Deutsche Bank to Lufthansa. And one Deutsche Bank to Lufthansa is not only the best platform for miles more and the best technology, which, by the way, we started to invest already last year in order to be ready now to really do the migration. What we deliver to them is 15 million additional potential clients and that nobody else has and with the commitment of the full Board that the private bank and the corporate bank is as much as the heart of the Deutsche Bank business as our focused investment bank, I think the clients get it, and they want them to work with us. And I think that is the advantage which we can deliver. And I can tell you that is only the start because with that mandate, we will, I think, have a big, big chance to win other card businesses in Germany and in Europe.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Lim: I've got three, if I may. So the first one on capital. Could you update us on the impact you'll probably see from final Basel III rules. I think the met latest guidance was for risk-weight inflation of about \u20ac30 billion. But if I'm not mistaken, that excludes the impact of the output floor. So maybe you could also give us additionally what that impact might be from the output floor. And then on Slide 9 of the presentation on net interest margin. I see that your average interest earning assets have been declining for a few quarters here. You've pointed to lower cash balances as a cause for Q2. But is there something a bit more persistent going on in terms of maybe high interest rates denting demand for loans or maybe also the contribution from the reduction in sub hurdle lending, maybe that has a larger impact here. So if you could talk about that in a bit more detail. And then the third question is a bit more technical. So you've got EPS of only \u20ac0.19 here. So I'm trying to reconcile the net profit that you've used to calculate this, it's only \u20ac402 million, which is a lot lower than the \u20ac763 million. So I'm trying to understand how you get to the 402 million. Both of these measures include the deduction of 81 coupons. So is there some other OCI impacts here to get to the 402 -- or \u20ac763 million.\nJames Von Moltke: So Andrew, I just -- I'm not sure exactly what you were talking about in those last numbers. So we may need to clarify the area that you were at. On the capital impact, I'd say we would probably stick with the -- with our earlier commentary, which I think was 10%, but it's been a while since we've looked at that incremental of the output floor then between 25% and 30%. And in fairness, that's all premitigation, business model changes and all that good stuff. So it's there's no update on that, but that would be orders of magnitude. And I think important to emphasize the capital measures that we talked about in April, I mean you can ask where they intended to support offsetting Basel III impact or to support the distribution same, same. They're really, I think, valuable in both respects to and to shift the group to more capital-light usage of the balance sheet. It goes a little bit to your NIM or interest-earning assets question. I'd be surprised if the next number in the series were as big as of a downward movement as the last albeit loan growth has clearly slowed down, and you're seeing the impact now of some of the decisions we announced in April around trade finance and lending as well as the mortgage book. So we would expect to see some impact in the loan balances as a consequence but we think that, that's the right decision economically in terms of supporting both ROTE and NIM going forward. And maybe I just -- I want to make sure I understand the reconciliation that you're referring to in terms of the -- was it a forward on capital that you were after? Or -- I wasn't sure.\nAndrew Lim: Sorry. Okay. If I could clarify further. So on the supplementary disclosures on Page 21. So you give the net profit there of \u20ac402 million to calculate your EPS of \u20ac0.19. So that \u20ac0.19 obviously is a lot lower than last quarter of \u20ac0.63. So I'm trying to understand how you get to that \u20ac402 million because on Slide 15, you've got net profit of \u20ac763 million. So there's a big down shift here in the net profit. And I can't quite figure out how you get to that 402 million. There doesn't seem to be any kind of disclosure there? So that's on the EPS side.\nJames Von Moltke: Yes. I don't think there's a mystery. I think it's just -- we've got about \u20ac2 billion and change shares outstanding. So it looks to me to be proportional to the number, but we'll -- we can quadruple check and come back to you. Again, we obviously have to take out in an EPS calculation, we take out all of the earnings, if you like, that go to other capital providers, whether that's been our minority interest or AT1 holders.\nAndrew Lim: Yes, sure, I completely agree. I mean it seems like those two lines are exactly the same, except for Q2 where suddenly it's different. I mean it seems like you're deducting everything like AT1 coupons, for example, and also minority interest. So Pat, I can [nible] up with you?\nJames Von Moltke: Yes, we can follow up on that.\nAndrew Lim: Okay. Great. And then sorry, no guidance on the output floor then. Is that something we have to wait for later on, I guess?\nJames Von Moltke: That was the first part. It was a ballpark of 10% but over several years with a lot still to kind of to go in terms of how we shift the balance sheet in order to mitigate what we can in that output floor impact.\nAndrew Lim: The 10% increase in total RWAs.\nJames Von Moltke: Exactly. And that was a denominator that was closer to \u20ac300 million, maybe \u20ac330 million than to \u20ac350 million or even \u20ac400 million well will be by that time. So you have to go back several years to the point where we gave you a percentage there.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Vishal Shah with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nVishal Shah: I had two questions. The first one was on capital returns. So clearly, with the new buyback announced, your distributions are now \u20ac1.75 billion and the remaining is \u20ac6.25 billion to that \u20ac8 billion total target. So if I take your 50% payout policy, you would need to generate about $13 billion plus in net income over the next two years. And then this is much higher versus consensus at about \u20ac9 billion right now combined for '24 and '25. So I'm wondering how -- what are the key drivers you're looking at to bridge that gap. So that's one. And then the second 1 is on your investment banking business. So you have clearly hired a lot on the front office side there. in both banking and capital markets, plus there's a demo deal that is underway too. So clearly, you're positioning for a potential rebound in banking and capital markets activity. So what I wanted to check there is if you have a target market share in mind in terms of what you -- where you want to see your banking business versus the global peers? Or with the recent hiring of the Numis deal, do you think you are rightsized from a staffing perspective at least for now? That's about it.\nJames Von Moltke: So Vishal, yes, on the first item, you're probably just missing a year. So we -- it's a little bit complex the way we do it, but we've said in respect of the years '21 to '25, paid in the years '22 and this would include a little bit of capital then returned in -- or a lot of capital returned in '26. So we think our -- on the trajectory that we're on, which you remember is sort of asymptotic if you go 50% per year, the increase is quite steep, and we think also prudent in light of our own view of the earnings growth potential of DB. On the IB item, and I'll focus now on origination and advisory, where the investments have been going they'd be more visible perhaps there have been investments into the FIC platform, which we think have performed very nicely in terms of our market share improvements from a low point in '18 and '19 to where we are today. We're very pleased with that progression. But in the corporate finance area where we've invested more recently, our market share has been bouncing around 2%. And we do think there's a significant opportunity for us there. We don't have a specific target, but I don't think there's any reason why we shouldn't be able to double the market share in -- again, with our in a disciplined way inside our client footprint inside our capital footprint. But by doing just much better in terms of closing industry gaps in terms of building more of the chain, for example, with private equity sponsors, both on the way in and the way out. There's a lot of potential that is, if you like, within our franchise perimeter that we really just haven't captured. So lots of upside for us there, I believe.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Tom Hallett with KBW. Please go ahead.\nTom Hallett: Just a quick one. I've noticed you both in recent weeks have increased your confidence in the trading activity to pick up in the second half of the year. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate on that because -- the second quarter was actually pretty strong. And last year prior periods were also very strong on a relative basis. So yes, I would just like to know what gives you that confidence. Is it just a simple kind of maybe the credit side of things or increasing a little bit more into the back end of the year?\nJames Von Moltke: Yes. So Tom, first of all, the comparative that we've got for the fourth quarter isn't very demanding. So I do think there's just in that, there's a real opportunity to take the year-on-year in revenue up significantly. I think we're in an interesting time. We've talked about the macro weakening in lower volatility, and you've started to see that against a high base and one where we think we're executing well in terms of our client engagement. But in the language I've been using the micro coming back, especially credit and financing businesses and doing quite well. An interesting question, is there an environment in which the credit stays that continues to do well in the second half and going into '24. But because we find ourselves now on the other side of the cycle, increasing volatility as investors now begin to position for an uncertain path in terms of reducing policy rates and an uncertain path in terms of the length of time the policy rates stay at the terminal rate. So there's sort of an interesting environment that we see coming in the second half of the year. We'll see whether that comes to fruition or not. But what we -- what we're -- on Mac and his team, super focused on is just engaging with our clients so that we can participate both in the flow side of that activity as well as the structure. And I think they've done a fabulous job at that. And the second quarter is a good is a good indication of how we can perform in that market or maybe a slightly better backdrop.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Mate Nemes with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMate Nemes: I have two questions, please. The first one is on capital. I was just wondering if you could give us a rundown of the moving parts on the CET1 ratio in the second half of the year. I know that you communicated a 70 basis point impact from Numis deal closing the share buyback and some of the regulatory melanges. I think Christian mentioned securitization and reduction in software lending potentially resulting also in some RB reduction. Could you perhaps quantify that? The second question is on the corporate bank. Obviously, the loan book declined about 4% quarter-on-quarter. I know sold down is intentional and coming from risk management and perhaps some impact of some current lending. But I'm just wondering to what extent do you see future demand? Is that entirely driven by you? And if so, when do you expect the turnaround on that front?\nJames Von Moltke: Sure. Thank you, M\u00e1t\u00e9. So briefly, the 70 basis points is still -- we're still thinking 50 basis points of model methodology adjustments there's a range around that. And then 9 basis points for Numis, 12 basis points for the capital return. The other moving parts are organic capital generation and how much we use in terms of balance sheet growth, that should produce a year-end ratio probably higher than our original guidance for the year. So we'd like to -- we'd probably be closer to or further into the 13s, let's say, than just the 200 basis points margin to MDA, which would be $13.2 million. Within that, we do have embedded some assumptions about what additional support we can get from securitizations, optimization and other of the capital measures. Look, we -- I think if we outperform those assumptions or our own execution sort of path, that puts us in an even better position going into both for distribution and for the Basel III build. So those are some of the moving parts that we see.\nChristian Sewing: Yes. And on your second question, I think your kind of differentiation is the right one. Some of the lower loan growth or even decline is intentionally, by the way, not only from a risk management point of view because we have actually a very conservative and long-standing risk appetite, and therefore, we don't need to do so many adjustments in between. But of course, also we have sub hurdle relationships where we -- and we said that in April, where we want to go for an even better and more focused risk return strategy, and that's what we are doing. So that is one part. And secondly, yes, I think in particular, in Europe but also in Germany, you see that mid-cap companies, family-owned companies that you see a softening in loan growth and the reduction in demand for the time being, in particular, when it comes to long-term investments. To be honest, I don't think that this is something which is continuing for a very long period. But I would say that those companies would like to see where the next 6 to 12 months are going. And therefore, I would say this rather soft loan growth is something which we will see in the second half of '23, which is part of our planning and also which goes into the first half year of 24%. Nevertheless, and therefore, again, it is so important that we build the corporate bank on various engines. And the other engines are the fee income, our cash management mandates. The card business I was just talking about before. And that actually gives us all the confidence that even with the softening demand, which in my view is only temporary and will come back we can actually compensate that with fee business, and that is the reason why we invested into that so much.\nOperator: The last question is from the line of Amit Goel with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nAmit Goel: Yes. Two questions. One, just coming back on the asset quality. I think, obviously, that's the commentary about there's no sign of persistent deterioration, although there was some softening in German mid-cap sectors, including automotive. I was just kind of curious what gives you the confidence that it's not persistent deterioration and/or are you changing any behavior or your credit that you provide into that space? And then secondly, just -- I guess, just to help my understanding. But in terms of pass-through rates, so for the NIM. What are the factors that are kind of driving the lower pass-through rates. I appreciate maybe there's some conservative assumptions. But what are the things that you think will drive changes or kind of increase in pass-through as we kind of go through time. So just curious what are the factors that you think are influencing pass-through at the moment and into the second half of the year.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you for your questions. Let me start on the asset quality because I'm also in a lot of client contact actually also in Germany, obviously. A, I really do believe, and I said it again and again, but the resilience of the family-owned companies and the mid-cap companies in Germany is bigger than a lot of people think. If I think about how they actually improved from the 2008 global financial crisis, if you think about how they actually increased capital, how they improve their working capital systems, their liquidity. This is a completely different picture than it was 15 years ago. And I'm saying it because they go with a different buffer into the situation which we have right now. And that's also what we are seeing not only in our portfolio. But if you actually look at the overall statistics, there is no such thing like a material deterioration in the credit worthiness of the German mid-cap companies. Now what is then specifically on us, and I do believe even go further back to Deutsche Bank's history in 2002 and 2003 when we actually had too many credit losses in that area. We completely changed the way we are managing credit risk also for medium and family-owned corporates when it comes to concentration risk when it comes to differentiating between, sort of, say, winners and potential companies which are more challenged in certain industries, we have a clear industry view and not only the specific company view. And by that, I think our risk management to the individual review of corporate is simply a superior one. And I personally just went last week through the -- for instance, the OEM suppliers in Germany. If I look at the portfolio, how diversified we are from a rating point of view, from a concentration risk point of view, i.e., that there are no big concentration risk. If we have larger risk, it's actually with investment-grade companies, who are actually themselves diversified globally in their business, then I do believe that there may be a little bit of deterioration in that portfolio, but I can't see that we are coming into a situation where I would see a material deterioration of our mid-cap portfolio. So looking at their own resilience and the way we have risk managed that, I'm confident that, obviously, our portfolio is in good health. James?\nJames Von Moltke: So on pass-through, it's an interesting topic. And in some ways, it's going to be too early to tell. So we'll all sort of do the analysis of this cycle once it's over. I think a few things. One, I think the dollar -- it's different by currency. I think the dollar has started to converge perhaps not to model but to a place that looks to us to potentially be where things settle out, a little bit better than the models would have expected. The euro is still well behind. What's driving that? I think there's discipline -- pricing discipline in the industry. I think there's an element of this cycle is different because of how sharp and how steep and how fast it was. I think there's an element that the banking industry had a long time of negative and is seeking to recover some of that sort of lost structural profitability. And I think client behavior is also a piece of the puzzle here. Obviously, there -- especially the more you go to wholesale money, they're smart enough to move their money to places that it earns a higher yield and -- but then they also know they need to leave a certain amount of money with the banks, and they understand that the remuneration of that for payments and operational purposes. And I understand that remuneration for that money is -- doesn't follow the market because there are services attached to it. So I think that's an understanding of the business model that's maybe better than it has been in the past. So lots of different drivers we'll need to unpack in time, but one that I think is overall a bullish sign for the industry of the value that banks, frankly, are providing to their clients, not just in corporate and middle market but also in the retail space.\nUnidentified Company Representative: So thank you very much for your interest and questions.

        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Thank you, Silke, and a warm welcome also from my side. It\u2019s a pleasure to be discussing our second quarter and first half results with you today. These results provide a vital perspective of the progress we are making towards our objectives. For me, a few key points stand out. First, we have strong growth momentum. Revenues in the first half year were up 8% to \u20ac15.1 billion, putting the upper end of our guidance range of \u20ac28 billion to \u20ac29 billion within reach. We also captured net inflows of \u20ac28 billion across the Private Bank and Asset Management. We are reaping the benefits of a complementary and well-balanced earnings mix. We are delivering strong growth in our Private Bank and Corporate Bank franchises, and resilience in key areas of our Investment Bank. Second, we have proven our earnings power. We generated profit before tax of \u20ac3.3 billion in the first six months, up 2% over last year and the highest first half since 2011, after absorbing more than \u20ac700 million in non-operating costs, including restructuring related to operational efficiencies. Excluding these non-operating costs, pre-tax profit would have been \u20ac4 billion, 21% higher than in the first half of 2022 on a comparable basis. Our post-tax RoTE was 6.8%, and would have been above 9%, excluding non-operating costs and with bank levies apportioned equally across the year; very close to our 2025 target, of above 10%. Third, our balance sheet and capital position are resilient. Our CET1 ratio has risen to 13.8%, driven by strong organic capital generation. We have sound liquidity and a solid deposit base, which we slightly increased in the second quarter. Fourth: we are delivering on our promise to distribute capital to shareholders. As announced yesterday evening, we have received supervisory approval to start share buybacks of up to \u20ac450 million, 50% higher than last year. Together with the dividend we paid in respect of 2022, we aim to distribute more than \u20ac1 billion of capital to shareholders this year. This will bring total distributions across 2022 and 2023 to around \u20ac1.75 billion and of course, it is our clear aim to continue on that trajectory in 2024 as part of our \u20ac8 billion distribution promise. Fifth: we are accelerating the execution of our Global Hausbank strategy. We are already making good progress in driving operational efficiency, boosting capital efficiency, and outperforming our revenue growth target. Let me now discuss the franchise strength across our businesses in the first half year, on Slide 2. Starting with the Corporate Bank; we delivered 30% revenue growth with strong momentum across all business areas. With noninterest expenses up 6%, operating leverage in this business was 24% in the first half of 2023. That enabled us to deliver an RoTE of nearly 17%. In the Investment Bank; we demonstrated the stability of our Financing business and resilience of our FIC franchise overall, after the exceptionally strong levels of the same period of last year and we are further diversifying our Investment Bank by strengthening our O&A business, both organically and inorganically. We announced the acquisition of Numis and seized opportunities to add revenue generators through selective hiring. Turning to the Private Bank; we grew revenues by 10% in the first half of 2023. These are the best six month revenues since the formation of the Private Bank, with double-digit year-on-year growth in both the first and second quarters of the year. We also generated net inflows of \u20ac13 billion in the first half year. This helped us grow Assets under Management by \u20ac23 billion, to \u20ac541 billion, during the first six months of 2023. Finally, we also grew volumes in Asset Management. We captured net asset inflows of \u20ac15 billion, or \u20ac19 billion ex-Cash, driven by Passive and Alternatives, both focus areas for us. That enabled us to grow assets under management by \u20ac38 billion euros, to \u20ac859 billion in the first half year and these businesses are strongly complementary, which drives sustained revenue growth as we show on slide three. Over the past two years, we have seen steady growth in first-half revenues. We see ourselves well on track to deliver at the higher end of our full-year guidance of \u20ac28 billion to \u20ac29 billion. We achieved this despite significant shifts in the operating environment over the past 24 months, as a strong post-COVID recovery in 2021 gave way to inflationary headwinds and economic uncertainties driven by the war in Ukraine. We maintained our growth trajectory in a changing environment; thanks, in good measure, to a complementary business portfolio. As mentioned, we delivered strong revenue growth in our Corporate and Private Banks, which took full advantage of rising interest rates and new client mandates. We expect that momentum to continue into the second half of 2023. This, together with the stable contribution from the Investment Bank\u2019s Financing business, more than offset normalizing conditions in our more market-sensitive businesses. That reflects a well-balanced revenue mix in line with our Global Hausbank ambition. As we anticipate some normalization of interest rates, we aim to further complement our earnings mix. We are making investments in \u2018capital light\u2019 businesses, including Origination & Advisory and Wealth Management, together with technology-enabled high-return businesses in the Corporate Bank. Finally: across all business, we continue to make progress towards our sustainability targets. We added ESG financing and investment volumes of \u20ac17 billion in the second quarter, bringing our cumulative total to \u20ac254 billion since January 2020. And our business growth has further increased our underlying earnings power, as we set out on Slide 4. As I said earlier, our first-half profit before tax, of \u20ac3.3 billion, was up 2% compared to the first half of 2022, and as you can see, pre-provision profit was up 8% at \u20ac4 billion, after absorbing significantly higher non-operating costs than in the prior year. Non-operating costs were \u20ac744 million, comprising litigation charges to settle mainly longstanding matters and restructuring and severance as we realise operational efficiencies. Revenues were up 8%, while adjusted costs, which exclude non-operating items, were up only 2%, below inflation, despite continued investments in our platform. And with pro-rated bank levies, adjusted operating leverage was 5%. This earnings power is reflected in the progress we are making on our key target ratios. Post-tax RoTE, excluding non-operating costs and with bank levies apportioned equally over the four quarters of the year, would be over 9% in the first half of 2023, while our cost-income ratio would be 67%. In other words; we\u2019re on a clear path towards achieving our 2025 targets. Before I hand over to James, a few words on the progress we\u2019re making to accelerate delivery of our Global Hausbank strategy, as we discussed with you in April, on Slide 5. We aim to accelerate delivery on three dimensions: operational efficiency, capital efficiency, and revenue growth, where we aim to outperform our original targets. We have already made progress in all of these. Turning first to operational efficiencies; we raised our ambition for incremental efficiencies from \u20ac2 billion to \u20ac2.5 billion, as we said. We have already delivered more than \u20ac600 million, through a range of measures such as branch closures in the Private Bank, standardizing loan processing in the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank and simplifying our technology infrastructure. We anticipate \u20ac300 million of savings by 2025 from the successfully completed migration of 12 million Postbank clients onto the Deutsche Bank technology platform and we expect more than \u20ac100 million from the announced redundancies in senior non-client facing roles as more than 80% of affected staff have either been informed or left the platform. In other words, a total of around \u20ac1 billion in savings are either already achieved, or are expected from measures now implemented. We have a series of other measures in flight; for example, streamlining our mortgage business and further branch closures in the Private Bank, reengineering more front-to-back processes in the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank, further application de-commissioning, and additional workforce measures. These are some examples of a wider programme of initiatives underway. Based on our progress on these, and realized achievements so far, we reaffirm our \u20ac2.5 billion goal. In respect of capital efficiencies: as you know, our aim is to reduce risk weighted assets by \u20ac15 billion to \u20ac20 billion by 2025 relative to our baseline assumptions with a modest revenue impact. In the second quarter, we accelerated securitisation transactions, which delivered RWA relief of around \u20ac3 billion. In addition, credit risk RWAs were reduced as part of the Trade Finance and Lending optimization efforts. Overall, we proved our revenue strength with the business delivering revenue growth while our FX adjusted RWAs decreased by \u20ac5 billion compared to the prior year quarter. We have further optimization measures in preparation for the second half of 2023 including securitisation of consumer finance loans and reductions in sub-hurdle lending. All this gives us confidence that we will deliver on our capital optimisation goals. Turning finally to revenue growth; we are fully on track to outperform on our revenue growth targets of 3.5% to 4.5% compound annual growth against 2021 levels. On a last 12-month basis, we delivered compound annual revenue growth versus 2021 of 7.5%, well ahead of that target, with revenue growth of 8% in the first half of this year. We expect the interest rate environment to continue to drive sustainable performance in our stable businesses. We anticipate added momentum from our organic and inorganic investments, including the Numis acquisition or the new partnership with Lufthansa and Miles & More, and from hiring of some 50 senior O&A bankers. This enables us to take advantage of an expected pickup in corporate finance activity. We are already seeing signs of this in our backlog. We have also hired around 30 wealth managers. And we expect the growth in our assets under management, and net asset inflows, to drive fee income in future quarters. To sum up, we are delivering revenue and business growth off a strong franchise. Our well-balanced, complementary business mix enables us to drive continued revenue momentum; we are increasing our earnings power year by year, and we see a clear path to achieving our 2025 profitability targets, amongst others an RoTE of larger than 10% in 2025 and we are delivering on two key promises; distributing \u20ac8 billion to shareholders, and accelerating execution of our Global Hausbank strategy. With that: let me hand over to James."

        "text": "Thank you, Christian. Let me start with a few key performance indicators on slide 7, and place them in the context of our 2025 targets. Christian outlined the strong revenue momentum and our well-balanced business mix which resulted in revenue growth of well above 7% on a compound basis for the last 12 months relative to 2021. This performance puts us well on track to deliver revenue growth above our 2025 target. The strong revenue growth combined with ongoing cost discipline led to a two-percentage point improvement in the cost-income ratio to 73% in the first six months compared to 2022, despite significantly higher non-operating expenses in the second quarter, which we would not expect to repeat in the same magnitude in coming periods. Our capital position has remained strong and our CET1 ratio of 13.8% positions us well for capital distributions, investments and the implementation of regulatory changes. Our liquidity metrics remained strong. The LCR was 137%, above our target of around 130%, and in the second quarter, the net stable funding ratio was 119%. In short, our performance in the period reaffirms our confidence in reaching our 2025 targets. With that, let me turn to the second-quarter highlights on Slide 8. Group revenues were \u20ac7.4 billion, up 11% on the second quarter of 2022. Noninterest expenses were \u20ac5.6 billion, up 15% year-on-year- The increase was largely driven by the \u20ac655 million of non-operating expenses in the quarter, compared to \u20ac102 million in the prior year period. Non-operating expenses this quarter included \u20ac260 million of restructuring and severance provisions to accelerate the execution of our Global Hausbank strategy, primarily through a reduction in non-client facing roles and optimization of our mortgage platform. To settle a number of longstanding litigation matters, we incurred litigation charges of \u20ac395 million as, in each case, the outcome was higher than expected. Adjusted costs increased year-on-year, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac401 million or 33 basis points of average loans. We generated a profit before tax of \u20ac1.4 billion, down 9% year-on-year, mainly due to the higher non-operating items. Net profit of \u20ac900 million was also impacted by the higher effective tax rate, principally reflecting the non-deductibility of certain litigation charges. Our cost income ratio was just under 76% and our post-tax return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity was 5.4% in the quarter. Excluding the aforementioned non-operating expenses, the cost/income ratio would have been 67% and post-tax return on average tangible shareholders\u2019 equity close to 9%. Diluted earnings per share was \u20ac0.19 in the second quarter and tangible book value per share was \u20ac26.95, up 5% year-on-year. Let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results, starting with interest rate developments on Slide 9. Net interest margin in the Private Bank and Corporate Bank remained strong in the second quarter as deposit betas remain below our modelled assumptions in both divisions. We expect margins to begin to decline from this point, but expect that the tailwind from interest rates for 2023 will be larger than the \u20ac900 million we had guided at the start of the year. Net interest margin at the group level increased to 1.5% as the accounting effects we noted in the first quarter partially reversed. As we noted at the time, these effects are held in C&O and are offset in non-interest revenues in the businesses and do not affect the group\u2019s total revenues. Average interest earning assets declined compared to the first quarter driven by lower average cash balances in the second quarter. With that: let\u2019s turn to adjusted costs, on Slide 10. Adjusted costs excluding bank levies were \u20ac4.9 billion and this is consistent with our guidance range of \u20ac1.6 billion to \u20ac1.65 billion per month. The increase of 4% was driven by inflationary pressures, ongoing investments and business growth which are partially offset by our continued cost reduction efforts. Compensation and benefits and information technology costs were broadly flat to the prior year quarter. Higher professional service costs were driven by business consulting and legal fees. The variance in other costs includes higher expenses for banking services and outsourced operations as well as movements in operational taxes. We also saw a normalization of marketing spend and talent recruitment to foster our growth trajectory. Let\u2019s now turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 11. Provision for credit losses in the second quarter was \u20ac401 million, equivalent to 33 basis points of average loans, slightly up compared to the previous quarter reflecting the broader impact of the macro environment. Stages 1 and 2 provisions were \u20ac63 million with the moderate sequential increase driven by portfolio and rating movements, especially in the Investment Bank. Stage 3 provisions of \u20ac338 million were broadly spread across our businesses and slightly lower compared to the previous quarter, partly reflecting a non-recurrence of provisions relating to a small number of idiosyncratic events in the International Private Bank. Overall, there are currently no signs of a persistent deterioration in the environment; however, we observed softening in some German midcap sectors, including Automotive, and continued weakness in Commercial Real Estate. For the full year, we continue to expect provisions to land within our guidance range of 25 basis points to 30 basis points of average loans, albeit at the upper end of the range. Looking at the first six months, provisions were in line with our expectations if we exclude the non-recurring events in the International Private Bank we had in the first quarter and for the second half of the year, we expect the usual quarterly run-rate of about \u20ac150 million in the Private Bank, while provisions in the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank are expected to overall remain in line with the first half of the year, taken together. Before we move to performance in our businesses, let me turn to capital on Slide 17. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 13.8% at the end of the second quarter, 15 basis points above the prior period. Organic capital generation contributed 16 basis points to the increase, reflecting our strong net income which was offset mainly by higher regulatory deductions for common equity dividends and AT1 coupons. Risk weighted assets remained broadly flat this quarter. In the second half of the year, we expect approximately 70 basis points of headwinds from various items we have discussed with you before, notably impacts from model and methodology changes, share buybacks and the Numis acquisition and our leverage ratio was 4.7% at the end of the second quarter, four basis points up versus the prior quarter based on our strong organic capital generation. Let\u2019s now turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 14. Corporate Bank revenues in the second quarter were over \u20ac1.9 billion, 25% higher year-on-year driven by an improved interest rate environment and continued pricing discipline, with growth across all client segments. Revenues remained close to the prior quarter due to continued lagging rate pass-through, fee growth in Institutional Client Services and stabilized deposit volumes. As we highlighted at our first quarter results, we do expect a normalization of our interest revenues in the second half of the year as client pass-through further accelerates. Deposits were \u20ac271 billion, essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter and to the first quarter 2023 as deposit levels stabilized despite increased interest rate competition and strong pricing discipline. Loan volume in the Corporate Bank was \u20ac116 billion, down by \u20ac13 billion compared to the prior year quarter and \u20ac5 billion compared to the previous quarter. This reduction reflected overall lower demand and continued selective balance sheet deployment in our Trade Finance & Lending business as well as the negative impact from FX movements. We remain conservative in our underwriting at this point in the cycle and continue to apply strict lending standards in order to maintain the high quality of our loan portfolio. Provision for credit losses increased in the quarter reflecting a weakening in certain sub-sectors- Noninterest expenses were \u20ac1.2 billion, an increase of 10% year on year driven by increased non-operating costs, predominantly litigation provisions, whereas adjusted costs remained stable. Profit before tax was \u20ac670 million in the quarter, up by 52% year-on-year. The cost/income ratio improved to 59% and post-tax return on tangible equity was 14.8%, despite higher non-recurring costs. I\u2019ll now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 15. Revenues for the second quarter were 11% lower year-on-year. FIC Sales & Trading decreased by 10% against what was an exceptional prior year quarter, and we are pleased with the underlying performance, which remained strong, with growth in structured activity helping to reduce the impact from a lower volatility environment. Financing revenues were higher year on year, reflecting the proven stability of the franchise, with net interest margin remaining robust and solid pipeline execution. Credit trading revenues were significantly higher driven by improvements in the flow business and strong performance in Distressed. Rates and Foreign Exchange revenues were significantly lower compared to a very strong prior year quarter and reflected a more normalized market environment than the prior year period. Emerging markets revenues were lower, as expected, with the prior year seeing heightened market activity linked to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and outperformance in the Asia region. Moving to Origination & Advisory, revenues were up 25%, driven by the non-recurrence of material leverage lending markdowns in the prior year. Excluding these markdowns, the business underperformed in a challenging market, with the global fee pool down approximately 20% year-on-year. Debt Origination revenues were significantly higher benefitting from the non-repeat of the aforementioned markdowns, though performance also reflected a partial year-on-year recovery in LDCM market share. Investment Grade revenues were slightly down year-on-year, but reflected market share gains in a lower fee pool environment. Advisory revenues were significantly lower reflecting both lower fee pool and relative underperformance. With indications that deal activity is starting to recover, we expect our investments in the Investment Bank to result in a significant rebound in the O&A performance into 2024. Noninterest expenses and adjusted costs increased versus the prior year, reflecting investments in both in our controls and the business to support future revenue growth. Loan balances were slightly higher year-on-year driven by higher origination across FIC, with quarter-on-quarter balances essentially flat. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac141 million, or 54 basis points of average loans. The increase versus the prior year was driven by higher Stage 1 and 2 provisions due to rating migrations and portfolio movements, combined with higher Stage 3 impairments, primarily in the Commercial Real Estate sector. Turning to the Private Bank on Slide 16; reported revenues were \u20ac2.4 billion in the quarter, up 11% year-on-year driven by higher deposit revenues. Revenues in the Private Bank Germany significantly increased by 16%, mainly due to higher deposit revenues, which more than compensated for changes in contractual and regulatory conditions effecting fee income. In addition, the prior year quarter benefited from higher valuation impacts. In the International Private Bank, revenues were up 4% or 6% if adjusted for forgone revenues from the sale of the Financial Advisory business in Italy. Growth was driven by deposit products, which also were the primary driver of the 11% growth in Premium Banking. In Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs, revenues were up 1% or 4% if adjusted for the aforementioned foregone revenues. Improved performance mainly in Europe was partially offset by continued slower business momentum in APAC. Turning to costs; noninterest expenses were up 26% mainly attributable to an increase in nonoperating expenses reflecting restructuring and severances provisions related to strategy execution as well as provisions for individual litigation cases, whereas the prior year quarter benefitted from net provision releases. Adjusted costs increased by 5%, mainly reflecting investments in infrastructure control improvements and strategic initiatives. Inflation impacts were largely mitigated by efficiency initiatives. Profits and key ratios in the quarter were impacted by total of \u20ac254 million of nonoperating expenses. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac147 million, or 22 basis points of average loans in the quarter, which reflects the continued stability of our high-quality loan book, especially in the retail businesses, and continued risk discipline. Provision for credit losses in the prior year quarter benefitted from releases of credit loss allowances following sales of non-performing loans. The significant sequential decline reflects a non-recurrence of certain idiosyncratic events in the International Private Bank in the first quarter. We saw solid net inflows in assets under management of \u20ac7 billion in the quarter with \u20ac4 billion in investment products and \u20ac3 billion in AuM deposits. Let me continue with Asset Management on Slide 17. As you will have seen in their report, DWS reported stable revenues despite the effect of weaker markets in 2022 and slightly lower adjusted profit before tax compared to the prior year. My usual reminder: the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Assets under management increased to \u20ac859 billion in the quarter, reflecting \u20ac11 billion of market appreciation and \u20ac9 billion of net inflows. Net inflows were primarily in Passive and Alternatives, notably in Real Estate. Flows in cash products once again have been significant and very volatile throughout the quarter ending with net outflows of \u20ac1 billion. Revenues declined by 6% versus the prior year. This was predominantly driven by higher funding charges in the segment and a decline in management fees from a reduction in average assets under management. Performance and transaction fees were significantly higher year-on-year driven by the Alternatives business. Other revenues declined due to higher funding charges and lower mark-to-market valuations of co-investments, partly offset by net interest income on excess cash from rising interest rates. Noninterest expenses were slightly higher, with adjusted costs remaining essentially flat. Compensation costs were slightly higher driven by variable retention costs and hiring to support transformation and business growth. General and administrative costs were also slightly higher, reflecting higher banking services costs and transformation implementation, mostly offset by a decline in group support costs. Nonoperating costs are significantly higher than the prior year, from an increase in litigation costs. Profit before tax of \u20ac103 million in the quarter was down 34% compared to the prior year. The cost-income ratio for the quarter was 76% and return on tangible equity was 12%. Moving to Corporate & Other on Slide 18; Corporate & Other reported a pre-tax loss of \u20ac115 million this quarter, a substantial improvement versus the pre-tax loss of \u20ac500 million in the second quarter of 2022 on the same basis. This year-on-year improvement was driven to a large part by valuation and timing differences, which were positive \u20ac252 million this quarter. As a reminder, valuation and timing differences arise on derivatives used to hedge the economic risk of the Group\u2019s balance sheet. These are accounting impacts, and the current period gains partially reflect reversals of prior period valuation losses, as the underlying instruments approach maturity. The pre-tax loss associated with our legacy portfolios was \u20ac170 million, versus negative \u20ac120 million in the prior year quarter, driven by additional litigation provisions relating to Polish foreign currency mortgages. Expenses associated with shareholder activities, as defined in the OECD Transfer Pricing guidelines, were \u20ac138 million in this quarter, compared to \u20ac120 million in the prior year quarter. Funding and liquidity impacts were negative \u20ac10 million in the current quarter, compared to negative \u20ac126 million in the prior year quarter. The reversal of non-controlling interests in the operating businesses, primarily from DWS, was positive \u20ac51 million, broadly flat year-on-year. Other impacts reported in the segment aggregated to negative \u20ac100 million. Risk-weighted assets stood at \u20ac41 billion at the end of the second quarter, down \u20ac2 billion since the first quarter of 2023. The RWA figure includes \u20ac19 billion of operational risk RWA. Turning to the Group outlook for the full year on Slide 19; with first half revenues above \u20ac15 billion, we believe that revenues above the mid-point of our guidance range of \u20ac28 billion to \u20ac29 billion for the full year 2023 are achievable. We continue to execute on our agenda to foster the bank\u2019s growth ambitions and to improve the bank\u2019s structural efficiency. As Christian outlined, we have a number of measures underway. Adjusted costs for the full year 2023 are still expected to be essentially flat compared to 2022, benefiting from strict cost management, lower Single Resolution Fund charges for the current year as well as a potential restitution payment from a national resolution fund. We now expect noninterest expenses to be slightly higher compared to 2022; this reflects higher-than-anticipated litigation expenses we had in the second quarter and an impact in relation to the Numis transaction, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter. Provision for credit losses is now expected at the upper end of our guidance range of 25 basis points to 30 basis points of average loans, reflecting the current macro backdrop and lower loan balances than initially anticipated. Our capital guidance is unchanged; our second quarter CET1 ratio of 13.8% allows us to absorb roughly 70 basis points of headwinds in the second half reflecting the impacts from model changes, share buybacks and the Numis acquisition. We remain committed to our capital objectives, most importantly the distribution of \u20ac8 billion to shareholders in respect of the financial years 2021 to 2025 and moving up to a 50% payout ratio and as Christian said, part of this plan is the next phase of our share buyback, which will commence next month and will be finalized in the second half of this year. So, the performance and the growth opportunities we seized in the first half of this year strengthen our confidence in the path towards our 2025 targets and our Global Hausbank strategy. With that, let me hand back to Silke and we look forward to your questions."

Maybe firstly, big picture, the macro has been pretty weak; growth is slowing, confidence is low, house prices are declining and in light of this environment, where do you actually see opportunities for your revenue growth, especially in the more stable businesses? Where do you see the risks? And then secondly, you're more concrete in terms of the numbers. The revenue guidance went up for the year, but still implies more like \u20ac6.8 billion to \u20ac7 billion per quarter in the second half. And there's obviously seasonality but you overearned in the first half. So how should we think about the jump-off from the second half into 2024? Can you actually grow revenue is in '24 versus '23? Thank you very much."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Good morning, Anke and thank you very much for your question. Let me start and James will potentially add. First of all, on your description on the macro side, I agree, but I think it completely validates that what we have shared with you in the previous calls. We always said that 2023 will be based on a very weak economy, on a kind of a no-growth scenario. I even expect for the end of '23 technical or a very mild recession in Germany potentially also in the US. And that was always an exactly the foundation of our plan. And hence, Anke, there is no negative surprise in the macro economic outlook when it comes to our plan or to the underlying drivers, be it revenues, be it also risk-crossed. And that is also, I think, important, that from a risk point of view, our credit forecast was always built, exactly on that description of the market you just shared with us, and hence, we also don't see any downside to our credit forecast, which James just again reemphasised in his prepared remarks. When it comes to where do we see growth opportunities in particular for the stable business in such an environment, look, I really do believe that the global house bank strategy in particular in the stable business is exactly the right answer. And that's what we feel kind of on a day-to-day basis with our clients. Of course, we are benefiting from the NII and get back to that in a second, but if you think about what kind of discussions and mandates we win with our corporate banking clients around the world when it comes to reorganising their networks, reorganising their supply chains, making sure that we, obviously, then follow up with the cash management systems around the world, as an answer to their reorganised network, then this brings us a lot of new mandates, which, honestly, is even above our expectations. Of course, in this regard, also the most recent upgrades from rating agencies again help us, because whenever we get this obviously, it helps to increase revenues and new clients onboarding. In the private bank, there is a lot of ask, and you see that also in our development in the assets under management on the investment side. I think there we are seeing not only in Germany, but if I look in particular in other European countries in Spain and Italy, we are seeing, as the go-to bank when it comes to investment advice. And this is, if you talk to the clients in this scenario where inflation is still above 5%, where they think about how they secure their pensions. Now with having post bank fully integrated on our Deutsche Bank system, these people think about how to secure the pensions, and that is obviously our chance and opportunity, and that is what we see in the daily business on the investment business. And in the IB, I know that a lot of people are always thinking this is the more volatile business, but I think we shouldn't underestimate also in these days the stability of the financing business in the IB, again, shown in Q2, also year-over-year. I think the future investments we are doing in the O&A business, they will pay off, because we can see that, actually the trough in this business has been passed, and we see from the mandates we are discussing with the clients, that there is clearly an uplift in this business, and therefore I expect rising revenues actually in that business also in Q3, and in the following quarters. And I also think that Q2 has again shown that also in the trading business, we have done quite well and also compared to our peers and that we are actually maintaining or even growing our market share So if I take all this, I think the positioning of the global house bank with 70% of the revenues now coming from the private bank, corporate bank and the asset management, growing assets under management, I really do think we have the right answer in particular for the environment we are experiencing right now. Now coming to the concrete revenue question and not only for '23 or '24, let me give you some more guidance. A, the NII curve is holding up far stronger than we initially planned and I do believe that with regard to our own existing plan, we see positive surprises also in the second half of '23 And I do also think in '24. Let me give you one example in the private bank business, we see a modest three-digit million revenue increase potential in the second half alone versus our own plan and that is mainly coming from NII, but also from the growing assets under management. The assumptions which we had so far in the corporate bank when it comes to the decrease in NII, I would say we are too conservative and I would also predict that going forward, this would be slower than anticipated, it will come down, but it is slower. The growth in investment and other fee income, as I just said, is encouraging. It's not only the assets under management, but you have seen the announcement of relationship business we are doing. For instance with Lufthansa on Miles & More and to be honest, this is not the one-off, this is actually coming more and more as additional mandates. In particular, if I think about how the corporate bank is thriving, these mandates are coming more and more and therefore I really do believe we are building now the platform to grow in non-NII business with all the technology spend, which we did in the corporate bank, but also obviously in the other business. And therefore we did all the investments in O&A and wealth management, also in hiring the people because we see that business will grow, that there is the increased discussions we have with clients in particular in O&A and therefore we stepped up for that. So looking at all of this and with the starting base of \u20ac15 billion of revenues, look, there is clearly upside in the private bank versus our own plan in the second half and to be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if we see the similar number in the private bank in the second half then what we have seen in the first half. I think very stable numbers in the corporate bank, potentially slightly lower because of the NII curve, but again, we have been very conservative in the past, potentially too conservative. Stable asset management and very robust IB was growing O&A revenues. So all this gave us the confidence changed in that we clearly can hint to a higher revenue base than the midpoint of \u20ac28 billion to \u20ac'29 billion. I think we can focus on the \u20ac29 billion number. And if I then look at the businesses we are creating, again in the non-NII, but also actually what we always emphasize here that the real uptick in NII in the private bank is only coming in '24 and '25, honestly, I'm very bullish on the revenue trajectory for '24 and '25. So I think we are exactly rightly placed from a revenue point of view from a positioning and hinted it placed into our half."

Thank you."

      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Thanks Nicolas. It's James. I'll take both of your questions and Christian may want to add. Look we've talked about the run rate as we -- it gives you a sense of what management is focused on and I think, the past three quarters, we've been able to adhere to the run rate and it's been an area of real focus given both the need to deliver on cost savings measures in order to support that and manage the investments in a phasing that corresponds with the cost takeout that we're -- that we're achieving. So if I think about priorities, look, our priorities on the cost measures are reasonably clear. We laid them out in March of last year and we're building on that and they are focused on particularly technology distribution platform and in private bank in particular, but not exclusively and then infrastructure support, can we make that infrastructure support more efficient and so we're very focused on that and the delivery. In terms of priorities on the business growth side, leave aside control investments for a moment where I do think we're near or at the peak of what is required in order to finish that control remediation agenda. We've been -- we want to be really clear that our focus is on the capital light product areas in the firm and the ability to grow fee and commission income going forward that supports both the return potential of the company and the distribution profile in the future. And those areas, Christians talked about wealth management being one, origination advisory being the second. In the corporate bank, the fee income sources in the corporate bank that go to technology capabilities, but also just growing our client footprint in some areas where we're a leader, I have doc custody for as one example. So we've been focused on those types of investments and I think we're making really good progress. Just going to the run rate, one thing, as much as we're focused on that range, we do see the pressures I've outlined coming towards the end of the year, Numis, as an obvious example, will give us about \u20ac50 million per quarter of additional expense and then the investment we make in front line bankers taking advantage of the opportunity in the marketplace, maybe a little bit more. So, if they're the exit rates per month is perhaps \u20ac25 million more constant FX, that would be a natural place, but I think we're, in essence, we've started to run downhill in terms of the -- our ability to deliver on those cost savings being derisked, if you like, and gaining momentum. The Unity project is one example that is behind us. And as we said in the prepared remarks, now it's about crystallizing the run rate benefits over time, but there are many more similar initiatives that will have a cumulative impact at which point our greater challenge is phasing of growth investments rather than delivery of cost savings. I just want to say one other thing, while we're on the costs, this nonoperating cost area for us, obviously, frustrating to have those exceed, especially those out of our control original planning. So I look to the second half, we would expect at around, say, \u20ac100 million per quarter, the remainder of the restructuring and severance costs that we outlined for the year to come through. Always uncertain on litigation, but clearly, we would hope to do much better going forward than in the most recent quarter. And then finally, one thing to just make you aware of, we alluded to a little bit in our disclosures it's early to talk about specific purchase price adjustments and what have you in the numerous closing process. But our current expectation is that we would impair the goodwill attached to that immediately on closing. So in the fourth quarter, producing about a \u20ac200 million item there also that we would think of as nonoperating. So for your models and awareness. On CLPs, I'll try to be shorter. Look, the guidance takes into account everything we know today. The environment on balance is in line with our expectations. And if I go all the way back to the beginning of the year, maybe even a little better than our expectations. We did have the idiosyncratic items in the first quarter in IPB come through, and that sort of pushed us up in our range. But otherwise, at the, call it, 30 basis points, we think it captures our expectations about the second half. And we see this as a slightly elevated but not a broad deterioration of the credit environment. So we're very comfortable with the guidance there."

        "text": "I've got one on capital and one on NII. On capital and capital return, good to see the \u20ac450 million, but I wanted to poke around a little bit beyond that. The pro forma CET1 is 13.1% post your headwinds, your capital generative. So would it be possible for a buyback to another leg to come as soon as the full year results. And then you're clearly highlighting \u20ac8 billion of total capital return through the '22 to '25 plan, of which have really done \u20ac1.75 billion. So just a sense of how quickly you need to accelerate capital return plans in order to get through that full GBP 8 billion, I think it would be really helps to investors. The \u20ac450 million is helpful, but people want to know what's coming beyond that? And then secondly, on NII, you're talking about the long-dated NII tailwind within the private bank. This makes sense given the nature of that business. But can you put some numbers to it? I think there's worries in the market around peak NII, but a sense of what that recurring tailwind in into '24, '25, '26 and even beyond, would look like -- would give us a bit more confidence about your revenue trajectory beyond this year? So a bit more color around volume of hedges or kind of the back book rate on those hedges would really give us a bit more -- some more to play with when we think about the longer-term NII story."

        "text": "Thank you, Adam, for your questions. Let me start with your capital question, and then I hand over to James, with regard to the NII question and some more details beyond the comments I made before. Look, on the capital, first of all, thank you very much for the recognition of the \u20ac450 million. It's, I think, hugely important for management to deliver that what we have promised. And so far, what we have promised we delivered. And therefore, 1 thing is clear, the \u20ac8 billion absolutely stand that is our target. And based how the company evolves, how actually the capital ratio looks like, if I think about the growth. You just heard from James, how committed we are on the cost line and hence to further increase the operating leverage, we have full confidence in delivering the \u20ac8 billion. I think, and we clearly understand that obviously, this should be a continuous trajectory. And therefore, I also said in the prepared remarks, it is clearly our aim to continue that distribution in '24. Now you will understand after we just published our share buyback last night that we won't give you the details for next year because this also always requires a detailed planning. Our planning around starts in September. Then I think we have such a constructive relationship with our regulator that warrants then the next discussion. But looking where we see the firm, it is our clear aim to continue this trajectory in I think we have gone on a pretty nice journey with an annual increase of 50% when it comes to dividend. We did this not only on the dividend side but also on the share buyback. And as we think this is exactly the right approach, one can potentially think that this is the management aim also to do that in '24. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of way forward. But clearly, it's not back-end loaded only in '25. We know what we have to deliver in '24. James?"

The hedging on the PB portfolio is longer than than CB and more euro heavy. So that effect will be with us for several years after '24. It's been a while since I've looked at this in this way. But my memory is that, that uplift is sort of between $200 million and $300 million per year for a period of time. So that uplift is considerable just on the rate side. If you've got volumes and sort of a spread dynamic, sort of more active hedging as well as capital benefits and improving unsecured spreads, there's a number of different features that can help support the NII of the group and the businesses over time. So isolating that item, good story. There's a sustainable growth that comes after 24 and actually already in '24, especially in the second half, but it's one of a number of supportive items. Hopefully, that helps give you some color on it."

That gets me to \u20ac20.1 billion annualized. Is there any other factors that you think we should consider rather than this constant adjustment of the cost base? Can you share that with us as anything else, any curveball that we should think which could impact costs in '24/'25 going forward? And in that context, on a stated cost basis, can you just clarify what we should think of as a run rate severance and litigation expenses? You mentioned numbers in the past, but they might have changed based on the experience in the second quarter. And then the second question I have is regarding the private bank. You're running at a clean cost income around \u20ac76 million, still looks very high, considering how the higher rates have helped you on the NII. And I was thinking how we should think about the cost income development, and in particular cost development absolute in the private bank."

        "text": "So thank you, Kian. Yes. 1.675 is not a bad place to think of in terms of exit rate. We'd be pleased to run the company out there over the course of next year. There are always curveballs in the expense world, but we -- and that's what I mean by running downhill, I think that are the tools that we have to manage those curve balls hopefully begin to expand. As we come out of a shrinking control remediation, repairing our technology estate world of call it the past five years and move into a growth and an accelerating benefit from initiatives under way world. Leave FX aside for a second because that'll obviously change the run rate going forward, but otherwise, I'd say inflation is tough, especially on the technology side. So how much inflation flows through. Again, I want to be clear because we have so much coming on the expense initiative side, it would then give us the flexibility to phase and time some of the investments in a way that gives us control and allows us to manage that. Obviously, we'd like to make the investments and investments that are high return low marginal cost income ratio is the direction of travel, but that gives us sort of additional levers. Litigation, sevens and instruction, obviously, the second is in our control. We would probably tell you that a typical severance year, if nothing else is going on, is maybe 100, 150 per year. So not gigantic and it really just depends on whether there are larger programs that we initiate and then put aside, but obviously, we'd like to get to the end of a period of time where major initiatives are necessary as part of the transformation of the company. And then on litigation, that's been hard to estimate and in fairness, there've been items that have taken us by surprise, both last year with the third party messaging, as an example, in this most recent quarter with a number of items. One always has the view that as you get through items, they're behind you, you've taken out the risk, and then, therefore, the forward list of matters begins to diminish, but it's -- and the run rate there, therefore, is hard to define properly, but we'd love for that to be sub-400 in a year, let alone in a quarter. On private bank, Christian will want to, want to add, but the operating leverage in private bank will be, we think, dramatic over the years ahead, and that's really the story there."

        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Yeah. So, well, you took my words, because, here, and I think you are right, obviously, we are not yet happy with the cost income ratio we have in the private bank, but if you see only on the cost side, what is still to come, just because of the finalization now of Unity, \u20ac300 million of costs will fall away in '25. We have branch closures further to come, I think, in the last quarter, or in the last two quarters, we close approximately 90 branches or 100 branches. That goes on, this is continuing. You have seen our announcement on the mortgage side that we are actually reducing, reducing there also, our people in that business as a consequence of our business mix and the capital allocation. So, I think on the cost side in the private bank, if I also look at all the key deliverables under Rebecca's wing, where she is now working with Claudio de Sanctis on, there is a clear cost take out on itself, and I haven't even touched now on the revenue side. On the revenue side, actually clear upside, I just gave you a little bit of number for the second half of 2023. This is not extraordinary income. This is just better revenues that we initially planned, that will continue also when I look at the plan in the year '24 and '25, also on the back of the NII comments, James made earlier, and all that brings us actually into a cost income range for the private bank, which is in the low 60s, and that in 2025, that is our plan, and we feel exactly on that trajectory. And I do also think with the announcements, Claudio made on making the structure now, after building up the private bank internationally and private in Germany under cards leadership now moving it together there is additional costs which we actually take out. So therefore, I'm absolutely confident that we can achieve this low 60s cost/income ratio than in '25."

So my question is, why the change in definition and what is the like for likes to go to the \u20ac33 billion at Q1? And then secondly, you talk about an additional \u20ac800 million a stress pad that provisions for CRE, but presumably some of that's already captured in your basic provisioning guidance, given the current provisioning run rate of \u20ac100 million a quarter for CRE.

So over this year and next, we would expect another, a few hundred million of total provisions to come in and therefore, I would say about \u20ac500 million incremental. We had been working hard on that disclosure, and also to your question about definitions, what we were trying to clean up this is two things. One is the NACE code disclosure, which is a is an industry definition, but to be fair, not really how we think about risk managing the portfolio. And therefore, we wanted to bridge from the NACE at around $40 billion within the NACE definition, there is nonrecourse and recourse.. Ironically there's also some non-recourse outside of the nase definition in these numbers. So we're trying to give you, sort of reconcile if you like to some of the existing external disclosures. What I think is important though, is this, kind of the \u20ac33 billion of the old focus portfolio, the \u20ac34 billion of the new focus portfolio, what we're trying to give you is a sense of the size of the perimeter that is our focus from a risk management perspective, where we think, what is the portfolio that can produce losses based on its exposure to the current environment, that's a little bit different today than it was in the COVID time when we first created the focus portfolio, and so hence also a shift to that, but not a meaningful, difference in, in terms of total exposures.

And I just wondered what the main changes, whether it's sort of visibility on your headwinds or other factors, so sort of what has changed in that regulatory context and these approvals being so forthcoming now? And then my second question, also on capital, I just wanted if you had any perspectives on the US Basel III finalization that's coming through and just how that might impact you, either in your -- does it impact your local US business or do you already have such a high CET1 ratio there that it's not particularly affected, does it affect competitive position for the group in the U.S. or elsewhere?

So I must be careful and don't want to say friendly because that may be even taken wrong then. So we have a very constructive relationship with our regulator and that should be always the case. Look what changed and James may want to add for this, I think actually nothing really changed because we ourselves at the beginning of the year as we always said in November and December says we want to wait how 23 is starting, how the economy is actually developing. We would like to see how the first quarter is developing. And we -- as we now can say, we didn't actually apply for a share buyback at that point in time because we wanted to see what is going on in this world. Volatility was around. We have the geopolitical uncertainties. We had an inflation. The economic forecast were everything between a hard recession and actually a growth scenario. And therefore, I think, rightly so, also with all that, what we could see, James decided and with my full support that we, for the time being hold off. And then we started well into the year. We had a far better forecast what is happening. We saw how stable the business is developing. And we saw we are making good progress. And that was the right time then also with the forecast into '23 and '24 to apply for that. And in this regard, I think we had very constructive discussions. And this is my own assumption and only interpretation. I do think that the regulator also actually recognized that we were on the cautious side at the end of 2022 when it came to the start of '23. And I think that also then obviously was at least not taken negatively."

And of course, that was -- the progress during the year was visible to them through the year. On U.S. Basel III final framework, obviously, very curious to see what's in it. I don't think it really impacts us in a meaningful way. in terms of our business operations, potentially competitive positioning, given that, in our view, European banks have been at a capital disadvantage for some time. And then there's also at least the possibility that the timing of implementation could give us a bit more breathing room relative to the first of January 25. But beyond that, not much expected. I would not expect that the European legislator sort of reopens its discussions based on whatever they read in the NPR. And I think that's appropriate. Where Europe should decide for itself what the appropriate legislation and implementation looks like."

First of all, I think Karl has done a wonderful job in actually making sure that the private banking business is becoming a profitable business. He has done a lot in order to make sure that we are on the trajectory to become a very profitable business, as we said also to Kian's question. So the trajectory, which Karl has laid is exactly the right one. Now what we will see actually in the private banking business is actually that the international private banking business and the German private banking business is moving closer together from a product responsibility from an investment responsibility also from an infrastructure and servicing responsibility. So you will see a more leaner structure, which we now can do after we have done the necessary steps in Germany with Unity. We can now actually put it under a more combined and efficient leadership together, which obviously will bring certain cost benefits. On top of that, I do believe that Claudio will focus very much across the private banking business on the investment arm on the capital LiDAR. You have seen that he has done that very successfully in the international private bank. And I do believe if I look at the long-term challenges in particular in Germany, if you really think about what the people are concerned about -- it's about the pensions. It's about the state pensions, which will come or not come in 10 or 15 years. And in this regard, there is in almost each and every client meeting, there is a question how can I actually plan for my own retirement in that time period. And for that, you need a first-class offering on the investment side. And that's exactly where you need the private banking experience, private banking expertise we have with Claudio, which we have with a lot of other people. And that's, I think, where Claudio is very much focusing on. Secondly, he would make sure that also this offering in a digital way will make its way to 15 million clients now all on the same IT platform that is really a meaningful step forward. So I'm very proud of what happened with Unity. So I do think the power, which we can now bring particular in the investment business to Deutsche Bank clients, but in particular, to 15 million post bank clients being now part of our technology, is simply outstanding, and Claudio will focus on that. On the miles and more, look, I haven't seen, by the way, from the competition and also from the deal in itself that the competition was not interested anymore in such a deal. That was a real race. We are super proud that we were able to be selected by Miles & More and by Lufthansa made the difference. At the end of the day, our clients can far better talk about that. I will not talk about that, the client took a decision. But I do believe that our shift four years ago that the corporate bank, the day-to-day business, the combination, the client centricity, which we have built between the private bank, the corporate bank, the way these two units work together and worked in that pitch made it different. We delivered on Deutsche Bank to Lufthansa. And one Deutsche Bank to Lufthansa is not only the best platform for miles more and the best technology, which, by the way, we started to invest already last year in order to be ready now to really do the migration. What we deliver to them is 15 million additional potential clients and that nobody else has and with the commitment of the full Board that the private bank and the corporate bank is as much as the heart of the Deutsche Bank business as our focused investment bank, I think the clients get it, and they want them to work with us. And I think that is the advantage which we can deliver. And I can tell you that is only the start because with that mandate, we will, I think, have a big, big chance to win other card businesses in Germany and in Europe."

I think the met latest guidance was for risk-weight inflation of about \u20ac30 billion. But if I'm not mistaken, that excludes the impact of the output floor. So maybe you could also give us additionally what that impact might be from the output floor. And then on Slide 9 of the presentation on net interest margin. I see that your average interest earning assets have been declining for a few quarters here. You've pointed to lower cash balances as a cause for Q2. But is there something a bit more persistent going on in terms of maybe high interest rates denting demand for loans or maybe also the contribution from the reduction in sub hurdle lending, maybe that has a larger impact here. So if you could talk about that in a bit more detail. And then the third question is a bit more technical. So you've got EPS of only \u20ac0.19 here. So I'm trying to reconcile the net profit that you've used to calculate this, it's only \u20ac402 million, which is a lot lower than the \u20ac763 million. So I'm trying to understand how you get to the 402 million. Both of these measures include the deduction of 81 coupons.

On the capital impact, I'd say we would probably stick with the -- with our earlier commentary, which I think was 10%, but it's been a while since we've looked at that incremental of the output floor then between 25% and 30%. And in fairness, that's all premitigation, business model changes and all that good stuff. So it's there's no update on that, but that would be orders of magnitude. And I think important to emphasize the capital measures that we talked about in April, I mean you can ask where they intended to support offsetting Basel III impact or to support the distribution same, same. They're really, I think, valuable in both respects to and to shift the group to more capital-light usage of the balance sheet. It goes a little bit to your NIM or interest-earning assets question. I'd be surprised if the next number in the series were as big as of a downward movement as the last albeit loan growth has clearly slowed down, and you're seeing the impact now of some of the decisions we announced in April around trade finance and lending as well as the mortgage book. So we would expect to see some impact in the loan balances as a consequence but we think that, that's the right decision economically in terms of supporting both ROTE and NIM going forward. And maybe I just -- I want to make sure I understand the reconciliation that you're referring to in terms of the -- was it a forward on capital that you were after? Or -- I wasn't sure."

So I'm trying to understand how you get to that \u20ac402 million because on Slide 15, you've got net profit of \u20ac763 million. So there's a big down shift here in the net profit.

        "text": "I had two questions. The first one was on capital returns. So clearly, with the new buyback announced, your distributions are now \u20ac1.75 billion and the remaining is \u20ac6.25 billion to that \u20ac8 billion total target. So if I take your 50% payout policy, you would need to generate about $13 billion plus in net income over the next two years. And then this is much higher versus consensus at about \u20ac9 billion right now combined for '24 and '25. So I'm wondering how -- what are the key drivers you're looking at to bridge that gap. So that's one. And then the second 1 is on your investment banking business. So you have clearly hired a lot on the front office side there. in both banking and capital markets, plus there's a demo deal that is underway too. So clearly, you're positioning for a potential rebound in banking and capital markets activity. So what I wanted to check there is if you have a target market share in mind in terms of what you -- where you want to see your banking business versus the global peers? Or with the recent hiring of the Numis deal, do you think you are rightsized from a staffing perspective at least for now? That's about it."

        "text": "So Vishal, yes, on the first item, you're probably just missing a year. So we -- it's a little bit complex the way we do it, but we've said in respect of the years '21 to '25, paid in the years '22 and this would include a little bit of capital then returned in -- or a lot of capital returned in '26. So we think our -- on the trajectory that we're on, which you remember is sort of asymptotic if you go 50% per year, the increase is quite steep, and we think also prudent in light of our own view of the earnings growth potential of DB. On the IB item, and I'll focus now on origination and advisory, where the investments have been going they'd be more visible perhaps there have been investments into the FIC platform, which we think have performed very nicely in terms of our market share improvements from a low point in '18 and '19 to where we are today. We're very pleased with that progression. But in the corporate finance area where we've invested more recently, our market share has been bouncing around 2%. And we do think there's a significant opportunity for us there. We don't have a specific target, but I don't think there's any reason why we shouldn't be able to double the market share in -- again, with our in a disciplined way inside our client footprint inside our capital footprint. But by doing just much better in terms of closing industry gaps in terms of building more of the chain, for example, with private equity sponsors, both on the way in and the way out. There's a lot of potential that is, if you like, within our franchise perimeter that we really just haven't captured. So lots of upside for us there, I believe."

I'm just wondering if you could elaborate on that because -- the second quarter was actually pretty strong. And last year prior periods were also very strong on a relative basis. So yes, I would just like to know what gives you that confidence. Is it just a simple kind of maybe the credit side of things or increasing a little bit more into the back end of the year?"

So I do think there's just in that, there's a real opportunity to take the year-on-year in revenue up significantly. I think we're in an interesting time. We've talked about the macro weakening in lower volatility, and you've started to see that against a high base and one where we think we're executing well in terms of our client engagement. But in the language I've been using the micro coming back, especially credit and financing businesses and doing quite well. An interesting question, is there an environment in which the credit stays that continues to do well in the second half and going into '24. But because we find ourselves now on the other side of the cycle, increasing volatility as investors now begin to position for an uncertain path in terms of reducing policy rates and an uncertain path in terms of the length of time the policy rates stay at the terminal rate. So there's sort of an interesting environment that we see coming in the second half of the year. We'll see whether that comes to fruition or not. But what we -- what we're -- on Mac and his team, super focused on is just engaging with our clients so that we can participate both in the flow side of that activity as well as the structure. And I think they've done a fabulous job at that. And the second quarter is a good is a good indication of how we can perform in that market or maybe a slightly better backdrop."

I know that you communicated a 70 basis point impact from Numis deal closing the share buyback and some of the regulatory melanges. I think Christian mentioned securitization and reduction in software lending potentially resulting also in some RB reduction. Could you perhaps quantify that? The second question is on the corporate bank. Obviously, the loan book declined about 4% quarter-on-quarter. I know sold down is intentional and coming from risk management and perhaps some impact of some current lending. But I'm just wondering to what extent do you see future demand? Is that entirely driven by you? And if so, when do you expect the turnaround on that front?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "Sure. Thank you, M\u00e1t\u00e9. So briefly, the 70 basis points is still -- we're still thinking 50 basis points of model methodology adjustments there's a range around that. And then 9 basis points for Numis, 12 basis points for the capital return. The other moving parts are organic capital generation and how much we use in terms of balance sheet growth, that should produce a year-end ratio probably higher than our original guidance for the year. So we'd like to -- we'd probably be closer to or further into the 13s, let's say, than just the 200 basis points margin to MDA, which would be $13.2 million. Within that, we do have embedded some assumptions about what additional support we can get from securitizations, optimization and other of the capital measures. Look, we -- I think if we outperform those assumptions or our own execution sort of path, that puts us in an even better position going into both for distribution and for the Basel III build. So those are some of the moving parts that we see."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Yes. And on your second question, I think your kind of differentiation is the right one. Some of the lower loan growth or even decline is intentionally, by the way, not only from a risk management point of view because we have actually a very conservative and long-standing risk appetite, and therefore, we don't need to do so many adjustments in between. But of course, also we have sub hurdle relationships where we -- and we said that in April, where we want to go for an even better and more focused risk return strategy, and that's what we are doing. So that is one part. And secondly, yes, I think in particular, in Europe but also in Germany, you see that mid-cap companies, family-owned companies that you see a softening in loan growth and the reduction in demand for the time being, in particular, when it comes to long-term investments. To be honest, I don't think that this is something which is continuing for a very long period. But I would say that those companies would like to see where the next 6 to 12 months are going. And therefore, I would say this rather soft loan growth is something which we will see in the second half of '23, which is part of our planning and also which goes into the first half year of 24%. Nevertheless, and therefore, again, it is so important that we build the corporate bank on various engines. And the other engines are the fee income, our cash management mandates. The card business I was just talking about before. And that actually gives us all the confidence that even with the softening demand, which in my view is only temporary and will come back we can actually compensate that with fee business, and that is the reason why we invested into that so much."

I was just kind of curious what gives you the confidence that it's not persistent deterioration and/or are you changing any behavior or your credit that you provide into that space? And then secondly, just -- I guess, just to help my understanding. But in terms of pass-through rates, so for the NIM. What are the factors that are kind of driving the lower pass-through rates. I appreciate maybe there's some conservative assumptions. But what are the things that you think will drive changes or kind of increase in pass-through as we kind of go through time. So just curious what are the factors that you think are influencing pass-through at the moment and into the second half of the year."

        "text": "Thank you for your questions. Let me start on the asset quality because I'm also in a lot of client contact actually also in Germany, obviously. A, I really do believe, and I said it again and again, but the resilience of the family-owned companies and the mid-cap companies in Germany is bigger than a lot of people think. If I think about how they actually improved from the 2008 global financial crisis, if you think about how they actually increased capital, how they improve their working capital systems, their liquidity. This is a completely different picture than it was 15 years ago. And I'm saying it because they go with a different buffer into the situation which we have right now. And that's also what we are seeing not only in our portfolio. But if you actually look at the overall statistics, there is no such thing like a material deterioration in the credit worthiness of the German mid-cap companies. Now what is then specifically on us, and I do believe even go further back to Deutsche Bank's history in 2002 and 2003 when we actually had too many credit losses in that area. We completely changed the way we are managing credit risk also for medium and family-owned corporates when it comes to concentration risk when it comes to differentiating between, sort of, say, winners and potential companies which are more challenged in certain industries, we have a clear industry view and not only the specific company view. And by that, I think our risk management to the individual review of corporate is simply a superior one. And I personally just went last week through the -- for instance, the OEM suppliers in Germany. If I look at the portfolio, how diversified we are from a rating point of view, from a concentration risk point of view, i.e., that there are no big concentration risk. If we have larger risk, it's actually with investment-grade companies, who are actually themselves diversified globally in their business, then I do believe that there may be a little bit of deterioration in that portfolio, but I can't see that we are coming into a situation where I would see a material deterioration of our mid-cap portfolio. So looking at their own resilience and the way we have risk managed that, I'm confident that, obviously, our portfolio is in good health. James?"

        "text": "So on pass-through, it's an interesting topic. And in some ways, it's going to be too early to tell. So we'll all sort of do the analysis of this cycle once it's over. I think a few things. One, I think the dollar -- it's different by currency. I think the dollar has started to converge perhaps not to model but to a place that looks to us to potentially be where things settle out, a little bit better than the models would have expected. The euro is still well behind. What's driving that? I think there's discipline -- pricing discipline in the industry. I think there's an element of this cycle is different because of how sharp and how steep and how fast it was. I think there's an element that the banking industry had a long time of negative and is seeking to recover some of that sort of lost structural profitability. And I think client behavior is also a piece of the puzzle here. Obviously, there -- especially the more you go to wholesale money, they're smart enough to move their money to places that it earns a higher yield and -- but then they also know they need to leave a certain amount of money with the banks, and they understand that the remuneration of that for payments and operational purposes. And I understand that remuneration for that money is -- doesn't follow the market because there are services attached to it. So I think that's an understanding of the business model that's maybe better than it has been in the past. So lots of different drivers we'll need to unpack in time, but one that I think is overall a bullish sign for the industry of the value that banks, frankly, are providing to their clients, not just in corporate and middle market but also in the retail space."

    "transcript": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. I am Sandra, the chorus call operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the Deutsche Bank Q3 2023 Analyst Conference Call. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Silke Szypa, Deputy Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, madam.\nSilke Szypa: Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2023 results call. As usual, our Chief Executive Officer, Christian Sewing, will speak first; followed by our Chief Financial Officer, James von Moltke. The presentation, as always, is available to download in the Investor Relations section of our website at db.com. Before we get started, let me just remind you that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which may not develop as we currently expect. We, therefore, ask you to take notice of the precautionary warning at the end of our materials. With that, let me hand over to Christian.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, Silke, and a warm welcome also from my side. It's a pleasure to be discussing our third quarter and nine-month results with you today. These results show our continued progress on the path to our targets in several respects. First and foremost, we continue to demonstrate strong earnings momentum. We generated profit before tax of \u20ac5 billion in the first nine months, after absorbing nearly \u20ac950 million in non-operating costs including restructuring related to operational efficiencies. Our post-tax RoTE was 7% and would have been nearly 9% excluding these non-operating costs and with bank levies apportioned equally across the year. This reflects progress on our path to meet our 2025 target of above 10%. Second, we are seeing progress across all three dimensions of accelerated execution of our Global Hausbank strategy, namely revenue growth, operational efficiency, and capital efficiency. Strong operating performance is driven by business momentum through a well-balanced business model. Revenues in the first nine months were \u20ac22.2 billion, up 6% year-on-year, well above our target growth rate. Private Bank and Asset Management together attracted net inflows of \u20ac39 billion alongside \u20ac18 billion of deposit growth at the Group level in the third quarter. We also continue to make progress on the second dimension of our Global Hausbank strategy, operational efficiency. We have progressed with existing measures and we have additional measures in flight. And in terms of capital, we are delivering on our distribution commitments. We are on track to complete the \u20ac450 million share repurchase announced in July, thereby delivering total distributions across 2022 and 2023 of \u20ac1.75 billion. We finished the third quarter with strong capital. Our CET1 ratio was 13.9%. In addition, we have identified further capital opportunities and we now see scope to free up additional capital of \u20ac3 billion, enabling us to accelerate our strategy and boost returns, above our original expectations, from now to 2025 and beyond. This gives us added potential to increase capital distributions to shareholders while also deploying capital to support clients. Before we move on to progress in our businesses, let me give you an update on the Postbank IT migration. This was one of the largest IT migration projects in European banking and is essential to lay the foundations for a more digital bank offering at Postbank. We successfully migrated 50 billion records of 12 million Postbank customers; however, we saw unexpected levels of client enquiries which led to backlogs. We have put measures in place to work through these backlogs. This not only includes an increase of temporary staff, but also accelerating measures already underway such as implementation of automation and process optimization tools. And I am pleased that we have reduced the operational backlog by about two-thirds over the past weeks, and we expect 70% of all impacted Postbank customer processes to run against service level commitments again by end of October, including processes which have been particularly critical for our clients. We are confident that the remainder will be completed in the fourth quarter. Let me now turn to the key highlights of our resilient performance over the nine months on Slide 2. We delivered operating leverage of 4% on an adjusted basis in the first nine months, with revenues up 6% and adjusted costs up 2%. As a result, our pre-provision profit for the first nine months was up 5% year-on-year to \u20ac6 billion. In addition, we continue to reap the benefits of disciplined risk management and a high-quality loan book; provision for credit losses for the first nine months remained in line with our full year guidance at 28 basis points of average loans. Our balance sheet proved its resilience. Deposits rebounded by \u20ac18 billion to \u20ac611 billion in the third quarter. We saw franchise momentum across the board. And furthermore, we strengthened our capital position. Our CET1 ratio rose to 13.9% during the quarter, thanks, primarily, to strong organic capital generation from earnings and the results of our capital optimization efforts. This more than offset negative regulatory impacts, mostly model changes, and deductions for dividends and share buybacks. Let me now discuss the growth and balance across our business on Slide 3. The Corporate Bank delivered a post-tax RoTE of 17% in the past nine months. Strong revenue growth, combined with flat adjusted costs driven by tight expense discipline, produced operating leverage of 24%. Our momentum with key clients is encouraging; we saw an increase of around 40% in incremental deals won with multinational corporate clients which will drive future revenues. Our client focus, strong core capabilities and standing as an innovative thought leader in the market have been evidenced by The Banker's Transaction Banking Awards 2023, where Deutsche Bank has been voted Best Bank for Cash Management as well as Transaction Bank of the Year for Western Europe for the second consecutive year. In the Investment Bank, we have a well-diversified business portfolio, supported by our leading Financing business, which contributed \u20ac2.2 billion or approximately 35% of FIC revenues, year-to-date. We have invested into our Origination & Advisory business, taking advantage of market opportunities which are expected to drive future revenues, including through the acquisition of Numis, which we recently completed. We are also seeing clear signs of recovery in the market, led by Debt Origination. Turning to the Private Bank, the business grew revenues attracted inflows of \u20ac22 billion, supported by new money campaigns, and made further progress in streamlining our distribution channels. And finally, we also grew volumes in Asset Management. Assets under management grew by \u20ac38 billion, including \u20ac17 billion of net inflows in the first nine months of 2023, driven by strong inflows into Passive, including Xtrackers. The business launched 18 new products in the third quarter alone, including our first thematic ETFs in the U.S. market. To sum up, we delivered revenues of \u20ac28.5 billion in the last 12 months to September 30th, up over 6% versus the equivalent prior period. We also see forward momentum from net inflows, investments, and business wins with key clients. Our businesses are strongly complementary and well balanced. All of this supports our conviction that we will continue to grow our franchise and exceed our revenue growth targets. Now let me turn to the progress we\u2019re making to accelerate the execution of our Global Hausbank strategy on Slide 4. First, on revenues, with compound annual revenue growth of 6.9% over 2021, we are well on track to outperform on our revenue growth target of 3.5% to 4.5%. And we will continue to benefit from the higher rate environment which drives sustainable performance in the Private Bank and Corporate Bank. We also made progress with our own initiatives that are expected to drive fee income. We are confident that the new addition to the family, Deutsche Numis, will enable us to take added advantage of an expected pickup in corporate finance activity. With \u20ac39 billion of net asset inflows in nine months, we expect the growth of our assets under management to drive fee income in future quarters. Second, on operational efficiencies, our existing savings measures are largely proceeding in line with or ahead of plan. This includes streamlining of front-to-back processes and headcount management. We are also optimizing our distribution network and we have reduced branches by more than 90 over the first nine months of 2023. And this enabled us to keep our adjusted costs essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter, despite absorbing inflationary pressures and investments in growth and controls, and we continue to work on further measures. And third, turning to capital efficiencies, as I mentioned earlier, we have made considerable progress on several fronts. We have already delivered, after two quarters around \u20ac10 billion of the \u20ac15 billion to \u20ac20 billion RWA reduction we planned by the end of 2025. Other measures are already ongoing, mainly focused on hedging and reductions in sub-hurdle lending. And, given progress to date, we have identified additional opportunities to reduce RWAs further, and this enables us to raise our target by \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion. Let\u2019s now discuss what this means for us on Slide 5. As just mentioned, we will deliver a further RWA reduction of around \u20ac10 billion from our capital optimization measures. And on top of this, we now anticipate a lower impact from Basel III, by \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac15 billion, which James will discuss in a moment. Taken together, these two factors give us potential to free up additional capital of around \u20ac3 billion through 2025. We believe that our enhanced capital outlook will support accelerated and expanded distributions to shareholders while increasing our ability to invest in our platforms to boost growth and profitability. We will deliver this by sharpening our business model around capital-light and at-scale businesses, while applying rigorous hurdle rates to our portfolios to drive returns. As we look to 2025 and beyond, we see a clear opportunity to shift gears through a self-reinforcing process of franchise growth, operating leverage, and increased returns, and to create more lasting value for our shareholders as our Global Hausbank grows. With that, let me hand over to James\nJames von Moltke: Thank you, Christian. Let me start with a few key performance indicators on Slide 8 and place them in the context of our 2025 targets. Christian outlined the business momentum and our well-balanced revenue mix, which resulted in revenue growth of nearly 7% on a compound basis for the last twelve months relative to 2021. This performance puts us well on track to deliver revenue growth above our 2025 target. Our strong revenue growth combined with cost management led to a 2-percentage point improvement in the cost income ratio to 73% and our return on tangible equity was 7% in the first nine months of 2023. These ratios would have improved by almost 5% and 1.8 percentage points if adjusted for higher non-operating costs and if bank levies were apportioned equally across the year. Our capital position remained strong with the CET1 ratio at 13.9% this quarter after absorbing regulatory headwinds and the impact of the share repurchase. Our liquidity metrics also remained strong. LCR was 132%, in line with our target of around 130%, and the net stable funding ratio was 121%. In short, our performance in the period reaffirms our resilience and our confidence in reaching or exceeding our 2025 targets. With that, let me turn to the third-quarter highlights on Slide 8. Group revenues were \u20ac7.1 billion, up 3% on the third quarter of 2022 or 6% excluding specific items. Non-interest expenses were \u20ac5.2 billion, up 4% year on year, mainly driven by higher non-operating expenses. Non-operating expenses this quarter included litigation charges of \u20ac105 million and \u20ac94 million of restructuring and severance provisions. Adjusted costs increased 2% year-on-year, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac245 million or 20 basis points of average loans. We generated a profit before tax of \u20ac1.7 billion, up 7% year-on-year. Net profit of \u20ac1.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year reflecting an effective tax rate of 30% compared to 23% in the prior year quarter. Our cost income ratio was 72.4% and our post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 7.3% in the quarter. Diluted earnings per share was $0.56 in the third quarter and tangible book value per share was \u20ac27 and $0.74, up 5% year-on-year. Let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results, starting with interest revenues on Slide 9, average interest earning assets increased by \u20ac6 billion quarter-on-quarter, driven by the increase in our deposit levels, led by the Corporate Bank. Net interest margin in the Corporate Bank declined by approximately 25 basis points due lower lending income and a higher cost of liquidity reserves; however, net interest income on the corporate deposit books remained stable over the quarter. Net interest margin in the Private Bank remained broadly stable in the third quarter. Overall, our deposit betas continue to outperform our models. At the Group level NIM is down 12 basis points of which approximately 5 basis points relates to an accounting impact in C&O, similar to the first quarter, and the balance relates to the NIM reduction in the Corporate Bank. With that, let\u2019s turn to adjusted costs, on Slide 10. Adjusted costs excluding bank levies were \u20ac4.96 billion, in line with the prior quarter and up 2% year-on-year. The increase is driven by inflationary pressures, ongoing investments in controls and business growth which were partially offset by active cost management measures. All cost categories except for other costs were broadly flat to the prior year quarter. The variance in other non-compensation costs includes the non-recurrence of benefits in the prior year quarter, which related to deposit protection cost as well as movements in operational taxes. In addition, we see a normalization of marketing spend and we continue to invest into talent. Let\u2019s now turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 11. Provision for credit losses in the third quarter was \u20ac245 million, equivalent to 20 basis points of average loans. The decline compared to the previous quarter reflected a reversal of approximately \u20ac100 million of Stage 1 and 2 provisions driven by model changes and improved macroeconomic forecasts, mainly impacting the Investment Bank and Corporate Bank. Stage 3 provisions of \u20ac346 million were broadly in line with the previous quarter. Provisions this quarter were driven by the Private Bank and Investment Bank, while the Corporate Bank benefited from a lower level of impairments. For the full year, we continue to expect provisions to land at the upper end of our guidance range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans. Before we move on the next two slides starting with Slide 12. Our third quarter Common Equity Tier 1 ratio came in at 13.9%, a 19 basis point increase compared to the previous quarter. Regulatory changes, principally from the go-live of now-approved wholesale and retail models, resulted in a decline of 38 basis points, slightly below the low end of our previous guidance. Optimization initiatives generated 27 basis points from lower Credit Risk RWA, principally reflecting improvements in our data and certain process changes. Further 19 basis points of ratio support came from diligent risk management in our businesses. Finally, 11 basis point increase came from strong organic capital generation, that is net income, offset by deductions for the share buy-back, dividends and AT1 coupons. Building on Christian\u2019s earlier comments, let me give updated guidance on our capital outlook on Slide 13. As mentioned, regulatory changes led to a reduction of 38 basis points in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. With the go-live of the now-approved wholesale and retail models, the ECB has completed the review of approximately 85% of the relevant portfolio, and we expect only a limited ratio impact from the remainder. Next, we announced in the first quarter of this year a targeted \u20ac15 billion to \u20ac20 billion RWA reduction by end of 2025 through several capital optimization initiatives. We accelerated some of the anticipated data and process optimization initiatives into the third quarter which brings the cumulative RWA reductions to \u20ac10 billion to-date. The work we have done over the past several months gives us the confidence to increase the original target by \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion. Lastly, let me touch on our Basel III estimates, the latest review of our impact assessments indicates an RWA increase of only around \u20ac15 billion compared to the \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion, we have previously guided. The majority of the improvement comes from our Market Risk and Credit Valuation Adjustment, FRTB program, the impact estimates for which matured significantly. Credit Risk estimates are still under review and remain dependent on final CRR3 legislative text. Overall, let me highlight that current estimates are based on our interpretation of current draft regulation and therefore remain subject to change. Cumulatively, these changes in our outlook are significant and support Christian's earlier statements relating to our enhanced ability to execute our strategy and improve our return profile. Let's now turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 15. Corporate Bank revenues in the third quarter were \u20ac1.9 billion, 21% higher year-on-year driven by an improved interest rate environment and pricing discipline with double-digit growth across all client segments. Sequentially, revenues decreased slightly due to lower net interest income from lending and a higher cost of liquidity reserves. However, pricing discipline in our deposit businesses remained exceptionally strong, with limited pass-through and higher business volumes, resulting in strong deposit income. We continue to anticipate a normalization of our deposit revenues over the coming quarters which we expect to be partially offset by growing non-interest-rate-sensitive revenue streams, including commissions and fees. Loan volume in the Corporate Bank was \u20ac117 billion, down by \u20ac12 billion compared to the prior year quarter, but \u20ac1 billion higher compared to the low point in the prior quarter. Deposits were \u20ac286 billion, \u20ac15 billion higher than in the second quarter, with growth in both overnight and term balances in Euro and U.S. dollar and essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter, despite the market events in March. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac11 million or 4 basis points of average loans. The decrease compared to the prior quarter reflects a lower number of impairments in the third quarter and further benefits from Stage 3 recoveries as well as model changes impacting Stage 1 and 2 performing loans. Non-interest expenses were \u20ac1.1 billion, a decrease of 2% year on year driven by FX movements. Sequentially, expenses decreased by 7%, predominantly driven by the non-repetition of litigation charges. Profit before tax was \u20ac805 million in the quarter, doubling year-on-year and driving the post-tax return on tangible equity to 18.3%, with the cost income ratio at 57%. I'll now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 16. Revenues for the third quarter were essentially flat excluding the impact of DVA and 4% lower year-on-year on a reported basis. FIC Sales & Trading decreased by 12% against what was a strong prior year quarter. Rates, Foreign Exchange and Emerging Markets revenues were all lower compared to a very strong prior year quarter and reflected a less volatile market environment. Financing revenues remained strong on an absolute basis, though down year-on-year, due to the non-repeat of a material episodic item in the prior year quarter. Credit Trading revenues were significantly higher driven by ongoing improvements in the flow business and continued strong performance in Distressed. Moving to Origination & Advisory, revenues were up over three-fold, materially driven by the non-recurrence of leveraged lending markdowns in the prior year. However, excluding these markdowns, Origination & Advisory performance was still significantly higher and outperformed the industry fee pool. Debt Origination revenues were significantly higher benefitting from the non-repeat of the aforementioned markdowns and improved LDCM performance, which saw a partial recovery in both the industry fee pool and our market share versus the prior year. Advisory revenues were significantly lower reflecting a decline in the industry fee pool. However, as previously stated, with signs that deal activity is starting to recover, we expect our investments in Origination & Advisory to result in a significant improvement in performance into 2024. Non-interest expenses and adjusted costs were both essentially flat year-on-year. Risk-weighted assets were broadly stable year-on-year. Leverage decreased year-on-year driven by the impact of foreign exchange movements. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac63 million, or 25 basis points of average loans. The decrease versus the prior year was primarily driven by model changes affecting Stage 1 and 2 performing loans, partially offsetting Stage 3 impairments from Commercial Real Estate. Turning to the Private Bank on Slide 17. Revenues were up 3% year-on-year or 9% if adjusted for specific items in the prior year period which related to Sal. Oppenheim workout activities. Net interest income was essentially flat quarter-on-quarter, and higher deposit revenues in the third quarter were mainly offset by higher mortgage hedging costs following the Postbank transition, which were held centrally before. In the Private Bank Germany, revenues increased by 16% due to higher deposit revenues. A decline in fee income mainly reflected changes in contractual conditions impacting insurance products. Reported revenues in the International Private Bank were down 13% or up 2% year-on-year if adjusted for the non-recurrence of both specific revenue items in the prior year quarter and revenues from the divested Financial Advisory business in Italy, as well as FX impacts. Growth was driven by deposit products in Europe which were in part offset by continued client deleveraging in Asia. Revenues in Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs declined by 21% or 3%, if adjusted for the aforementioned effects. Revenues in Premium Banking increased by 14%, supported by higher interest rates. Turning to costs. The increase of noninterest expenses mainly reflects continued higher internal service cost allocations including investments in controls as well as restructuring provisions and severance related to strategy execution. The prior year period included a benefit from deposit protection costs. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac174 million or 27 basis points of average loans in the quarter and included an impact of approximately \u20ac25 million driven by the temporary operational backlog at Postbank. Overall, credit quality remained stable across our portfolios. The Private Bank attracted net inflows of \u20ac9 billion in the quarter with \u20ac6 billion in AUM deposits and \u20ac3 billion in investment products. Let me continue with Asset Management on Slide 18. My usual reminder, the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Assets under management remained stable at \u20ac860 billion in the quarter, supported by net inflows and positive FX effects, largely offset by \u20ac13 billion of market depreciation. Net inflows were primarily in Passive, continuing the momentum in our Xtrackers products we have seen throughout the year. As you will have seen in their results, DWS saw a decline in revenues compared to the prior year; however, with slightly lower non-interest expenses, profit before tax was essentially flat. This development principally reflected a 6% decline in management fees to \u20ac589 million due to prior year declines in assets under management, driven by net outflows excluding cash and market developments in 2022, as well as FX movements. Performance fees declined by \u20ac19 million. Other revenues declined due to lower mark-to-market valuations of co-investments, partly offset by favorable outcome of deferred compensation hedges. Non-interest expenses and adjusted costs were both 8% lower than the prior year. Compensation costs were lower driven by a significant decline in carried interest expense, partially due to lower performance fees in the period. Non-compensation costs were also lower, reflecting effective cost reductions across almost all cost categories. Profit before tax of \u20ac109 million in the quarter was down 18% compared to the prior year reflecting revenue performance. The cost income ratio for the quarter was 75% and return on tangible equity was 13%. Moving to Corporate & Other on Slide 19. Corporate & Other reported a pre-tax loss of \u20ac195 million this quarter versus a pre-tax loss of \u20ac28 million in the third quarter of 2022. This year-on-year change was driven in part by valuation and timing differences, which were positive \u20ac158 million in this quarter, versus \u20ac199 million the prior year quarter. The V&T result in this quarter was driven in particular by the reversal of prior period losses. Expenses associated with shareholder activities were \u20ac170 million in the quarter, compared to \u20ac144 million in the prior year quarter. And, the pre-tax loss associated with legacy portfolios was negative \u20ac137 million, driven primarily by litigation charges. Turning to the Group outlook for the full year on Slide 20. We remain focused on delivering positive operating leverage, as we drive our revenue growth initiatives and execute our cost reduction measures. We now expect full year 2023 revenues to be around \u20ac29 billion. Our noninterest expenses will be slightly higher reflecting a series of non-operating items; however, we expect our adjusted costs to remain essentially flat, in line with our guidance. Provision for credit losses is expected at the upper end of the 25 to 30 basis points range of average loans for the full year. Thinking ahead, our fourth quarter earnings are expected to be impacted by a number of one-off items, both positive and negative, including an accounting impairment of the goodwill from the Numis acquisition, a potential restitution payment from a national resolution fund, further restructuring and severance, as well as year-end tax adjustments. And finally, as both Christian and I have mentioned earlier, our capital outlook is substantially improved by further RWA reductions we have identified and we plan to engage with supervisors on the scope for further additional distributions to shareholders. With that, let me hand back to Silke and we look forward to your questions.\nSilke Szypa: Thank you very much. Operator, we are ready to take the questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Nicolas Payen from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.\nNicolas Payen: I have two please, on capital. The first one is on your increased capital efficiency. Could you give us a bit more color on how you managed to increase your reduction targets by \u20ac10 billion? And also regarding the \u20ac3 billion of potential additional freed up capital to 2025, what does it mean for your capital distribution and your targeted \u20ac8 billion shareholders distribution? Should we expect a meaningful increase as soon as next year? And then on the regulatory capital outlook and the improved Basel III outlook, is the new guidance related to the input floor? And also do you have any chance regarding your output for guidance? Thank you.\nChristian Sewing: Well, good morning, and thank you, Nico, for your question. Let me take the first part and then I hand over to James. Look, let me start that this is a very important and I think very good day for Deutsche Bank, because I think what we show now also on the capital side is nothing else than further evidence that our long-term strategy and obviously, the diligent execution around it is paying off more and more and obviously more to come. To your capital distribution question and how we did arrive, yes, it's a good day for shareholders, with material progress on our capital measures and scope to freeing up additional capital of the mentioned \u20ac3 billion from now through 2025. And as both James and I said in our prepared remarks, we see the outlook improvements regarding capital efficiency and Basel IV is providing us with the opportunity to both accelerate and expand our distribution right path. Amongst other things, it gives us the confidence to go beyond our earlier expectations In terms of buyback potential already next year. The better than expected third quarter RWA optimization and the improved outlook are both relatively recent changes and hence and hope you understand that it is a bit too early to provide exact details of how and when, we will be in a position to accelerate exactly this distribution path. And Nico, as you would expect, we are obviously in discussions with our supervisor on the revised capital plan. As we have laid down though a very clear path for dividends, i.e., a 50% increase per year the next two years. Extra distributions would come in form of share buybacks and subject to further dialogue with our supervisors. We would expect a significant proportion of the incremental capital to be distributed to our shareholders. And for instance, one way to think about this trajectory, Nico, from here is that it gives us the opportunity to move to a 50% payout ratio sooner than we initially expected. So I think at this point, we can safely say that shareholder distributions is a key priority for Deutsche Bank and for more details, I hand over to James.\nJames von Moltke: Sure. Thank you, Christian, and Nicolas, thank you for the question. So to give you a little bit of color on what is the optimization been that we've accomplished so far. You've seen us do three securitizations over the past couple of quarters including one on the Italian consumer portfolio in this quarter, and so that's been sort of quicker and more effective than we might have expected. And then when we talk about data and process improvements, the data is quite powerful, and by the way, this is where also we're getting the Postbank portfolio onto the same systems as DB is helpful, because we're able to apply, for example, SME support factors, infra support factors on the portfolio, in a way that we couldn't in the prior landscape. So it's enhancing the data, enhancing the way that our portfolio, if you like interacts with the rules. We think there's still a distance to go with that. And although we've worked on it for years, as rules change, one always finds additional optimization measures, so that's been very encouraging. If I think about, your question about input, output put floors on Basel III, we've really been focused on the 1125 impact and, as you've seen, dramatic improvement based on better visibility into the FRTB models as we mentioned. At this point, the output floor is still some years away, so I think of that as biting maybe in 2030. If you want guidance, we would probably stick with the 30 billion impact, at that point, but to be fair, we haven't really done this next round of mitigation in terms of portfolio shifts and what have you, so that's still a long way out. Hopefully, that helps, Nicolas, on your questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Terelak from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nAdam Terelak: I have one on capital and one on revenues. I appreciate you don't want to front run exactly, what we're going to look, what this is going to look like in the short-term, but you're on the tape this morning discussing higher payout next year than in your original planning. Can you confirm that that original plan was the plus 50% on the buyback to match the dividend increase? And can you also discuss whether we can look at more regular capital return over the next few years rather than having to wait for full year results each year? Secondly, on revenues, NII clearly stepped back in corporate bank, Private Bank this quarter. That's kind of been guided to, but can you give us some more color about the shape from here and use that to reference your confidence in revenue growth for the group into 2024?\nChristian Sewing: Look, let me start on briefly again on the capital question. And again, I think it's good order to discuss all the details with our regulator first. But I think you're right, the 50% dividend pass, we always said, and we also said that this is quite a good guidance for our past guidance on the share buybacks. So in this regard, I think you have a good assumption. And as I just said, I think with the scope now of the additional 3 billion. Obviously, we would like and we intend then to start increasing the share buyback already in 2024, beyond that what we already communicated in our previous correspondence. So clearly an acceleration and expansion that's our goal and that will focus now -- this is our focus in our discussions with the regulators going forward. With regard to the revenues, I will hand over to James for more details in particular when it comes to NII. But also here I think very good messages because the clear jump off point for 2024 is now the 29 billion in 2023. You have seen a good development in the third quarter. Again, a very stable development also by the way on the NII side in both Corporate Bank and Private Bank, We see that momentum going forward into Q4 and therefore there is a high confidence in delivering 29 billion number for the full year 2023. On top of that, and I think we refer to that in our previous calls already. The geopolitical environment, the economic environment is something where at the end of the day, the advice which is asked by the clients, on the private banking side, on the corporate banking side, also with regard to our investment banking services is increasing and increasing. And therefore, we also said in our prepared remarks a 40% increase in mandated deals from the corporates in these first nine months of 2023 versus the same time period of 2022 is just one signal how much we are actually and see the momentum with our corporate clients around the world to think about how to best position in these geopolitical situations where we are. And hence, in particular also the investments which we are doing on the corporate side, in the investment banking on the advisory side, the investments which we have done on the wealth management side, now the finalization of the Numis transaction will grow also the non-NII business in 2024 a lot. And therefore, seeing the stability actually also in the NII business in 2023 plus the growth we see from the advisory, our clear goal is to show a 2024 revenue number of 30 billion. Regarding the composition, James will outline further but we can see a momentum which is simply unbroken.\nJames von Moltke: So, Adam couple of things on your comments, well let me start with the comment that our group NII number is a very noisy line and we've talked about it before the impact of the FX swap book and therefore the rate differential between euros and dollars plays a role here as does hedging results and other parts of the treasury piece, which is why it's actually I think more instructive to look at the net interest income and the margins of the businesses especially PB and CB. Now, there we show you margins that were actually reasonably stable quarter-on-quarter, some pressure in PB and CB rather. But interestingly this quarter the principal drivers were not the deposit margins. There was again noisy even at that level around mortgage hedging for example in the private bank, you know the excess of deposits over loans impacting the margin in the Corporate Bank, so things outside of the deposit margins. That difference was about 130 million if you take the two businesses together. We think Q4 will be about the same level, so flat to that. Really as deposit margins come in a little bit, but some of this other noise kind of clears through the system. So as Christian says, we feel good about the trajectory looking forward one even two quarters in those two businesses. And that of support, of course, supports our view going into to 2024. I think the other thing just briefly you mentioned on the timing of the buyback and distribution announcements, it's a fair point. It would take a lot of pressure off of us and the supervisors to do this more frequently and let's see is the short version. We want to -- the nice thing is if you split it out over the year, you can be a little bit more dynamic to the market environment and conditions. On the other hand, I think to some degree shareholders have sought the greatest degree of confidence as early as possible. So we're going to need to balance those two things but I could certainly envisage multiple requests in the year going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Hallam from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChris Hallam: Just two from my side first on cost. Could you give us a sense of the size of the inflation headwinds you were able to offset and underlying costs in the quarter and maybe also where you'd expect to end the year given the Q4 one offs you flagged and how that sets the business up heading into 2024? And then secondly, maybe looking a bit further out to 2025, obviously, the revenue momentum is working out in your favor as you just discussed, but there's also still a disconnect between your targets on cost to income ratio and return on tangible equity for 2025 and the latest consensus. So just what are the main moving parts over the next two years that give you confidence on reiterating those 2025 targets?\nChristian Sewing: Yes. Potentially, I start on your second part and obviously James shall add. Look on the difference in the 2025 targets I think it comes from both sides. Number one, a further increasing revenue line James just outlined, the 2024 pass, our confidence in the 30 billion in 2024. And obviously, we see that momentum also going then into the next year in 2025. And in particular in 2025 as we always said before, we have another NII tailwind actually in the private bank, which is not to be underestimated. So therefore, on the revenue side, Chris, further growth to be seen clearly. On the cost side, I'm really confident, because you know that we have given the goal of 2.5 billion, 2 billion already with our IDD in 2022. These 2 billion is actually based on our so-called key deliverables, i.e., the Germany optimization, the front to back, the technology architecture, the infrastructure efficiencies, real estate savings and so on. And there we really have a high confidence to deliver these 2 billion based on all the structural work which we have done over the last the 18 months since the IDD and we can see progress every quarter. On the remaining 500 million, obviously we are working diligently but also there good progress. We discussed with you the reduction in force program in April. We have actioned on that. We have 900 reduction delivering more than 100 million of annualized savings now from now on starting. James said it this morning rightly so. We have additional measures, which are now in execution and in flight that we further reduce our workforce. By the way, also with regard to the overall remediation which we have seen over the last years, we can see now that we think we have seen the peak in our workforce and we will further reduce. And this, if you want to mention it reduction in force 2.0 will be from a size and number bigger than the reduction we have seen in April 1.0. So that is the next part. And in line with our goal of achieving these additional 500 million, obviously, we are doing other things like third-party spending whether it's consulting marketing spending, which will save us a meaningful number also in 2024 versus 2023. We are obviously also with the peak in workforce which we have seen. We are obviously very selective and cautious also when it comes to new hirings. And in this regard, we have very good side on the 2.5 billion. That with the growing revenue number, which I just outlined. We are in full confidence that we can achieve the 10% or what we always wanted to do and where we still stand by to actually exceed the 10% RoTE in 2025.\nJames von Moltke: So Chris just on your inflation question and perhaps a little bit more on the targets. So inflation, it depends very much on what you're looking at. Compensation costs, elements of non-compensation for example software, there can be quite varied impacts. But I would say we're facing across the world, probably 4% to 5% inflation on average in both comp and non-comp costs that we need to work to offset. So far, I think we've been quite successful, in both line items. You need to work very hard on workforce composition. As Christian outlined, we've got a lot of measures underway there whether it's internalization, location strategy or just managing with discipline across the Company. And then on the non-comp, you've really got to focus on demand. And that's where I think that, passing some of the what I'll call the inflection points that we've been passing whether that's you know technology implementations, whether that's, control investment remediation, it does give us more flexibility to manage the demand side there. And so that gives us some comfort. If I think to run rates which I think was embedded in the second part of your question. We've talked over the course of the year about run rates, maybe made it too complex for you, but we're trying to manage in that 4.95 billion to let's say, 5 billion per quarter in adjusted cost range. We've had some pressure this year not just in inflation which I think we've been successful offsetting but also some of the investments that we've been making. In the fourth quarter, we may have some additional sort of unexpected costs associated with Postbank remediation that may push us up closer to or perhaps slightly above the 5 billion level in Q4 with all of that baked in including the additional Numis costs. I think we've talked about 4.975 billion back in July. But overall, a continued sort of evidence of I think discipline and control across the Company. That would represent a good step off also into 2024, whereas you know the goal that we have and Christian just outlined is to continue to crystallize these cost savings measures in order to manage overall flat notwithstanding inflation and investments.\nOperator: The next question comes from Anke Reingen from RBC. Please go ahead.\nAnke Reingen: I have two questions. First is on the backlog following the Postbank IT migration. Can you talk a bit about the implications on costs? I think you just mentioned it and revenues near-term, and is there also risk as in, it could potentially delay, the target of cost savings? And if you can please talk about, I mean, if you can, about what we might expect in terms of potential actions by, BaFin could it be like fines operational risks or similar? And then secondly on the NII or the headwinds to your revenues in the Corporate Bank, the higher funding costs. Should we expect you increase the deposit collection further in Q4 and expect further headwinds? And is this related to, TLTRO maturities? I mean, I guess it offsets the benefit of the higher rates, so how much more of a headwind should we see there?\nJames von Moltke: I'll try to be brief. Look, we don't see a revenue impact of the Postbank integration or operational backlog issues and we wouldn't necessarily expect one going forward. Obviously, we want to work hard to put these issues behind us and sort of pivot to a very different customer experience and that's the focus of the management team there. You've seen, a cost of provisioning cost impact in Q3 that could also extend into Q4, but ultimately, we would expect to get that back as really we get back on track in terms of the collections activity where there's been some diversion of the operational staff. So call it zero or close to zero in those two lines when all is said done. On expenses, it's probably been in the high-single-digits in Q3, in terms of the remediation costs and if you kind of look to that in Q4, somewhere between 30 million to 35 million of incremental spend on the remediation, but we would expect that to tail off relatively quickly in 2024 as we put the operational issues behind us. And frankly invest in automation and improved capabilities going forward, so we feel it'll be a temporary impact. As it relates to sort of crystallizing the long-term benefits of the unity project, no change there, we're at work in app decommissioning and the various elements of the project that, particularly on the technology side, we're going to drive, the benefits, too early to make any comments on fines, frankly. We're working very closely with the BaFin, collaboratively with them and the monitor, and I think our interests are very well aligned that we want to put the backlog behind us and cease any disruption to our clients. On the liquidity and funding costs, it's interesting. I mentioned earlier that it's this excess of liabilities over assets in the corporate bank that can sometimes be a drag. The interesting sort of corollary there is we haven't yet seen a benefit in the NIM of loan growth. And so for the Corporate Bank in particular and then at the group level, we would benefit from putting the deposits to use. We're looking forward and believe that we should start to get some momentum in terms of loan growth going forward, and hence that imbalance can begin to help us. As it relates to TLTRO, you've seen that you've prefunded some of the maturities, the December maturities, and so TLTRO is becoming a less and less impactful, sort of part of our overall balance sheet and funding profile. Yes, there's a little bit of a drag going into 24% coming in that, but that, at this point is in sort of low very low double digits per quarter in the coming several quarters.\nChristian Sewing: We just had one point, Anke, to your first question, and James is absolutely right that there we don't expect an impact on our revenues just to support that in Q3 '23 versus the previous year Q3. We increased in particular the German private banking business by 16%. And I think this is another evidence actually that from a revenue point of view, it is so far not affecting us and I also don't expect that. And I have to say what the people in the private bank are doing in Germany is a fantastic job. Actually, A, to make sure that we reduce the backlog and we are doing really good progress, and secondly, actually take care of our clients. So really good job done and I think it's evident in this third quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mate Nemes from UBS. Please go ahead.\nMate Nemes: Good morning and thank you for your presentation. I have two questions please. The first one, I want to go back to the 3 billion potential additional capital freed up in the next two years as a result of Basel IV and an RWA reduction. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense to what extent do you expect actually to deploy some of that additional capital into the business organically or perhaps inorganically? And if so, what are the areas where you see perhaps and clear opportunities for that redeployment, and mindful that you mentioned that significant proportion is obviously for distribution? So that's the first question. And the second question is on the Corporate Bank. And I just wanted to pick up on the comment from you James on so far you haven't put those additional deposits into work. Yet we're seeing a very small uptick in loans in the corporate bank. So, the combination of the two suggests perhaps you have somewhat of a better outlook in terms of deployment and new lending, if you could just share your thoughts on that? Thank you.\nJames von Moltke: Yes, Mate, thank you very much for the question, and it's a great question. We've spent some time looking at this actually, and I want to give you a little bit of sort of color looking at the last seven quarters of where the capital has gone. So on average, we've generated about 27 basis points of capital, each quarter over the last year and change, and this is what's interesting. About a third of that has gone to support the distributions that we've been making so far, the 1.75 billion. About a third has gone into the regulatory changes, and about a third has gone into the ratio improvement up to now close to 14%. Almost none has gone into the business so far, and one of the reasons we think this sort of inflection point is so important is, first of all, we think we can step up the profitability, so the 27 basis points doesn't, by any means, have to be the cap in terms of what we can generate. But I think there is scope to increase the business deployment beyond, where what we've been doing the past couple of years especially as that reg build falls away, and we're at a ratio level now that is entirely comfortable for us in terms of buffers. So, there is capacity both for business deployment and for significant, distribution increases. Now to your point about Corporate Bank, yes, revenue loan growth in the past year and change has been quite slow across both businesses. And we'd like to think that there's, again, some signs of life. You mentioned a small increase, about 1 billion in the quarter in loans in the Corporate Bank. We've been waiting for that to come. We'd like to see it, and we think we may see it already in the fourth quarter, but then extending into 2024. And with our loan to deposit ratio now again below 80%, we have the capacity to support loan growth both from a capital and from a funding perspective. So we do think, we're turning the corner in terms of the ability to redeploy in both of those senses. In private bank, perhaps a little bit more sluggish. As you know, we've made a decision, not to kind of, emphasize mortgage lending, in Germany both given the market environment and given capital requirements, but we think we have capacity to grow margin lending in wealth management as that comes back to grow unsecured consumer lending. So that may take a little bit longer to come back, but also in that business, there's potential to grow loans to redeploy capital. Lastly, and this came up in a recent conference, we are careful in how we manage the capital that's committed to the investment bank, so those are portfolios that while there is opportunity to grow within our risk appetite. We are careful to manage the capital to that business, devoted to that business within constraints that we set. And so while we think there are attractive lending, opportunities there, we're going to be cautious about growing especially in an environment where there is still some uncertainty in the in credit environment. So look, short version is real capacity now for deployment in the businesses while we're in a very different, environment in terms of distribution potential.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stuart Graham from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nStuart Graham: I had two, please, both on capital. First, can I just press a little bit more on the RWA optimization measures, please? I hear what you say on the I guess, the support factors that you've been optimizing for a long time, and I guess I was surprised to find out that it's now in this one call? [Technical Difficulty] How do you think about the opportunities to invest that 3 billion of extra capital in growing the IB? On the one hand [Technical Difficulty] ex capital off your consensus 25 leverage ratio, I guess, just 4.6% suggest you have a lot of scope if you will [Technical Difficulty] that traffic. Please?\nJames von Moltke: So, Stuart, it's James. You were cutting in and out a little bit, but I'll go with what I believe the questions were and you may need to follow-up. On RWA optimization, to be honest, so are we surprised, we've been, I'd like to think at the more sophisticated end of this type of balance sheet management over the years and to find more opportunity, is on the one hand encouraging, on the other hand you know suggest that there was something left on the table in the past. Now the securitization piece is a step change and what we're looking at and willing to do. But we've, as we've talked about before, we still like the economics of securitization. So we would estimate for example that the revenue to RWA relationship of the securitization we did this quarter was about 1.5% maybe 1.6% and so we can redeploy that capital at better, sort of equity margins call it than that. So there is still more to do. And as I mentioned earlier, you know, as the data environment improves more and more, we see scope to continue optimization. Of course, Basel III is entirely new, so the work on the models there, the visibility into the impact of hedging strategies that's also new. So it's a bit of an ongoing story. The redeployment I talked about a moment ago really to Mate's question. Again, there is scope to support growth in the businesses, but frankly the extra capital that we now have doesn't really change the growth potential of the businesses, and won't change our risk appetite. As you know, we've been disciplined about risk appetite. And we also intend to be different disciplined around capital allocation as I mentioned earlier, especially recognizing that that's a focus of attention around the investment bank. And finally, on the leverage balance sheet, we see them as sort of moving a little bit in tandem. So as our CET1 ratio goes up, so too is the leverage ratio. And while there's a bit more flexibility in managing the leverage balance sheet, we think we can very comfortably remain in the mid to high 4s, over time and if you like optimize the revenue footprint of that leverage balance sheet. So, hopefully, those answered your questions even though there was a little bit of signal challenge.\nStuart Graham: Apologies for that. So you do see, to the extent the U.S. Banks are pulling back because of Basel IV, you do see an opportunity in investment bank or you don't?\nJames von Moltke: Well, what I'd say is the high -- put it this way, the higher CET1 capital base or total capital base supports a leverage balance sheet that's a little bit larger than it has been historically. But I do not see us changing dramatically our strategies put it that way, in terms of leverage deployment. I would think that on a comparative basis, we've been on the more conservative end in terms of the deployment of our leveraged balance sheet. And I don't see that changing dramatically, Stuart, even in light of some of the changes that you're seeing in the U.S.\nChristian Sewing: And Stuart, to James' point with no dramatic changes, I think if you talk to Ram Nayak, he has the clear strategy where he wants to be in Europe but also in the U.S. And that -- where he wants to be in the U.S. was already for him in the plan before the potential changes to the Basel requirements for the U.S. banks. So I agree with James. I think for us, it is good, on the one hand, that there is more capacity, but the strict adherence to risk return and to our capital allocation in this regard will not change. We want to grow our profitability. Now we have a bit more capacity to do this and we will do this, but we will not leave our risk appetite nor our clear reward expectations we have from the businesses.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Hallett from KBW. Please go ahead.\nTom Hallett: I suppose one of the debates for investors has been around the sustainability of profits, and within that, what normalized trading pools look like. If we take this year, it looks like your FIC revenues could land around the 8 billion mark with consensus expecting something similar over the next couple of years. But this is 2.5 billion higher than what we saw in 2018 and '19, and I appreciate the rent environment is very different. There's been a bit of balance sheet growth there as well. So what makes you confident that the 8 billion is sustainable given a pretty well documented normalization of the wider industry? And then secondly, on government taxes, it's been a key theme for the sector over the last few months. And again, I appreciate the impacts on you. Will it be limited so far, but do you see any risk for Germany to follow suit?\nChristian Sewing: Let me start. Look, what makes me confident on the fixed side that this kind of 2.5 billion higher than three or four years ago is something sustainable. It's 3, 4 points, but number one, the healing of the bank. I mean this is the most important if you talk to our institutional clients, but also to the corporate clients. And I cannot even tell you -- and that was our focus, the transformation, the healing and with that obviously the rating upgrades which we have received from all the major rating agencies. That resulted in a completely different way how we can deal with our clients and that a lot of clients actually return to Deutsche Bank. And to be honest, we are still in the documentations of clients who have returned after the last increase and improvement of the rating agencies because you know how long it takes to get the documentation is the agreements, right? And in this regard, I can still see the benefits from that. So the healing of the bank is one of the key reasons. Number two, I think it's the focus which we have given ourselves, and in particular, Ram has done in the FIC business, in the trading business. It was exactly right to focus on that, where we are strong from a regional point of view starting with Europe, then obviously going into our emerging markets franchise also covering Asia, but also investing very focused in the U.S. And Ram has a clear plan how to grow also our FIC business in the U.S. over the next 12 to 18 months, and he put the right investments into that. Number three, it's the front-to-end reengineering of our processes in FIC. Also that is obviously which is not only making us more efficient, but at the end of the day, front-to-end always results in one thing. This is client experience for our clients. And with that, obviously, we make ourselves more attractive to deal with us. So, I think it's the overall healing of the bank but also the real focus and reengineering of the platform Ram has done to the FIC business, which makes me comfortable that the \u20ac8 billion which we have seen so far is a very good number to actually plan for the future and, in my view, if I look at his plan to even increase from there. Nevertheless, always said, we even want to make the investment banking business more balanced and therefore the investments into the O&A businesses. And also in the prepared remarks, we said how stable actually within the FIC business the financing part is. It's 35% of the FIC business. And that is coming through year by year, I think, with a very good and solid underwriting scheme. Regarding government taxes, look, it's always hard for me to judge what is coming. But on this end in Germany, on this side in Germany, I'm very calm. We have clear statements that these kind of excess taxes, I think, is not supported, in particular not by our finance minister. There is really no active discussion on this one. And therefore, it is for me a non-topic.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Lim from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Lim: So firstly on capital, just one clarification here. It doesn't seem like you're prepared to increase the \u20ac8 billion overall capital return envelope, but it does seem that you're more confident on reaching that 50% payout sooner rather than later. Is that the best way to think about it? So that \u20ac3 billion capital, that's being released as it were. That doesn't really become additive to the \u20ac8 billion? And then with that, if you look at your actions to optimize capital and RWAs, I guess that reduces risk weight density. And is that the way you see it? And so that being the case, maybe your guidance on the output floor there. Your comments earlier are that we should maybe stick to the \u20ac30 billion RWA impact there. And just very lastly, on the Corporate Bank NII, it does seem like the largest impact there is from the increase in liquidity reserve costs. What's your expectation there for how that should develop going forward, please?\nJames von Moltke: So Andrew, the answer to the first question is no, that's not the correct way to think about it. So think about it this way. We had a capital commitment to shareholders of \u20ac8 billion at a point in time where our outlook and our step off were weaker than they are today. What we're not able or willing to say at this point is how much of that increment is going to come out to shareholders and how soon. We obviously owe you an answer on that in time, and we'll work through that internally in our capital planning and then with supervisors. But no, we would see it as incremental to the \u20ac8 billion. In terms of optimization, it's complex just because at a point in time, we're going to need to optimize around the output floor. That's not something that we've really done. Ironically, the impetus there would be to take on higher-risk density assets and so sort of optimize in that way. And actually, it goes a little bit also to Stuart's question. The -- what regulation asks you to do now is run this complex optimization algorithm across all of those resources in time. So, it's advanced approaches RWA, it will be standardized approaches RWA and then the leveraged balance sheet, And we're going to need to find the optimal use of the balance sheet under all three of those tests. In the case of the standardized, we have until 2030 when we think the out floor bites. I wouldn't expect -- just on the CB NII piece, I wouldn't expect that to change sequentially in the next couple of quarters. Again, a little bit depending on whether -- on how the loan and deposit sort of trajectory for the business go from here. We'd like to think we can continue to grow deposits and grow the loan balances, but it's the relationship between the two that really drives the question of the liquidity funding in the CB business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kian Abouhossein from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nKian Abouhossein: Thanks for taking my two questions. The first question is related to P&L sensitivity. If you can -- clearly you are hitting the gas pedal right now and driving revenues and then you're doing really well in that back then and then it looks like you're indicating flattish cost. If you have to, if you have to have the break, due to market conditions changing. Can you talk about the flexibility of cost? As you indicate, there's a lot of stickiness, there's inflation in cost, and I just try to understand your flexibility in that respect. How we should think about the elements of cost reduction in a different environment, and how you model that internally? And then secondly, the question is regarding your remarks on cost of risk. You mentioned model changes and improved macro forecast leading to reversals in Stage 1 and 2 provisions. Can you help me understand what's driving this more optimistic outlook, please? And if you could talk a little bit about the health of large corporate and Mittelstand in particular clearly in Europe, sorry, in Germany.\nJames von Moltke: Well, look, we've about this over the years, the P&L sensitivity, and I'd like to think. In fact, I'm confident that both sides of that equation have improved over the last several years. So start with the revenue side, as our revenue mix has shifted over time, I think our revenue sensitivity has declined dramatically, and not just because more of the revenues are coming from the businesses that we describe as more stable, but also because the revenue composition in the Investment Bank, I think has firmed up as well and our market position as Christian has outlined. So, I think that revenue sensitivity is lower than you might think, and by the way you also see us take relatively conservative decisions whether that's about risk type or on our interest rate risk management. So we manage that, it's not just an accident. And then on the cost side I have said over the years that that less is of the cost base is variable than I would like it to be. I think that equation is also changing for the better. Let's start with just the investment profile. As we shift from, I'll call them non-discretionary investments, investments that needed to be made in technology and in controls to a more discretionary profile, we can hit the brakes on those investments. And the other thing is that as we get deeper and deeper into the structural cost saves that Christian outlined, more of the cost base ends up being variable, and that can be variable compensation, but it can also be other elements of the cost base. So, the short version I think we're improving both aspects of that equation Kian relative to where we were a few years ago. On the cost of risk just in the detail there we had \u20ac100 million net on the Stage 1 and 2. Actually what that was a \u20ac100 million model benefit associated with the PD LGDs in the new wholesale and retail models plus about \u20ac30 million of FLI, forward looking indicator benefits, offset by about \u20ac30 million of in Stage 1 and 2 of portfolio changes, including sort of internal ratings and that sort of thing. Now why did the FLI improve? The point in time is always hard to remember, but the last time we booked this on a quarterly basis was in July where the outlook for the soft landing particularly in the U.S. was actually less optimistic than it became through the third quarter, so what you're seeing is a bit of a lag effect as to where things stood at that time.\nChristian Sewing: And Kian, on your last question, I think on the German corporates, large corporates and Mittelstand. Look, we're observing a very stable situation in terms of their credit worthiness. They benefit hugely from the resilience. I think I said it in one of the previous calls if I compare the situation of German Mittelstands clients with 15 years ago, we have a capital ratio, we have a liquidity ratio, liquidity position of those clients which is in much better shape than 15 years ago after the global financial crisis, they all worked on themselves. So, I think despite the no growth situation in Germany, we can really attest a very resilient portfolio. And hopefully with growth coming back in '24, albeit very low growth in '24, we then will also to see that there is obviously growth coming back into those slides. So for the time being also from our rating downgrades versus upgrades, no negative or no deterioration to that what we have seen three or six months ago.\nKian Abouhossein: If I could just briefly follow-up on the cost flexibility and I know I've asked this question, but you're trading at 0.3x tangible book value for a reason and that's a reflection of the concern that in a different scenario, you will not be able to manage cost to some operating leverage, let's put it this way. So can you quantify and give us more confidence in your cost stability and managing your cost stability in a different scenario?\nChristian Sewing: Look, let me start and James will follow-up. First of all, I do believe that it's most important for our credibility that we achieve those cost targets which we have given to the market and we will do so. That's therefore, I ran you through the structural cost savings and that what we now put on top actually in order to get to the 2.5 billion. Secondly, of course, if this would happen, you have three or four layers, of course, where we can very quickly reduce the spending. That is the variable comp which means -- with regard to investments. Obviously, we are reviewing those investments on a quarterly basis. Also adhering, obviously, to the profile on the business side and whether the performance is the right one. I think we have a very good monitoring in place on this one. Secondly, yes, there is always the flexibility on the variable comp, which we obviously would adjust to the performance -- to the revenue performance. I think we have also shown that in the past that we are able to do this, and we will do this. So this is obviously, if you look at our variable comp, that is not an insignificant number, which we could reduce like for the CTB, i.e., change the bank investment. And then you have those items where Rebecca is going actively after already now but which also plays into this one, which is everything on third-party costs, which means also consultancy, which means marketing. And easily in this regard from a flexibility point of view, Kian, you are in a very high 3-digit million number. And in this regard, I would say this bank has clearly the ability to react. But most important for us is obviously to first of all deliver that what we promised to you and this is the \u20ac2.5 billion.\nOperator: The next question comes from Timo Dums from DZ Bank. Please go ahead.\nTimo Dums: I've got two please. One is on Q4 and the other question is on O&A. So starting with Q4, maybe you could provide specifics on the one-offs you flagged for the current quarter. So a quantification maybe on the restitution of the National Resolution Fund and the year-end adjustments, tax adjustments that you mentioned that would be helpful? So this would be my question number one. And my second question is on the outlook on O&A. So again, a strong recovery here. So what's your view on the last quarter? Should we expect another pickup despite the seasonal patterns? And what are your expectations looking further down the road?\nJames von Moltke: Briefly on the second question, yes, we would see a continued improvement sequentially in O&A, and we would look to a much more significant improvement going in then to 2024. So, we're optimistic there. On the Q4 one-offs, why don't I meet you halfway? On the DTA, I would expect and here it's a different geography from last year, where the DTA related to the U.S. I would size it today at about 5 million of opportunity in the tax line, potentially larger. It all depends on our forward-looking view of profitability in the UK entities and jurisdiction going forward. That's to the positive. The Numis goodwill, it's too early to give an exact number given we're going through the purchase price allocation process sort of as we speak. But to give you a ballpark, I would expect us to book about \u20ac250 million in -- as a non-operating cost around that Numis goodwill. The numbers that I can't really guide you on today would be, one, the restitution payment to the upside. And then as you all know, restructuring and severance and legal litigation items are always subject to some uncertainty. And so as we get more visibility, if we get an opportunity, we'll give you an update on that. I'd like to think the net of those four things is biased to the positive, but we have to wait and see how it all plays out.\nOperator: The next question comes from Giulia Miotto from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nGiulia Miotto: So, the first one on CRE, commercial real estate. Thank you for the detail provided in the slides at the back. If I compare your level of provisioning, especially on the U.S. side with what U.S. banks have been seeing so far this quarter, it seems like you have -- your provisions are lower. I was wondering what gives you the confidence of these passively lower provisions in these markets specifically, especially for U.S. office, which seems particularly challenged? And then on Numis, I know it's early days. The acquisition closed 13th of October, I believe. But I was wondering if you have any early thoughts that you would like to share now that this is part of Deutsche Bank. And then a quick technical one. DTAs, with all these DTAs being written back, what's the benefit for the tax rate in the coming years?\nJames von Moltke: Thanks, Julia. So I'll try to -- well, starting with CRE, it's just hard to say because we have no insight into our competitors' portfolios. And so we can tell you what we think of ours. And as we've said sort of consistently from the start of this cycle, we think we have a high-quality portfolio. It's -- to the extent it's concentrated -- obviously, there's an office exposure, but it's concentrated in Class A strong sponsors and what have you. And what we -- but we're happy to share this time in the appendix material is, frankly, the experience that we've had. So now we're sort of four, five quarters into this cycle in commercial real estate. And we think that the relationship between the loan modifications and the expected credit losses that arise from that speak to the quality of the portfolio. Now that, we're, call it, halfway through that. But you can see that if trends continue or even deteriorate a little bit, this should be an entirely manageable situation for that. Coverage is hard to measure on a comparative basis. But we think we're taking provisions and collateral allowance and collateral together. We think we're sort of reasonably in line with the peers. On Numis, we're very excited about the transaction. I mean, the first few days and the process with the Deutsche Numis organization have been very successful. Both the Deutsche U.K. corporate finance team going into Numis and the relationship with the Numis leadership and staff is off to a great start, and the client feedback has been extremely positive ever since the announcement. So, it's early days in terms of revenue production, if you like, but we're very encouraged by what we see so far. Ultimately, on the DTA, it doesn't really affect the tax rate. So you should expect us to advise an effective tax rate continuing to be in the sort of 29% to 30% range, going forward, always a little bit of variation in that. But the DTAs are one-off. And I would think of it as complete, if you like, this year when we revalue the U.K. tax characteristics.\nOperator: The next question comes from Amit Goel from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nAmit Goel: So just coming back on the cost base. Obviously, you've reiterated the conviction in terms of getting down to that kind of \u20ac18.5 billion, \u20ac19 billion type level. I'm just curious, I mean, I think unless you change the exit rate for this year, it's a bit higher than the level achieved this year or will be. So I mean, when should we expect to see those costs coming out? So would that be more in the second half of '24 or into '25? Or could it be sooner? And then secondly, just related to that, I mean, if costs proved to be a bit more sticky, are you seeing potential distribution of the RWA efficiency savings as the other or another lever to help get to that 10% RoTE target or above? Or are these kind of just two very independent things? And then just one follow-up, I guess you just mentioned, obviously, on PB, the revenue tailwind in 2025. I was just wondering if you can potentially size that or give us an indication of how much you're expecting from that.\nJames von Moltke: Sure. Thanks, Amit. Look, actually, the middle part of your question is a really good one. The RWA and the RoTE are, in fact, linked. And ironically, you start to have denominator problem and, therefore, a strong incentive to distribute capital in order not to have the RoTE dragged down by higher tangible equity. In fact, you're seeing that already this year. The biggest part of the RoTE decline in the third quarter versus last year was just higher capital. The tax rate played a big impact as well. But leaving that aside, it's higher capital. So we are incentivized to push out capital. If I think about the exit rate, yes, the 5% is a little higher than we'd like it to be. And to your point, to get to a full year number of adjusted costs in line with this year, we would need to start bringing it down in the second half. But look, if we're traveling in the 4.9 to 5 area next year in each of the four quarters, we think we're doing okay. And we will -- to Kian's earlier question, we think we've got more levers to help to drive that going forward. On the tailwind into '25, this is some distance ahead, but I would quantify it as \u20ac200 million to \u20ac300 million just from the deposit hedges kind of rolling over, so a nice tailwind for that business, for the PB business going forward.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Jeremy Sigee from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Sigee: Just a couple of quick numbers questions, please. The expectation was that you'd be getting to just over \u20ac400 billion of RWAs in 2025. If I adjust that for the undershoot today, the extra savings, the Basel IV, it would come out more like \u20ac370 billion. Is that a fair expectation? Or is it likely to be higher than that with redeployment? So that's my first question. And then different numbers question on NII, you've talked a bit about deposit NII pressure in 4Q. If rates stay at this level and beta gets to its sort of medium-term resting place and also term assets re-price fully, what would we be subtracting and adding to NII? And I'm particularly focused on the Corporate Bank and the Private Bank. So just those two big numbers, if we fully did the beta and fully re-priced any term assets that take time, what would we be adding and subtracting?\nJames von Moltke: So Jeremy, on the RWA, I would -- in brief, I would anchor off of \u20ac380 billion rather than \u20ac370 billion. So, the walk was from, call it, \u20ac420 billion, which was the earlier consensus number for the end of '25, which we said was pretty close. We took that down to \u20ac405 billion with the \u20ac15 billion, and now the \u20ac10 billion and the \u20ac15 billion improvement should get you to about \u20ac480 billion. That doesn't account for the redeployment. So, we'll see if that number still holds, there may be more opportunity to redeploy than we had originally anticipated, which is why, it's early days in the capital plan. In terms of fully phased in, I'll be honest, I haven't thought about it in the -- in just the two deposit books. And as I say, there's a lot of noise in the NII number. But in round numbers, we've -- on a reported basis, we've held steady at 13.5. Some of -- most of the NII upside that we saw this year actually went into the noninterest revenue lines. if I look to a normalized level, you'd like to see it, frankly, at 13.5 or better, especially going into '25 and beyond given, in the answer to Amit's question, the uplift that you get in both businesses from the deposit hedges moving. So, whatever the dip is next year, hopefully small, we think that we're sort of currently traveling at a baseline that's a pretty good baseline to grow from into '25 and '26. And that's before all of the noninterest revenue upside that we see and that Christian went through in his earlier comments. So that underscores, if you like, the optimism we have for the revenues next year and beyond. And we don't see any reason why the compound annual growth rate target would actually step back significantly from here over the next two years. So a 3.5 to 4.5 is something that you'd like to -- I say, I think we can achieve from this point or even better.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time.

        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Thank you, Silke, and a warm welcome also from my side. It's a pleasure to be discussing our third quarter and nine-month results with you today. These results show our continued progress on the path to our targets in several respects. First and foremost, we continue to demonstrate strong earnings momentum. We generated profit before tax of \u20ac5 billion in the first nine months, after absorbing nearly \u20ac950 million in non-operating costs including restructuring related to operational efficiencies. Our post-tax RoTE was 7% and would have been nearly 9% excluding these non-operating costs and with bank levies apportioned equally across the year. This reflects progress on our path to meet our 2025 target of above 10%. Second, we are seeing progress across all three dimensions of accelerated execution of our Global Hausbank strategy, namely revenue growth, operational efficiency, and capital efficiency. Strong operating performance is driven by business momentum through a well-balanced business model. Revenues in the first nine months were \u20ac22.2 billion, up 6% year-on-year, well above our target growth rate. Private Bank and Asset Management together attracted net inflows of \u20ac39 billion alongside \u20ac18 billion of deposit growth at the Group level in the third quarter. We also continue to make progress on the second dimension of our Global Hausbank strategy, operational efficiency. We have progressed with existing measures and we have additional measures in flight. And in terms of capital, we are delivering on our distribution commitments. We are on track to complete the \u20ac450 million share repurchase announced in July, thereby delivering total distributions across 2022 and 2023 of \u20ac1.75 billion. We finished the third quarter with strong capital. Our CET1 ratio was 13.9%. In addition, we have identified further capital opportunities and we now see scope to free up additional capital of \u20ac3 billion, enabling us to accelerate our strategy and boost returns, above our original expectations, from now to 2025 and beyond. This gives us added potential to increase capital distributions to shareholders while also deploying capital to support clients. Before we move on to progress in our businesses, let me give you an update on the Postbank IT migration. This was one of the largest IT migration projects in European banking and is essential to lay the foundations for a more digital bank offering at Postbank. We successfully migrated 50 billion records of 12 million Postbank customers; however, we saw unexpected levels of client enquiries which led to backlogs. We have put measures in place to work through these backlogs. This not only includes an increase of temporary staff, but also accelerating measures already underway such as implementation of automation and process optimization tools. And I am pleased that we have reduced the operational backlog by about two-thirds over the past weeks, and we expect 70% of all impacted Postbank customer processes to run against service level commitments again by end of October, including processes which have been particularly critical for our clients. We are confident that the remainder will be completed in the fourth quarter. Let me now turn to the key highlights of our resilient performance over the nine months on Slide 2. We delivered operating leverage of 4% on an adjusted basis in the first nine months, with revenues up 6% and adjusted costs up 2%. As a result, our pre-provision profit for the first nine months was up 5% year-on-year to \u20ac6 billion. In addition, we continue to reap the benefits of disciplined risk management and a high-quality loan book; provision for credit losses for the first nine months remained in line with our full year guidance at 28 basis points of average loans. Our balance sheet proved its resilience. Deposits rebounded by \u20ac18 billion to \u20ac611 billion in the third quarter. We saw franchise momentum across the board. And furthermore, we strengthened our capital position. Our CET1 ratio rose to 13.9% during the quarter, thanks, primarily, to strong organic capital generation from earnings and the results of our capital optimization efforts. This more than offset negative regulatory impacts, mostly model changes, and deductions for dividends and share buybacks. Let me now discuss the growth and balance across our business on Slide 3. The Corporate Bank delivered a post-tax RoTE of 17% in the past nine months. Strong revenue growth, combined with flat adjusted costs driven by tight expense discipline, produced operating leverage of 24%. Our momentum with key clients is encouraging; we saw an increase of around 40% in incremental deals won with multinational corporate clients which will drive future revenues. Our client focus, strong core capabilities and standing as an innovative thought leader in the market have been evidenced by The Banker's Transaction Banking Awards 2023, where Deutsche Bank has been voted Best Bank for Cash Management as well as Transaction Bank of the Year for Western Europe for the second consecutive year. In the Investment Bank, we have a well-diversified business portfolio, supported by our leading Financing business, which contributed \u20ac2.2 billion or approximately 35% of FIC revenues, year-to-date. We have invested into our Origination & Advisory business, taking advantage of market opportunities which are expected to drive future revenues, including through the acquisition of Numis, which we recently completed. We are also seeing clear signs of recovery in the market, led by Debt Origination. Turning to the Private Bank, the business grew revenues attracted inflows of \u20ac22 billion, supported by new money campaigns, and made further progress in streamlining our distribution channels. And finally, we also grew volumes in Asset Management. Assets under management grew by \u20ac38 billion, including \u20ac17 billion of net inflows in the first nine months of 2023, driven by strong inflows into Passive, including Xtrackers. The business launched 18 new products in the third quarter alone, including our first thematic ETFs in the U.S. market. To sum up, we delivered revenues of \u20ac28.5 billion in the last 12 months to September 30th, up over 6% versus the equivalent prior period. We also see forward momentum from net inflows, investments, and business wins with key clients. Our businesses are strongly complementary and well balanced. All of this supports our conviction that we will continue to grow our franchise and exceed our revenue growth targets. Now let me turn to the progress we\u2019re making to accelerate the execution of our Global Hausbank strategy on Slide 4. First, on revenues, with compound annual revenue growth of 6.9% over 2021, we are well on track to outperform on our revenue growth target of 3.5% to 4.5%. And we will continue to benefit from the higher rate environment which drives sustainable performance in the Private Bank and Corporate Bank. We also made progress with our own initiatives that are expected to drive fee income. We are confident that the new addition to the family, Deutsche Numis, will enable us to take added advantage of an expected pickup in corporate finance activity. With \u20ac39 billion of net asset inflows in nine months, we expect the growth of our assets under management to drive fee income in future quarters. Second, on operational efficiencies, our existing savings measures are largely proceeding in line with or ahead of plan. This includes streamlining of front-to-back processes and headcount management. We are also optimizing our distribution network and we have reduced branches by more than 90 over the first nine months of 2023. And this enabled us to keep our adjusted costs essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter, despite absorbing inflationary pressures and investments in growth and controls, and we continue to work on further measures. And third, turning to capital efficiencies, as I mentioned earlier, we have made considerable progress on several fronts. We have already delivered, after two quarters around \u20ac10 billion of the \u20ac15 billion to \u20ac20 billion RWA reduction we planned by the end of 2025. Other measures are already ongoing, mainly focused on hedging and reductions in sub-hurdle lending. And, given progress to date, we have identified additional opportunities to reduce RWAs further, and this enables us to raise our target by \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion. Let\u2019s now discuss what this means for us on Slide 5. As just mentioned, we will deliver a further RWA reduction of around \u20ac10 billion from our capital optimization measures. And on top of this, we now anticipate a lower impact from Basel III, by \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac15 billion, which James will discuss in a moment. Taken together, these two factors give us potential to free up additional capital of around \u20ac3 billion through 2025. We believe that our enhanced capital outlook will support accelerated and expanded distributions to shareholders while increasing our ability to invest in our platforms to boost growth and profitability. We will deliver this by sharpening our business model around capital-light and at-scale businesses, while applying rigorous hurdle rates to our portfolios to drive returns. As we look to 2025 and beyond, we see a clear opportunity to shift gears through a self-reinforcing process of franchise growth, operating leverage, and increased returns, and to create more lasting value for our shareholders as our Global Hausbank grows. With that, let me hand over to James"

        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Thank you, Christian. Let me start with a few key performance indicators on Slide 8 and place them in the context of our 2025 targets. Christian outlined the business momentum and our well-balanced revenue mix, which resulted in revenue growth of nearly 7% on a compound basis for the last twelve months relative to 2021. This performance puts us well on track to deliver revenue growth above our 2025 target. Our strong revenue growth combined with cost management led to a 2-percentage point improvement in the cost income ratio to 73% and our return on tangible equity was 7% in the first nine months of 2023. These ratios would have improved by almost 5% and 1.8 percentage points if adjusted for higher non-operating costs and if bank levies were apportioned equally across the year. Our capital position remained strong with the CET1 ratio at 13.9% this quarter after absorbing regulatory headwinds and the impact of the share repurchase. Our liquidity metrics also remained strong. LCR was 132%, in line with our target of around 130%, and the net stable funding ratio was 121%. In short, our performance in the period reaffirms our resilience and our confidence in reaching or exceeding our 2025 targets. With that, let me turn to the third-quarter highlights on Slide 8. Group revenues were \u20ac7.1 billion, up 3% on the third quarter of 2022 or 6% excluding specific items. Non-interest expenses were \u20ac5.2 billion, up 4% year on year, mainly driven by higher non-operating expenses. Non-operating expenses this quarter included litigation charges of \u20ac105 million and \u20ac94 million of restructuring and severance provisions. Adjusted costs increased 2% year-on-year, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac245 million or 20 basis points of average loans. We generated a profit before tax of \u20ac1.7 billion, up 7% year-on-year. Net profit of \u20ac1.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year reflecting an effective tax rate of 30% compared to 23% in the prior year quarter. Our cost income ratio was 72.4% and our post-tax return on average tangible shareholders' equity was 7.3% in the quarter. Diluted earnings per share was $0.56 in the third quarter and tangible book value per share was \u20ac27 and $0.74, up 5% year-on-year. Let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results, starting with interest revenues on Slide 9, average interest earning assets increased by \u20ac6 billion quarter-on-quarter, driven by the increase in our deposit levels, led by the Corporate Bank. Net interest margin in the Corporate Bank declined by approximately 25 basis points due lower lending income and a higher cost of liquidity reserves; however, net interest income on the corporate deposit books remained stable over the quarter. Net interest margin in the Private Bank remained broadly stable in the third quarter. Overall, our deposit betas continue to outperform our models. At the Group level NIM is down 12 basis points of which approximately 5 basis points relates to an accounting impact in C&O, similar to the first quarter, and the balance relates to the NIM reduction in the Corporate Bank. With that, let\u2019s turn to adjusted costs, on Slide 10. Adjusted costs excluding bank levies were \u20ac4.96 billion, in line with the prior quarter and up 2% year-on-year. The increase is driven by inflationary pressures, ongoing investments in controls and business growth which were partially offset by active cost management measures. All cost categories except for other costs were broadly flat to the prior year quarter. The variance in other non-compensation costs includes the non-recurrence of benefits in the prior year quarter, which related to deposit protection cost as well as movements in operational taxes. In addition, we see a normalization of marketing spend and we continue to invest into talent. Let\u2019s now turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 11. Provision for credit losses in the third quarter was \u20ac245 million, equivalent to 20 basis points of average loans. The decline compared to the previous quarter reflected a reversal of approximately \u20ac100 million of Stage 1 and 2 provisions driven by model changes and improved macroeconomic forecasts, mainly impacting the Investment Bank and Corporate Bank. Stage 3 provisions of \u20ac346 million were broadly in line with the previous quarter. Provisions this quarter were driven by the Private Bank and Investment Bank, while the Corporate Bank benefited from a lower level of impairments. For the full year, we continue to expect provisions to land at the upper end of our guidance range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans. Before we move on the next two slides starting with Slide 12. Our third quarter Common Equity Tier 1 ratio came in at 13.9%, a 19 basis point increase compared to the previous quarter. Regulatory changes, principally from the go-live of now-approved wholesale and retail models, resulted in a decline of 38 basis points, slightly below the low end of our previous guidance. Optimization initiatives generated 27 basis points from lower Credit Risk RWA, principally reflecting improvements in our data and certain process changes. Further 19 basis points of ratio support came from diligent risk management in our businesses. Finally, 11 basis point increase came from strong organic capital generation, that is net income, offset by deductions for the share buy-back, dividends and AT1 coupons. Building on Christian\u2019s earlier comments, let me give updated guidance on our capital outlook on Slide 13. As mentioned, regulatory changes led to a reduction of 38 basis points in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. With the go-live of the now-approved wholesale and retail models, the ECB has completed the review of approximately 85% of the relevant portfolio, and we expect only a limited ratio impact from the remainder. Next, we announced in the first quarter of this year a targeted \u20ac15 billion to \u20ac20 billion RWA reduction by end of 2025 through several capital optimization initiatives. We accelerated some of the anticipated data and process optimization initiatives into the third quarter which brings the cumulative RWA reductions to \u20ac10 billion to-date. The work we have done over the past several months gives us the confidence to increase the original target by \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion. Lastly, let me touch on our Basel III estimates, the latest review of our impact assessments indicates an RWA increase of only around \u20ac15 billion compared to the \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion, we have previously guided. The majority of the improvement comes from our Market Risk and Credit Valuation Adjustment, FRTB program, the impact estimates for which matured significantly. Credit Risk estimates are still under review and remain dependent on final CRR3 legislative text. Overall, let me highlight that current estimates are based on our interpretation of current draft regulation and therefore remain subject to change. Cumulatively, these changes in our outlook are significant and support Christian's earlier statements relating to our enhanced ability to execute our strategy and improve our return profile. Let's now turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 15. Corporate Bank revenues in the third quarter were \u20ac1.9 billion, 21% higher year-on-year driven by an improved interest rate environment and pricing discipline with double-digit growth across all client segments. Sequentially, revenues decreased slightly due to lower net interest income from lending and a higher cost of liquidity reserves. However, pricing discipline in our deposit businesses remained exceptionally strong, with limited pass-through and higher business volumes, resulting in strong deposit income. We continue to anticipate a normalization of our deposit revenues over the coming quarters which we expect to be partially offset by growing non-interest-rate-sensitive revenue streams, including commissions and fees. Loan volume in the Corporate Bank was \u20ac117 billion, down by \u20ac12 billion compared to the prior year quarter, but \u20ac1 billion higher compared to the low point in the prior quarter. Deposits were \u20ac286 billion, \u20ac15 billion higher than in the second quarter, with growth in both overnight and term balances in Euro and U.S. dollar and essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter, despite the market events in March. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac11 million or 4 basis points of average loans. The decrease compared to the prior quarter reflects a lower number of impairments in the third quarter and further benefits from Stage 3 recoveries as well as model changes impacting Stage 1 and 2 performing loans. Non-interest expenses were \u20ac1.1 billion, a decrease of 2% year on year driven by FX movements. Sequentially, expenses decreased by 7%, predominantly driven by the non-repetition of litigation charges. Profit before tax was \u20ac805 million in the quarter, doubling year-on-year and driving the post-tax return on tangible equity to 18.3%, with the cost income ratio at 57%. I'll now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 16. Revenues for the third quarter were essentially flat excluding the impact of DVA and 4% lower year-on-year on a reported basis. FIC Sales & Trading decreased by 12% against what was a strong prior year quarter. Rates, Foreign Exchange and Emerging Markets revenues were all lower compared to a very strong prior year quarter and reflected a less volatile market environment. Financing revenues remained strong on an absolute basis, though down year-on-year, due to the non-repeat of a material episodic item in the prior year quarter. Credit Trading revenues were significantly higher driven by ongoing improvements in the flow business and continued strong performance in Distressed. Moving to Origination & Advisory, revenues were up over three-fold, materially driven by the non-recurrence of leveraged lending markdowns in the prior year. However, excluding these markdowns, Origination & Advisory performance was still significantly higher and outperformed the industry fee pool. Debt Origination revenues were significantly higher benefitting from the non-repeat of the aforementioned markdowns and improved LDCM performance, which saw a partial recovery in both the industry fee pool and our market share versus the prior year. Advisory revenues were significantly lower reflecting a decline in the industry fee pool. However, as previously stated, with signs that deal activity is starting to recover, we expect our investments in Origination & Advisory to result in a significant improvement in performance into 2024. Non-interest expenses and adjusted costs were both essentially flat year-on-year. Risk-weighted assets were broadly stable year-on-year. Leverage decreased year-on-year driven by the impact of foreign exchange movements. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac63 million, or 25 basis points of average loans. The decrease versus the prior year was primarily driven by model changes affecting Stage 1 and 2 performing loans, partially offsetting Stage 3 impairments from Commercial Real Estate. Turning to the Private Bank on Slide 17. Revenues were up 3% year-on-year or 9% if adjusted for specific items in the prior year period which related to Sal. Oppenheim workout activities. Net interest income was essentially flat quarter-on-quarter, and higher deposit revenues in the third quarter were mainly offset by higher mortgage hedging costs following the Postbank transition, which were held centrally before. In the Private Bank Germany, revenues increased by 16% due to higher deposit revenues. A decline in fee income mainly reflected changes in contractual conditions impacting insurance products. Reported revenues in the International Private Bank were down 13% or up 2% year-on-year if adjusted for the non-recurrence of both specific revenue items in the prior year quarter and revenues from the divested Financial Advisory business in Italy, as well as FX impacts. Growth was driven by deposit products in Europe which were in part offset by continued client deleveraging in Asia. Revenues in Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs declined by 21% or 3%, if adjusted for the aforementioned effects. Revenues in Premium Banking increased by 14%, supported by higher interest rates. Turning to costs. The increase of noninterest expenses mainly reflects continued higher internal service cost allocations including investments in controls as well as restructuring provisions and severance related to strategy execution. The prior year period included a benefit from deposit protection costs. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac174 million or 27 basis points of average loans in the quarter and included an impact of approximately \u20ac25 million driven by the temporary operational backlog at Postbank. Overall, credit quality remained stable across our portfolios. The Private Bank attracted net inflows of \u20ac9 billion in the quarter with \u20ac6 billion in AUM deposits and \u20ac3 billion in investment products. Let me continue with Asset Management on Slide 18. My usual reminder, the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Assets under management remained stable at \u20ac860 billion in the quarter, supported by net inflows and positive FX effects, largely offset by \u20ac13 billion of market depreciation. Net inflows were primarily in Passive, continuing the momentum in our Xtrackers products we have seen throughout the year. As you will have seen in their results, DWS saw a decline in revenues compared to the prior year; however, with slightly lower non-interest expenses, profit before tax was essentially flat. This development principally reflected a 6% decline in management fees to \u20ac589 million due to prior year declines in assets under management, driven by net outflows excluding cash and market developments in 2022, as well as FX movements. Performance fees declined by \u20ac19 million. Other revenues declined due to lower mark-to-market valuations of co-investments, partly offset by favorable outcome of deferred compensation hedges. Non-interest expenses and adjusted costs were both 8% lower than the prior year. Compensation costs were lower driven by a significant decline in carried interest expense, partially due to lower performance fees in the period. Non-compensation costs were also lower, reflecting effective cost reductions across almost all cost categories. Profit before tax of \u20ac109 million in the quarter was down 18% compared to the prior year reflecting revenue performance. The cost income ratio for the quarter was 75% and return on tangible equity was 13%. Moving to Corporate & Other on Slide 19. Corporate & Other reported a pre-tax loss of \u20ac195 million this quarter versus a pre-tax loss of \u20ac28 million in the third quarter of 2022. This year-on-year change was driven in part by valuation and timing differences, which were positive \u20ac158 million in this quarter, versus \u20ac199 million the prior year quarter. The V&T result in this quarter was driven in particular by the reversal of prior period losses. Expenses associated with shareholder activities were \u20ac170 million in the quarter, compared to \u20ac144 million in the prior year quarter. And, the pre-tax loss associated with legacy portfolios was negative \u20ac137 million, driven primarily by litigation charges. Turning to the Group outlook for the full year on Slide 20. We remain focused on delivering positive operating leverage, as we drive our revenue growth initiatives and execute our cost reduction measures. We now expect full year 2023 revenues to be around \u20ac29 billion. Our noninterest expenses will be slightly higher reflecting a series of non-operating items; however, we expect our adjusted costs to remain essentially flat, in line with our guidance. Provision for credit losses is expected at the upper end of the 25 to 30 basis points range of average loans for the full year. Thinking ahead, our fourth quarter earnings are expected to be impacted by a number of one-off items, both positive and negative, including an accounting impairment of the goodwill from the Numis acquisition, a potential restitution payment from a national resolution fund, further restructuring and severance, as well as year-end tax adjustments. And finally, as both Christian and I have mentioned earlier, our capital outlook is substantially improved by further RWA reductions we have identified and we plan to engage with supervisors on the scope for further additional distributions to shareholders. With that, let me hand back to Silke and we look forward to your questions."

And also do you have any chance regarding your output for guidance? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Well, good morning, and thank you, Nico, for your question. Let me take the first part and then I hand over to James. Look, let me start that this is a very important and I think very good day for Deutsche Bank, because I think what we show now also on the capital side is nothing else than further evidence that our long-term strategy and obviously, the diligent execution around it is paying off more and more and obviously more to come. To your capital distribution question and how we did arrive, yes, it's a good day for shareholders, with material progress on our capital measures and scope to freeing up additional capital of the mentioned \u20ac3 billion from now through 2025. And as both James and I said in our prepared remarks, we see the outlook improvements regarding capital efficiency and Basel IV is providing us with the opportunity to both accelerate and expand our distribution right path. Amongst other things, it gives us the confidence to go beyond our earlier expectations In terms of buyback potential already next year. The better than expected third quarter RWA optimization and the improved outlook are both relatively recent changes and hence and hope you understand that it is a bit too early to provide exact details of how and when, we will be in a position to accelerate exactly this distribution path. And Nico, as you would expect, we are obviously in discussions with our supervisor on the revised capital plan. As we have laid down though a very clear path for dividends, i.e., a 50% increase per year the next two years. Extra distributions would come in form of share buybacks and subject to further dialogue with our supervisors. We would expect a significant proportion of the incremental capital to be distributed to our shareholders. And for instance, one way to think about this trajectory, Nico, from here is that it gives us the opportunity to move to a 50% payout ratio sooner than we initially expected. So I think at this point, we can safely say that shareholder distributions is a key priority for Deutsche Bank and for more details, I hand over to James."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Sure. Thank you, Christian, and Nicolas, thank you for the question. So to give you a little bit of color on what is the optimization been that we've accomplished so far. You've seen us do three securitizations over the past couple of quarters including one on the Italian consumer portfolio in this quarter, and so that's been sort of quicker and more effective than we might have expected. And then when we talk about data and process improvements, the data is quite powerful, and by the way, this is where also we're getting the Postbank portfolio onto the same systems as DB is helpful, because we're able to apply, for example, SME support factors, infra support factors on the portfolio, in a way that we couldn't in the prior landscape. So it's enhancing the data, enhancing the way that our portfolio, if you like interacts with the rules. We think there's still a distance to go with that. And although we've worked on it for years, as rules change, one always finds additional optimization measures, so that's been very encouraging. If I think about, your question about input, output put floors on Basel III, we've really been focused on the 1125 impact and, as you've seen, dramatic improvement based on better visibility into the FRTB models as we mentioned. At this point, the output floor is still some years away, so I think of that as biting maybe in 2030. If you want guidance, we would probably stick with the 30 billion impact, at that point, but to be fair, we haven't really done this next round of mitigation in terms of portfolio shifts and what have you, so that's still a long way out. Hopefully, that helps, Nicolas, on your questions."

I appreciate you don't want to front run exactly, what we're going to look, what this is going to look like in the short-term, but you're on the tape this morning discussing higher payout next year than in your original planning. Can you confirm that that original plan was the plus 50% on the buyback to match the dividend increase? And can you also discuss whether we can look at more regular capital return over the next few years rather than having to wait for full year results each year? Secondly, on revenues, NII clearly stepped back in corporate bank, Private Bank this quarter. That's kind of been guided to, but can you give us some more color about the shape from here and use that to reference your confidence in revenue growth for the group into 2024?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Look, let me start on briefly again on the capital question. And again, I think it's good order to discuss all the details with our regulator first. But I think you're right, the 50% dividend pass, we always said, and we also said that this is quite a good guidance for our past guidance on the share buybacks. So in this regard, I think you have a good assumption. And as I just said, I think with the scope now of the additional 3 billion. Obviously, we would like and we intend then to start increasing the share buyback already in 2024, beyond that what we already communicated in our previous correspondence. So clearly an acceleration and expansion that's our goal and that will focus now -- this is our focus in our discussions with the regulators going forward. With regard to the revenues, I will hand over to James for more details in particular when it comes to NII. But also here I think very good messages because the clear jump off point for 2024 is now the 29 billion in 2023. You have seen a good development in the third quarter. Again, a very stable development also by the way on the NII side in both Corporate Bank and Private Bank, We see that momentum going forward into Q4 and therefore there is a high confidence in delivering 29 billion number for the full year 2023. On top of that, and I think we refer to that in our previous calls already. The geopolitical environment, the economic environment is something where at the end of the day, the advice which is asked by the clients, on the private banking side, on the corporate banking side, also with regard to our investment banking services is increasing and increasing. And therefore, we also said in our prepared remarks a 40% increase in mandated deals from the corporates in these first nine months of 2023 versus the same time period of 2022 is just one signal how much we are actually and see the momentum with our corporate clients around the world to think about how to best position in these geopolitical situations where we are. And hence, in particular also the investments which we are doing on the corporate side, in the investment banking on the advisory side, the investments which we have done on the wealth management side, now the finalization of the Numis transaction will grow also the non-NII business in 2024 a lot. And therefore, seeing the stability actually also in the NII business in 2023 plus the growth we see from the advisory, our clear goal is to show a 2024 revenue number of 30 billion. Regarding the composition, James will outline further but we can see a momentum which is simply unbroken."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "So, Adam couple of things on your comments, well let me start with the comment that our group NII number is a very noisy line and we've talked about it before the impact of the FX swap book and therefore the rate differential between euros and dollars plays a role here as does hedging results and other parts of the treasury piece, which is why it's actually I think more instructive to look at the net interest income and the margins of the businesses especially PB and CB. Now, there we show you margins that were actually reasonably stable quarter-on-quarter, some pressure in PB and CB rather. But interestingly this quarter the principal drivers were not the deposit margins. There was again noisy even at that level around mortgage hedging for example in the private bank, you know the excess of deposits over loans impacting the margin in the Corporate Bank, so things outside of the deposit margins. That difference was about 130 million if you take the two businesses together. We think Q4 will be about the same level, so flat to that. Really as deposit margins come in a little bit, but some of this other noise kind of clears through the system. So as Christian says, we feel good about the trajectory looking forward one even two quarters in those two businesses. And that of support, of course, supports our view going into to 2024. I think the other thing just briefly you mentioned on the timing of the buyback and distribution announcements, it's a fair point. It would take a lot of pressure off of us and the supervisors to do this more frequently and let's see is the short version. We want to -- the nice thing is if you split it out over the year, you can be a little bit more dynamic to the market environment and conditions. On the other hand, I think to some degree shareholders have sought the greatest degree of confidence as early as possible. So we're going to need to balance those two things but I could certainly envisage multiple requests in the year going forward."

Could you give us a sense of the size of the inflation headwinds you were able to offset and underlying costs in the quarter and maybe also where you'd expect to end the year given the Q4 one offs you flagged and how that sets the business up heading into 2024? And then secondly, maybe looking a bit further out to 2025, obviously, the revenue momentum is working out in your favor as you just discussed, but there's also still a disconnect between your targets on cost to income ratio and return on tangible equity for 2025 and the latest consensus. So just what are the main moving parts over the next two years that give you confidence on reiterating those 2025 targets?"

        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Yes. Potentially, I start on your second part and obviously James shall add. Look on the difference in the 2025 targets I think it comes from both sides. Number one, a further increasing revenue line James just outlined, the 2024 pass, our confidence in the 30 billion in 2024. And obviously, we see that momentum also going then into the next year in 2025. And in particular in 2025 as we always said before, we have another NII tailwind actually in the private bank, which is not to be underestimated. So therefore, on the revenue side, Chris, further growth to be seen clearly. On the cost side, I'm really confident, because you know that we have given the goal of 2.5 billion, 2 billion already with our IDD in 2022. These 2 billion is actually based on our so-called key deliverables, i.e., the Germany optimization, the front to back, the technology architecture, the infrastructure efficiencies, real estate savings and so on. And there we really have a high confidence to deliver these 2 billion based on all the structural work which we have done over the last the 18 months since the IDD and we can see progress every quarter. On the remaining 500 million, obviously we are working diligently but also there good progress. We discussed with you the reduction in force program in April. We have actioned on that. We have 900 reduction delivering more than 100 million of annualized savings now from now on starting. James said it this morning rightly so. We have additional measures, which are now in execution and in flight that we further reduce our workforce. By the way, also with regard to the overall remediation which we have seen over the last years, we can see now that we think we have seen the peak in our workforce and we will further reduce. And this, if you want to mention it reduction in force 2.0 will be from a size and number bigger than the reduction we have seen in April 1.0. So that is the next part. And in line with our goal of achieving these additional 500 million, obviously, we are doing other things like third-party spending whether it's consulting marketing spending, which will save us a meaningful number also in 2024 versus 2023. We are obviously also with the peak in workforce which we have seen. We are obviously very selective and cautious also when it comes to new hirings. And in this regard, we have very good side on the 2.5 billion. That with the growing revenue number, which I just outlined. We are in full confidence that we can achieve the 10% or what we always wanted to do and where we still stand by to actually exceed the 10% RoTE in 2025."

        "text": "So Chris just on your inflation question and perhaps a little bit more on the targets. So inflation, it depends very much on what you're looking at. Compensation costs, elements of non-compensation for example software, there can be quite varied impacts. But I would say we're facing across the world, probably 4% to 5% inflation on average in both comp and non-comp costs that we need to work to offset. So far, I think we've been quite successful, in both line items. You need to work very hard on workforce composition. As Christian outlined, we've got a lot of measures underway there whether it's internalization, location strategy or just managing with discipline across the Company. And then on the non-comp, you've really got to focus on demand. And that's where I think that, passing some of the what I'll call the inflection points that we've been passing whether that's you know technology implementations, whether that's, control investment remediation, it does give us more flexibility to manage the demand side there. And so that gives us some comfort. If I think to run rates which I think was embedded in the second part of your question. We've talked over the course of the year about run rates, maybe made it too complex for you, but we're trying to manage in that 4.95 billion to let's say, 5 billion per quarter in adjusted cost range. We've had some pressure this year not just in inflation which I think we've been successful offsetting but also some of the investments that we've been making. In the fourth quarter, we may have some additional sort of unexpected costs associated with Postbank remediation that may push us up closer to or perhaps slightly above the 5 billion level in Q4 with all of that baked in including the additional Numis costs. I think we've talked about 4.975 billion back in July. But overall, a continued sort of evidence of I think discipline and control across the Company. That would represent a good step off also into 2024, whereas you know the goal that we have and Christian just outlined is to continue to crystallize these cost savings measures in order to manage overall flat notwithstanding inflation and investments."

I think you just mentioned it and revenues near-term, and is there also risk as in, it could potentially delay, the target of cost savings? And if you can please talk about, I mean, if you can, about what we might expect in terms of potential actions by, BaFin could it be like fines operational risks or similar? And then secondly on the NII or the headwinds to your revenues in the Corporate Bank, the higher funding costs. Should we expect you increase the deposit collection further in Q4 and expect further headwinds? And is this related to, TLTRO maturities? I mean, I guess it offsets the benefit of the higher rates, so how much more of a headwind should we see there?"

        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "I'll try to be brief. Look, we don't see a revenue impact of the Postbank integration or operational backlog issues and we wouldn't necessarily expect one going forward. Obviously, we want to work hard to put these issues behind us and sort of pivot to a very different customer experience and that's the focus of the management team there. You've seen, a cost of provisioning cost impact in Q3 that could also extend into Q4, but ultimately, we would expect to get that back as really we get back on track in terms of the collections activity where there's been some diversion of the operational staff. So call it zero or close to zero in those two lines when all is said done. On expenses, it's probably been in the high-single-digits in Q3, in terms of the remediation costs and if you kind of look to that in Q4, somewhere between 30 million to 35 million of incremental spend on the remediation, but we would expect that to tail off relatively quickly in 2024 as we put the operational issues behind us. And frankly invest in automation and improved capabilities going forward, so we feel it'll be a temporary impact. As it relates to sort of crystallizing the long-term benefits of the unity project, no change there, we're at work in app decommissioning and the various elements of the project that, particularly on the technology side, we're going to drive, the benefits, too early to make any comments on fines, frankly. We're working very closely with the BaFin, collaboratively with them and the monitor, and I think our interests are very well aligned that we want to put the backlog behind us and cease any disruption to our clients. On the liquidity and funding costs, it's interesting. I mentioned earlier that it's this excess of liabilities over assets in the corporate bank that can sometimes be a drag. The interesting sort of corollary there is we haven't yet seen a benefit in the NIM of loan growth. And so for the Corporate Bank in particular and then at the group level, we would benefit from putting the deposits to use. We're looking forward and believe that we should start to get some momentum in terms of loan growth going forward, and hence that imbalance can begin to help us. As it relates to TLTRO, you've seen that you've prefunded some of the maturities, the December maturities, and so TLTRO is becoming a less and less impactful, sort of part of our overall balance sheet and funding profile. Yes, there's a little bit of a drag going into 24% coming in that, but that, at this point is in sort of low very low double digits per quarter in the coming several quarters."

We increased in particular the German private banking business by 16%. And I think this is another evidence actually that from a revenue point of view, it is so far not affecting us and I also don't expect that. And I have to say what the people in the private bank are doing in Germany is a fantastic job. Actually, A, to make sure that we reduce the backlog and we are doing really good progress, and secondly, actually take care of our clients.

        "text": "Good morning and thank you for your presentation. I have two questions please. The first one, I want to go back to the 3 billion potential additional capital freed up in the next two years as a result of Basel IV and an RWA reduction. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense to what extent do you expect actually to deploy some of that additional capital into the business organically or perhaps inorganically? And if so, what are the areas where you see perhaps and clear opportunities for that redeployment, and mindful that you mentioned that significant proportion is obviously for distribution? So that's the first question. And the second question is on the Corporate Bank. And I just wanted to pick up on the comment from you James on so far you haven't put those additional deposits into work. Yet we're seeing a very small uptick in loans in the corporate bank. So, the combination of the two suggests perhaps you have somewhat of a better outlook in terms of deployment and new lending, if you could just share your thoughts on that? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Yes, Mate, thank you very much for the question, and it's a great question. We've spent some time looking at this actually, and I want to give you a little bit of sort of color looking at the last seven quarters of where the capital has gone. So on average, we've generated about 27 basis points of capital, each quarter over the last year and change, and this is what's interesting. About a third of that has gone to support the distributions that we've been making so far, the 1.75 billion. About a third has gone into the regulatory changes, and about a third has gone into the ratio improvement up to now close to 14%. Almost none has gone into the business so far, and one of the reasons we think this sort of inflection point is so important is, first of all, we think we can step up the profitability, so the 27 basis points doesn't, by any means, have to be the cap in terms of what we can generate. But I think there is scope to increase the business deployment beyond, where what we've been doing the past couple of years especially as that reg build falls away, and we're at a ratio level now that is entirely comfortable for us in terms of buffers. So, there is capacity both for business deployment and for significant, distribution increases. Now to your point about Corporate Bank, yes, revenue loan growth in the past year and change has been quite slow across both businesses. And we'd like to think that there's, again, some signs of life. You mentioned a small increase, about 1 billion in the quarter in loans in the Corporate Bank. We've been waiting for that to come. We'd like to see it, and we think we may see it already in the fourth quarter, but then extending into 2024. And with our loan to deposit ratio now again below 80%, we have the capacity to support loan growth both from a capital and from a funding perspective. So we do think, we're turning the corner in terms of the ability to redeploy in both of those senses. In private bank, perhaps a little bit more sluggish. As you know, we've made a decision, not to kind of, emphasize mortgage lending, in Germany both given the market environment and given capital requirements, but we think we have capacity to grow margin lending in wealth management as that comes back to grow unsecured consumer lending. So that may take a little bit longer to come back, but also in that business, there's potential to grow loans to redeploy capital. Lastly, and this came up in a recent conference, we are careful in how we manage the capital that's committed to the investment bank, so those are portfolios that while there is opportunity to grow within our risk appetite. We are careful to manage the capital to that business, devoted to that business within constraints that we set. And so while we think there are attractive lending, opportunities there, we're going to be cautious about growing especially in an environment where there is still some uncertainty in the in credit environment. So look, short version is real capacity now for deployment in the businesses while we're in a very different, environment in terms of distribution potential."

[Technical Difficulty] How do you think about the opportunities to invest that 3 billion of extra capital in growing the IB? On the one hand [Technical Difficulty] ex capital off your consensus 25 leverage ratio, I guess, just 4.6% suggest you have a lot of scope if you will [Technical Difficulty] that traffic. Please?"

        "text": "So, Stuart, it's James. You were cutting in and out a little bit, but I'll go with what I believe the questions were and you may need to follow-up. On RWA optimization, to be honest, so are we surprised, we've been, I'd like to think at the more sophisticated end of this type of balance sheet management over the years and to find more opportunity, is on the one hand encouraging, on the other hand you know suggest that there was something left on the table in the past. Now the securitization piece is a step change and what we're looking at and willing to do. But we've, as we've talked about before, we still like the economics of securitization. So we would estimate for example that the revenue to RWA relationship of the securitization we did this quarter was about 1.5% maybe 1.6% and so we can redeploy that capital at better, sort of equity margins call it than that. So there is still more to do. And as I mentioned earlier, you know, as the data environment improves more and more, we see scope to continue optimization. Of course, Basel III is entirely new, so the work on the models there, the visibility into the impact of hedging strategies that's also new. So it's a bit of an ongoing story. The redeployment I talked about a moment ago really to Mate's question. Again, there is scope to support growth in the businesses, but frankly the extra capital that we now have doesn't really change the growth potential of the businesses, and won't change our risk appetite. As you know, we've been disciplined about risk appetite. And we also intend to be different disciplined around capital allocation as I mentioned earlier, especially recognizing that that's a focus of attention around the investment bank. And finally, on the leverage balance sheet, we see them as sort of moving a little bit in tandem. So as our CET1 ratio goes up, so too is the leverage ratio. And while there's a bit more flexibility in managing the leverage balance sheet, we think we can very comfortably remain in the mid to high 4s, over time and if you like optimize the revenue footprint of that leverage balance sheet. So, hopefully, those answered your questions even though there was a little bit of signal challenge."

But I do not see us changing dramatically our strategies put it that way, in terms of leverage deployment. I would think that on a comparative basis, we've been on the more conservative end in terms of the deployment of our leveraged balance sheet. And I don't see that changing dramatically, Stuart, even in light of some of the changes that you're seeing in the U.S."

So I agree with James. I think for us, it is good, on the one hand, that there is more capacity, but the strict adherence to risk return and to our capital allocation in this regard will not change. We want to grow our profitability. Now we have a bit more capacity to do this and we will do this, but we will not leave our risk appetite nor our clear reward expectations we have from the businesses."

If we take this year, it looks like your FIC revenues could land around the 8 billion mark with consensus expecting something similar over the next couple of years. But this is 2.5 billion higher than what we saw in 2018 and '19, and I appreciate the rent environment is very different. There's been a bit of balance sheet growth there as well. So what makes you confident that the 8 billion is sustainable given a pretty well documented normalization of the wider industry? And then secondly, on government taxes, it's been a key theme for the sector over the last few months. And again, I appreciate the impacts on you. Will it be limited so far, but do you see any risk for Germany to follow suit?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Let me start. Look, what makes me confident on the fixed side that this kind of 2.5 billion higher than three or four years ago is something sustainable. It's 3, 4 points, but number one, the healing of the bank. I mean this is the most important if you talk to our institutional clients, but also to the corporate clients. And I cannot even tell you -- and that was our focus, the transformation, the healing and with that obviously the rating upgrades which we have received from all the major rating agencies. That resulted in a completely different way how we can deal with our clients and that a lot of clients actually return to Deutsche Bank. And to be honest, we are still in the documentations of clients who have returned after the last increase and improvement of the rating agencies because you know how long it takes to get the documentation is the agreements, right? And in this regard, I can still see the benefits from that. So the healing of the bank is one of the key reasons. Number two, I think it's the focus which we have given ourselves, and in particular, Ram has done in the FIC business, in the trading business. It was exactly right to focus on that, where we are strong from a regional point of view starting with Europe, then obviously going into our emerging markets franchise also covering Asia, but also investing very focused in the U.S. And Ram has a clear plan how to grow also our FIC business in the U.S. over the next 12 to 18 months, and he put the right investments into that. Number three, it's the front-to-end reengineering of our processes in FIC. Also that is obviously which is not only making us more efficient, but at the end of the day, front-to-end always results in one thing. This is client experience for our clients. And with that, obviously, we make ourselves more attractive to deal with us. So, I think it's the overall healing of the bank but also the real focus and reengineering of the platform Ram has done to the FIC business, which makes me comfortable that the \u20ac8 billion which we have seen so far is a very good number to actually plan for the future and, in my view, if I look at his plan to even increase from there. Nevertheless, always said, we even want to make the investment banking business more balanced and therefore the investments into the O&A businesses. And also in the prepared remarks, we said how stable actually within the FIC business the financing part is. It's 35% of the FIC business. And that is coming through year by year, I think, with a very good and solid underwriting scheme. Regarding government taxes, look, it's always hard for me to judge what is coming. But on this end in Germany, on this side in Germany, I'm very calm. We have clear statements that these kind of excess taxes, I think, is not supported, in particular not by our finance minister. There is really no active discussion on this one. And therefore, it is for me a non-topic."

        "text": "So firstly on capital, just one clarification here. It doesn't seem like you're prepared to increase the \u20ac8 billion overall capital return envelope, but it does seem that you're more confident on reaching that 50% payout sooner rather than later. Is that the best way to think about it? So that \u20ac3 billion capital, that's being released as it were. That doesn't really become additive to the \u20ac8 billion? And then with that, if you look at your actions to optimize capital and RWAs, I guess that reduces risk weight density. And is that the way you see it? And so that being the case, maybe your guidance on the output floor there. Your comments earlier are that we should maybe stick to the \u20ac30 billion RWA impact there. And just very lastly, on the Corporate Bank NII, it does seem like the largest impact there is from the increase in liquidity reserve costs. What's your expectation there for how that should develop going forward, please?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "So Andrew, the answer to the first question is no, that's not the correct way to think about it. So think about it this way. We had a capital commitment to shareholders of \u20ac8 billion at a point in time where our outlook and our step off were weaker than they are today. What we're not able or willing to say at this point is how much of that increment is going to come out to shareholders and how soon. We obviously owe you an answer on that in time, and we'll work through that internally in our capital planning and then with supervisors. But no, we would see it as incremental to the \u20ac8 billion. In terms of optimization, it's complex just because at a point in time, we're going to need to optimize around the output floor. That's not something that we've really done. Ironically, the impetus there would be to take on higher-risk density assets and so sort of optimize in that way. And actually, it goes a little bit also to Stuart's question. The -- what regulation asks you to do now is run this complex optimization algorithm across all of those resources in time. So, it's advanced approaches RWA, it will be standardized approaches RWA and then the leveraged balance sheet, And we're going to need to find the optimal use of the balance sheet under all three of those tests. In the case of the standardized, we have until 2030 when we think the out floor bites. I wouldn't expect -- just on the CB NII piece, I wouldn't expect that to change sequentially in the next couple of quarters. Again, a little bit depending on whether -- on how the loan and deposit sort of trajectory for the business go from here. We'd like to think we can continue to grow deposits and grow the loan balances, but it's the relationship between the two that really drives the question of the liquidity funding in the CB business."

If you have to, if you have to have the break, due to market conditions changing. Can you talk about the flexibility of cost? As you indicate, there's a lot of stickiness, there's inflation in cost, and I just try to understand your flexibility in that respect. How we should think about the elements of cost reduction in a different environment, and how you model that internally? And then secondly, the question is regarding your remarks on cost of risk. You mentioned model changes and improved macro forecast leading to reversals in Stage 1 and 2 provisions. Can you help me understand what's driving this more optimistic outlook, please?

        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Well, look, we've about this over the years, the P&L sensitivity, and I'd like to think. In fact, I'm confident that both sides of that equation have improved over the last several years. So start with the revenue side, as our revenue mix has shifted over time, I think our revenue sensitivity has declined dramatically, and not just because more of the revenues are coming from the businesses that we describe as more stable, but also because the revenue composition in the Investment Bank, I think has firmed up as well and our market position as Christian has outlined. So, I think that revenue sensitivity is lower than you might think, and by the way you also see us take relatively conservative decisions whether that's about risk type or on our interest rate risk management. So we manage that, it's not just an accident. And then on the cost side I have said over the years that that less is of the cost base is variable than I would like it to be. I think that equation is also changing for the better. Let's start with just the investment profile. As we shift from, I'll call them non-discretionary investments, investments that needed to be made in technology and in controls to a more discretionary profile, we can hit the brakes on those investments. And the other thing is that as we get deeper and deeper into the structural cost saves that Christian outlined, more of the cost base ends up being variable, and that can be variable compensation, but it can also be other elements of the cost base. So, the short version I think we're improving both aspects of that equation Kian relative to where we were a few years ago. On the cost of risk just in the detail there we had \u20ac100 million net on the Stage 1 and 2. Actually what that was a \u20ac100 million model benefit associated with the PD LGDs in the new wholesale and retail models plus about \u20ac30 million of FLI, forward looking indicator benefits, offset by about \u20ac30 million of in Stage 1 and 2 of portfolio changes, including sort of internal ratings and that sort of thing. Now why did the FLI improve? The point in time is always hard to remember, but the last time we booked this on a quarterly basis was in July where the outlook for the soft landing particularly in the U.S. was actually less optimistic than it became through the third quarter, so what you're seeing is a bit of a lag effect as to where things stood at that time."

Look, we're observing a very stable situation in terms of their credit worthiness. They benefit hugely from the resilience. I think I said it in one of the previous calls if I compare the situation of German Mittelstands clients with 15 years ago, we have a capital ratio, we have a liquidity ratio, liquidity position of those clients which is in much better shape than 15 years ago after the global financial crisis, they all worked on themselves. So, I think despite the no growth situation in Germany, we can really attest a very resilient portfolio. And hopefully with growth coming back in '24, albeit very low growth in '24, we then will also to see that there is obviously growth coming back into those slides. So for the time being also from our rating downgrades versus upgrades, no negative or no deterioration to that what we have seen three or six months ago."

So can you quantify and give us more confidence in your cost stability and managing your cost stability in a different scenario?"

First of all, I do believe that it's most important for our credibility that we achieve those cost targets which we have given to the market and we will do so. That's therefore, I ran you through the structural cost savings and that what we now put on top actually in order to get to the 2.5 billion. Secondly, of course, if this would happen, you have three or four layers, of course, where we can very quickly reduce the spending. That is the variable comp which means -- with regard to investments. Obviously, we are reviewing those investments on a quarterly basis. Also adhering, obviously, to the profile on the business side and whether the performance is the right one. I think we have a very good monitoring in place on this one. Secondly, yes, there is always the flexibility on the variable comp, which we obviously would adjust to the performance -- to the revenue performance. I think we have also shown that in the past that we are able to do this, and we will do this. So this is obviously, if you look at our variable comp, that is not an insignificant number, which we could reduce like for the CTB, i.e., change the bank investment. And then you have those items where Rebecca is going actively after already now but which also plays into this one, which is everything on third-party costs, which means also consultancy, which means marketing. And easily in this regard from a flexibility point of view, Kian, you are in a very high 3-digit million number. And in this regard, I would say this bank has clearly the ability to react. But most important for us is obviously to first of all deliver that what we promised to you and this is the \u20ac2.5 billion."

So this would be my question number one. And my second question is on the outlook on O&A. So again, a strong recovery here. So what's your view on the last quarter? Should we expect another pickup despite the seasonal patterns? And what are your expectations looking further down the road?"

So, we're optimistic there. On the Q4 one-offs, why don't I meet you halfway? On the DTA, I would expect and here it's a different geography from last year, where the DTA related to the U.S. I would size it today at about 5 million of opportunity in the tax line, potentially larger. It all depends on our forward-looking view of profitability in the UK entities and jurisdiction going forward. That's to the positive. The Numis goodwill, it's too early to give an exact number given we're going through the purchase price allocation process sort of as we speak. But to give you a ballpark, I would expect us to book about \u20ac250 million in -- as a non-operating cost around that Numis goodwill. The numbers that I can't really guide you on today would be, one, the restitution payment to the upside. And then as you all know, restructuring and severance and legal litigation items are always subject to some uncertainty. And so as we get more visibility, if we get an opportunity, we'll give you an update on that. I'd like to think the net of those four things is biased to the positive, but we have to wait and see how it all plays out."

If I compare your level of provisioning, especially on the U.S. side with what U.S. banks have been seeing so far this quarter, it seems like you have -- your provisions are lower. I was wondering what gives you the confidence of these passively lower provisions in these markets specifically, especially for U.S. office, which seems particularly challenged? And then on Numis, I know it's early days. The acquisition closed 13th of October, I believe. But I was wondering if you have any early thoughts that you would like to share now that this is part of Deutsche Bank. And then a quick technical one. DTAs, with all these DTAs being written back, what's the benefit for the tax rate in the coming years?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Thanks, Julia. So I'll try to -- well, starting with CRE, it's just hard to say because we have no insight into our competitors' portfolios. And so we can tell you what we think of ours. And as we've said sort of consistently from the start of this cycle, we think we have a high-quality portfolio. It's -- to the extent it's concentrated -- obviously, there's an office exposure, but it's concentrated in Class A strong sponsors and what have you. And what we -- but we're happy to share this time in the appendix material is, frankly, the experience that we've had. So now we're sort of four, five quarters into this cycle in commercial real estate. And we think that the relationship between the loan modifications and the expected credit losses that arise from that speak to the quality of the portfolio. Now that, we're, call it, halfway through that. But you can see that if trends continue or even deteriorate a little bit, this should be an entirely manageable situation for that. Coverage is hard to measure on a comparative basis. But we think we're taking provisions and collateral allowance and collateral together. We think we're sort of reasonably in line with the peers. On Numis, we're very excited about the transaction. I mean, the first few days and the process with the Deutsche Numis organization have been very successful. Both the Deutsche U.K. corporate finance team going into Numis and the relationship with the Numis leadership and staff is off to a great start, and the client feedback has been extremely positive ever since the announcement. So, it's early days in terms of revenue production, if you like, but we're very encouraged by what we see so far. Ultimately, on the DTA, it doesn't really affect the tax rate. So you should expect us to advise an effective tax rate continuing to be in the sort of 29% to 30% range, going forward, always a little bit of variation in that. But the DTAs are one-off. And I would think of it as complete, if you like, this year when we revalue the U.K. tax characteristics."

I'm just curious, I mean, I think unless you change the exit rate for this year, it's a bit higher than the level achieved this year or will be. So I mean, when should we expect to see those costs coming out? So would that be more in the second half of '24 or into '25? Or could it be sooner? And then secondly, just related to that, I mean, if costs proved to be a bit more sticky, are you seeing potential distribution of the RWA efficiency savings as the other or another lever to help get to that 10% RoTE target or above? Or are these kind of just two very independent things? And then just one follow-up, I guess you just mentioned, obviously, on PB, the revenue tailwind in 2025. I was just wondering if you can potentially size that or give us an indication of how much you're expecting from that."

        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Sure. Thanks, Amit. Look, actually, the middle part of your question is a really good one. The RWA and the RoTE are, in fact, linked. And ironically, you start to have denominator problem and, therefore, a strong incentive to distribute capital in order not to have the RoTE dragged down by higher tangible equity. In fact, you're seeing that already this year. The biggest part of the RoTE decline in the third quarter versus last year was just higher capital. The tax rate played a big impact as well. But leaving that aside, it's higher capital. So we are incentivized to push out capital. If I think about the exit rate, yes, the 5% is a little higher than we'd like it to be. And to your point, to get to a full year number of adjusted costs in line with this year, we would need to start bringing it down in the second half. But look, if we're traveling in the 4.9 to 5 area next year in each of the four quarters, we think we're doing okay. And we will -- to Kian's earlier question, we think we've got more levers to help to drive that going forward. On the tailwind into '25, this is some distance ahead, but I would quantify it as \u20ac200 million to \u20ac300 million just from the deposit hedges kind of rolling over, so a nice tailwind for that business, for the PB business going forward."

If I adjust that for the undershoot today, the extra savings, the Basel IV, it would come out more like \u20ac370 billion. Is that a fair expectation? Or is it likely to be higher than that with redeployment? So that's my first question. And then different numbers question on NII, you've talked a bit about deposit NII pressure in 4Q. If rates stay at this level and beta gets to its sort of medium-term resting place and also term assets re-price fully, what would we be subtracting and adding to NII? And I'm particularly focused on the Corporate Bank and the Private Bank. So just those two big numbers, if we fully did the beta and fully re-priced any term assets that take time, what would we be adding and subtracting?"

        "text": "So Jeremy, on the RWA, I would -- in brief, I would anchor off of \u20ac380 billion rather than \u20ac370 billion. So, the walk was from, call it, \u20ac420 billion, which was the earlier consensus number for the end of '25, which we said was pretty close. We took that down to \u20ac405 billion with the \u20ac15 billion, and now the \u20ac10 billion and the \u20ac15 billion improvement should get you to about \u20ac480 billion. That doesn't account for the redeployment. So, we'll see if that number still holds, there may be more opportunity to redeploy than we had originally anticipated, which is why, it's early days in the capital plan. In terms of fully phased in, I'll be honest, I haven't thought about it in the -- in just the two deposit books. And as I say, there's a lot of noise in the NII number. But in round numbers, we've -- on a reported basis, we've held steady at 13.5. Some of -- most of the NII upside that we saw this year actually went into the noninterest revenue lines. if I look to a normalized level, you'd like to see it, frankly, at 13.5 or better, especially going into '25 and beyond given, in the answer to Amit's question, the uplift that you get in both businesses from the deposit hedges moving. So, whatever the dip is next year, hopefully small, we think that we're sort of currently traveling at a baseline that's a pretty good baseline to grow from into '25 and '26. And that's before all of the noninterest revenue upside that we see and that Christian went through in his earlier comments. So that underscores, if you like, the optimism we have for the revenues next year and beyond. And we don't see any reason why the compound annual growth rate target would actually step back significantly from here over the next two years. So a 3.5 to 4.5 is something that you'd like to -- I say, I think we can achieve from this point or even better."

    "transcript": "Ioana Patriniche: Thank you for joining us for our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Preliminary Results Call. As usual, our Chief Executive Officer, Christian Sewing, will speak first; followed by our Chief Financial Officer, James von Moltke. The presentation, as always, is available to download in the Investor Relations section of our website, db.com. Before we get started, let me just remind you that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which may not develop as we currently expect. We therefore ask you to take notice of the precautionary warning at the end of our materials. With that, let me hand over to Christian.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, Ioana, and a warm welcome from me. It's a pleasure to be discussing our results with you today. We have set Deutsche Bank's course for sustainable growth and returns for shareholders through our Global Hausbank strategy and 2023 saw clear progress. We delivered business growth, as the benefits of our sharpened business model came through. We grew revenues to around \u20ac29 billion with a growth rate of close to 7% per year since 2021, well above our initial target, and we are now raising our revenue growth target to 5.5% to 6.5%, with the aim of reaching revenues of around \u20ac32 billion by 2025. We made conscious investment decisions to protect and grow our franchise by driving business growth, strengthening controls and improving operational efficiency.We have now reached an inflection point on costs; our investments are approaching completion, and we are making solid progress on our efficiency program. As a result, we now see ourselves delivering normalized operating and financial performance. This reinforces our confidence that we will deliver on our target run rate of around \u20ac5 billion per quarter for adjusted costs, including the first quarter of this year. Our guidance for the full year 2025 non-interest rate expenses remains unchanged, at around \u20ac20 billion. We again demonstrated our resilience, with high-quality risk management and our strong capital and balance sheet. All of this leaves us highly confident that we will meet our 2025 financial targets. Furthermore, we are increasing our capital distributions, as rewarding our shareholders is our priority. We increased both dividends and share buybacks by 50% compared to 2022. We plan to propose a dividend of $0.45 per share at the AGM, approximately \u20ac900 million in total, for the financial year 2023; and we have regulatory approval for a further \u20ac675 million in share buybacks, which we intend to complete in the first half of 2024. And our raised capital outlook, which we outlined last quarter, has created scope to accelerate and expand distributions further. We now expect to significantly outperform our original \u20ac8 billion target for the financial years 2021 through 2025; and we would consider proposing a dividend of \u20ac1 per share in respect of 2025, subject to our 50% payout ratio. Let\u2019s first discuss business growth, starting with our 2023 revenue performance on Slide 2. We delivered sustained growth and improved quality of earnings streams with a well-balanced business mix. Revenues were in line with our guidance, at around \u20ac29 billion, up 6% year-on-year. 78% of our revenues came from recurring earnings streams, up from 71% in 2020. We benefitted from rising interest rates, notably in the Corporate Bank and Private Bank. We also focused on building out our fee business across all businesses and here let me give you a few examples. In the Corporate Bank, we developed innovative products, hired relationship managers in strategic areas, and deepened relationships with key clients. This was already evidenced by the growth in fee income in the fourth quarter. We also added senior bankers in client-facing areas in International Private Bank and the Investment Bank, and completed the acquisition of Numis. We attracted net inflows of \u20ac57 billion across the Private Bank and Asset Management, which helped to grow Assets under Management by \u20ac115 billion, to \u20ac1.5 trillion. Our progress in strengthening our franchise has been recognized with upgrades from the leading rating agencies, which further positions us well to deepen engagement with current and new clients. Now let\u2019s look ahead at our revenue pathway to 2025 on Slide 3. Since 2021, we have demonstrated revenue momentum well ahead of our original target growth rate, due in part to a supportive interest rate environment. We are confident that as interest rates normalize, we can maintain a solid revenue trajectory. And this is supported by the expected growth in noninterest income, which already accounts for more than half of Group revenues, and our investments in capital light activities. Based on this, we are raising our revenue target from between 3.5% and 4.5% to between 5.5% and 6.5%, for the period 2021 through 2025, aiming to reach around \u20ac32 billion in 2025. We expect non-interest income growth to contribute approximately 2.5 percentage points to the targeted compound annual growth between 2021 and 2025. And this is achievable through a number of levers: growing share of wallet in the Corporate Bank; reaping the benefits of investments in Origination & Advisory; building on our recent strong relative performance in our FIC business; expanding fee-generating businesses in the Private Bank; benefitting from investments and growing capital-light lending businesses; delivering on our growth strategies, including Passive; and taking full advantage of market recovery, in Asset Management. Additionally, across both the Private Bank and Asset Management, we aim to convert 2023\u2019s net inflows and growth in assets under management into revenues.  In respect of net interest income growth, we expect it to contribute approximately four percentage points to the targeted compound annual growth between 2021 and 2025. This reflects a normalization in 2024, followed by further growth in 2025 and beyond, and James will expand on this shortly. Let me now take you through additional details on how we plan to grow non-interest revenues on Slide 4. In the Corporate Bank, we already have stable sources of fee income from our payments business, trade finance offering, custody business as well as trust and agency services. We have invested into our payment platforms and enhancing sector-specific coverage teams. In terms of products, we also continue our investments into fee generating Merchant Solutions and Digital Asset Custody to support future fee growth. We are accelerating the cross-divisional solution offering, for example, FX, hedging and risk management products, and we are helping corporates with their sustainability transition. In the Investment Bank, we have one of the leading FIC platforms, with around 35% of revenues coming from our Financing business. We have consistently said that we aim to grow Financing and FIC trading activities by developing the existing businesses, growing our Americas footprint and increasing client penetration. In O&A, revenues saw a low point in 2022; we expect fees to be driven, this year and next, by some market recovery combined with the benefits of our investments. We hired strategically across many sectors and acquired Numis to create a leading position in the UK. All this will help us to deepen and broaden our client relationships and further develop our ESG capabilities. In the Private Bank we aim to grow revenues from investment products at around 10% per year over the next years. We are confident we can achieve this, given our strong asset generation, investments in hiring in the international franchise, and enhancement of digital channels. We will also expand our Lombard lending business in Wealth Management and the Bank for Entrepreneurs. In addition to our focus on Germany, we are intensifying our business development in growing markets such as Asia and the Middle East. In Asset Management, to give you a few examples on our growth initiatives. We are building on Xtrackers momentum via product innovation and we are expanding internationally. Within Alternatives, we want to focus on Credit in Europe and Real Estate Debt in the U.S., and we will be strengthening fixed income and multi asset capabilities to increase potential for scaling up. And I\u2019m encouraged by the start we\u2019ve had in January so far, with revenue performance that supports this trajectory. Now let me turn to operating efficiency on Slide 5. Our 2023 cost base was impacted by inflation, business growth and investments to accelerate execution of our Global Hausbank strategy on three dimensions, improving operational efficiency, growing sustainable revenues, and strengthening our control environment. About \u20ac400 million of these additional investments are nonrecurring and mainly related to improvements of our operational efficiency, severance charges for targeted reductions in senior non-client facing roles and real estate one-offs. We also recognized an impairment of goodwill related to Numis. Some of these non-recurring items arose in the fourth quarter, alongside other exceptional items which James will discuss shortly. We also made business investments of \u20ac200 million which will remain in our run-rate. We saw incremental savings of around \u20ac340 million from our operational efficiency measures this year. These will more than offset the run-rate impact of the investments, which reflects our approach of self-funding our investments. On business growth, we have invested in capital-light businesses, as we just discussed. On controls, we further strengthened key functions with the addition of around 1,000 dedicated professionals across all regions to ensure thought leadership and increased dedicated spending to around \u20ac1.2 billion in 2023. Our investments over the years have materially improved our controls. For example, we have built automated tools into our KYC controls, to dynamically review client activity and tighten quality control standards. We have significantly upgraded our core control applications, for example, we successfully migrated our Euro clearing business onto a new strategic transaction monitoring platform. We made material strides in re-engineering processes front-to-back and the progress so far has made our bank safer. As our remediation work across key regulatory programs is anticipated to approach completion, we expect our focus during 2024 to gradually shift from remediation to a sustainable business as usual risk management. We also continued to put longstanding legal matters behind us in 2023, and we expect to see the benefits of our improved operating model coming through from 2024. We believe these investments will positively impact operating leverage, by boosting revenue growth while keeping costs essentially stable to 2022 levels, as we set out on Slide 6. We see a clear path to costs of approximately \u20ac20 billion in 2025. Over the next two years, our aim is to drive reductions across both non-operating costs and our adjusted cost base, by managing our run rate and driving efficiency measures. We foresee reductions in non-operating costs of around \u20ac700 million from 2023 levels in the next two years. The \u20ac233 million impairment of goodwill relating to Numis is now behind us, and we see restructuring and severance charges coming down by around \u20ac400 million from 2023 levels. On adjusted costs, as we have already communicated, we see bank levies coming down by between \u20ac350 million and \u20ac400 million over the next two years. The additional \u20ac400 million net reduction will come from further progress on our operational efficiency program, so let me give you some additional detail on where we stand with our \u20ac2.5 billion efficiency measures. We have already executed on measures with delivered or expected savings of \u20ac1.3 billion, of which around \u20ac900 million of savings were realized to date. The residual savings of \u20ac1.6 billion are as follows: on Germany optimization, we anticipate savings of around \u20ac600 million, reflecting our strategic ambition to increase profitability in our core home market. On technology and infrastructure, we anticipate roughly \u20ac700 million of savings from a number of items, including application decommissioning and other operating model improvements. And finally, on front-to-back process re-design, we anticipate about \u20ac300 million from simplified workflows and automation. Included in these measures is the reduction of 3,500 roles, mainly in non-client facing areas. The vast majority of these measures will be in our 2025 run-rate. With that, we have material capacity to more than offset inflation and the impact from our business growth plans. Our detailed implementation roadmap gives us confidence in delivering non-interest expenses of approximately \u20ac20 billion in 2025, giving us a clear pathway to our cost/income ratio target of 62.5%. We\u2019re conscious that we\u2019re operating in a fast-changing environment. Our path towards 2025 may be impacted by external factors, and we have taken this into account. We have the toolkit in place to implement additional measures which would enable us to further flex our cost base to meet our cost/income ratio target, even if we see unforeseen revenue headwinds. Now let me turn to capital, liquidity and risk management on Slide 7. In 2023, we proved our resilience in a challenging environment. We demonstrated first-class risk management, with a high-quality and well-diversified loan book, supported by multiple risk mitigants. Our provision for credit losses was 31 basis points of average loans, marginally above guidance range and also reflecting overlay changes applied in the fourth quarter. Liquidity has remained very robust, and with substantial buffers above required levels. In addition, our balance sheet is strong. We have a large and healthy diversified deposit base, mainly in our domestic market. Furthermore, we demonstrated strong capital management; we ended the year with a robust CET1 ratio, at 13.7%. Now let me turn to our plans for distributions to shareholders on Slide 8. Our strong organic capital generation and disciplined capital management, allowed us both to digest the significant regulatory inflation of the last two years, and support our business growth, while still being in a position to distribute around 30% of our net income to shareholders. Consistent with prior guidance, we now see scope to shift gears on capital distributions and to increase shareholder distributions to 50% of net income to shareholders from the full year 2024. In October, we set out plans to accelerate and expand our distributions, having raised our capital outlook by around \u20ac3 billion through 2025. With the distributions announced today and our positive capital outlook, we are on track to significantly outperform against our original distribution target. Let me conclude with a few words on our strategy, on Slide 9. We have seen rising uncertainties, in the global economy and across the geopolitical landscape, since we launched our Global Hausbank strategy early in 2022. These developments prove that our strategy is the right one for our clients and for Deutsche Bank. We have seen, more than ever, that clients want and need a partner with the expertise, product breadth and global network to help them navigate a more uncertain environment. A European partner, capable of helping and advising them across the world. The progress we have made, on all key dimensions, gives us a clear path to our 2025 targets. Having sharpened our business model, we have raised our revenue targets and made focused investments to boost revenues further, especially all in capital light businesses and we\u2019re seizing the opportunities offered by our technology investments to expand our digital offering to clients. We have already completed operational efficiency measures, which take us around halfway towards our \u20ac2.5 billion target. And we\u2019re well positioned to increase our goals for capital distributions to shareholders through 2025. With that, let me hand over to James.\nJames von Moltke: Thank you, Christian. Let me start with a few key performance indicators on Slide 11, and place them in the context of our 2025 targets. Christian outlined our business momentum and well-balanced revenue mix, which resulted in revenue growth of 6.6% on a compound basis for the last two years, relative to 2021. This performance puts us well on track to deliver revenue growth in line with our new target. Our strong franchise growth led to a 10 percentage point improvement in the cost/income ratio to 75% against 2021, with the last two years being pivotal investment years. Our return on tangible equity was 7.4% in the full year of 2023, including a benefit from deferred tax asset valuation. Our capital position remained strong with the CET1 ratio at 13.7% at year-end after absorbing regulatory headwinds. Our liquidity metrics also remained strong; LCR was 140%, above our target of around 130%, and the net stable funding ratio was 122%. In short, our performance in the period reaffirms our resilience and our confidence in reaching our 2025 targets. With that, let me turn to the fourth quarter highlights on Slide 12. Group revenues were \u20ac6.7 billion, up 5% on the fourth quarter of 2022 or 10% excluding specific items. Non-interest expenses were \u20ac5.5 billion, up 5% year-on-year. Non-operating expenses were down by 45% compared to the prior year period, mainly reflecting a release of litigation provisions. At the same time, we booked items related to strategy execution, including the impairments of goodwill and other intangibles of around \u20ac230 million, and restructuring and severance provisions of nearly \u20ac200 million. We generated a profit before tax of \u20ac698 million, down 10% year-on-year, which mainly reflects the increase in adjusted costs and the non-repeat of the gain on the sale reported in the prior year quarter. Net profit of \u20ac1.4 billion was down 28% year-on-year, reflecting a lower DTA valuation adjustment compared to the prior year quarter. Our cost/income ratio was 82% and our post-tax return on average tangible common equity was 8.8% in the quarter. Diluted earnings per share was \u20ac0.67 in the fourth quarter and tangible book value per share was \u20ac28.41, up 6% year-on-year. Let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results. Let me start with a review of our net interest income on Slide 13, which also provides an outlook for the next two years. The numbers are based on market expectations for interest rates as of 26th January this year. Our reported net interest income of \u20ac13.6 billion was broadly stable for the group in 2023 compared to the prior year, but that does not reflect the economic contribution to group revenues due to significant moves in accounting effects, which are offset in non-interest revenues. Focusing on our three key NII generating business units, as well as other funding costs not offset by accounting effects, we see an improvement of just over \u20ac2 billion and a cumulative benefit since 2021 of over \u20ac4 billion. Looking ahead on the same basis, we expect a decline of around \u20ac600 million in 2024, driven by the convergence of betas to steady state levels. We expect this to be followed by an increase of around \u20ac400 million in 2025, which brings us close to 2023 NII levels, as the beta convergence is largely offset by the rollover of our hedge portfolios as well as balance sheet growth. In line with prior guidance, we expect a larger sequential reduction in the Corporate Bank than in the Private Bank in 2024. We expect a sequential improvement excluding accounting asymmetries in the Corporate & Other division of around \u20ac300 million relating to reduced funding costs for corporate assets and lower retained liquidity and other funding costs. We prepared additional slides on NII which are in appendix but the key messages I want to highlight are that: We have around \u20ac230 billion of long-term interest rate hedges on our deposits and equity. The majority of these hedges are entered into with a 10-year tenor and the weighted average maturity of the portfolio is four to five years. We expect \u20ac2.5 billion of NII from interest rate hedges in 2024, of which more than 90% is locked in with existing positions. Once deposit betas have converged to steady state levels, our NII sensitivity will mostly be to long-term rates, as our hedge portfolio rolls over with limited sensitivity to short-term rates unless moves are sharp enough to re-introduce beta lags or approach the zero bound. We may outperform this guidance if market expectations regarding rate cuts do not fully materialize or deposit betas increase more slowly than expected. With that, let\u2019s turn to adjusted cost development, on Slide 14. First, our guidance for full year 2023 adjusted costs was essentially flat compared to 2022, as we absorbed the impacts from inflation, ongoing investments and business growth, which Christian discussed earlier. We made it clear that this guidance included an expectation that the German banking industry would receive a restitution payment from a national resolution fund in the fourth quarter. And as we announced in our pre-close document, this payment was not included in the recently announced budget. While our full year adjusted costs were up 3% year-on-year, in line with our guidance, the fourth quarter adjusted costs of \u20ac5.3 billion were up 9% year-on-year, higher than the initial expectations. We had around \u20ac210 million of exceptional items in the fourth quarter resulting in adjusted costs excluding bank levies of \u20ac5.26 billion. About \u20ac90 million of these exceptional items are not expected to repeat in the following quarters. About \u20ac35 million of costs related to Private Bank service remediation are expected to taper off over time and around \u20ac80 million of other costs should normalize. Reflecting on the nature of these exceptional items and considering savings coming through from efficiency measures, we expect to return to a run-rate of around \u20ac5 billion in the first quarter of this year. Let\u2019s now turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 15. Provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter was \u20ac488 million, equivalent to 41 basis points of average loans. The quarter-on-quarter development in Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions of \u20ac30 million mainly reflects the non-recurrence of model related adjustments in the previous quarter and the application of an overlay in this quarter. Stage 3 provisions of \u20ac457 million were also higher compared to the prior quarter as we saw elevated levels mainly in the Private Bank and Corporate Bank, partly offset by a provision reduction in the Investment Bank. Full year provisions were 31 basis points and reflect higher Stage 3 provisions related to commercial real estate in the Investment Bank and certain one-offs in the Private Bank, partly offset by lower Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions, as well as a slower-than-expected loan growth. Before we move to performance in our businesses, let me turn to capital on the next two slides, starting with Slide 16. Our fourth quarter Common Equity Tier 1 ratio came in at 13.7%, a 20 basis points decrease compared to the previous quarter. This quarter-on-quarter reduction reflect lower capital as our net income was more than offset by capital deductions, most notably for shareholder dividends, AT1 coupons and deferred tax assets. Risk weighted assets were flat over the quarter. Credit risk RWA increased over the quarter reflecting business growth and model changes. These increases were partly offset by capital optimization initiatives as we continue to focus on the capital efficiency of our balance sheet. Lower market risk and operational risk RWA more than offset higher credit risk RWA over the quarter, reflecting lower market volatility and an improved risk profile. At the end of the fourth quarter our leverage ratio was 4.5%, reflecting a lower capital position and higher leverage exposure. Building on Christian\u2019s earlier comments on the inflection point in our capital base on Slide 17. Let me give you a view how we want to manage our capital through 2025, as our profitability is improving and delivering more sustainable net income. First, in line with our ambition, we want to pay out 50% of net income to our shareholders. Second, we will aim to deploy about 25% of net income into the businesses to support further growth. Finally, we expect the remaining 25% will provide us with a buffer for additional capital use, the final implementation of CRR3 and further distributions, acquisitions or an increase in our capital ratio. Let me also give you an update on our capital efficiency program. In the fourth quarter we delivered RWA relief of a further \u20ac3 billion, mainly from additional securitizations, which brings the achieved reduction to \u20ac13 billion, and means we remain on course for our \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion target, and we aim to deliver further progress in 2024. Let me give you some more details on our intentions regarding shareholder distributions. In March 2022, we set a goal to increase dividends per share by 50% for three consecutive years, which we are on track to deliver. As the slide indicates, subject to a 50% pay-out ratio, we believe there will be scope to extend the 50% increase objective to 2025, suggesting a dividend of \u20ac1 per share could be paid in 2026. This would bring the total dividend payments over the five-year period to over \u20ac5 billion. At the same time, we are continuing to increase share buybacks. And as Christian mentioned, we will execute a further \u20ac675 million program in the first half of 2024, which is again a 50% increase on the buyback program we completed last year. Finally, given our strong capital and earnings outlook, we see significant scope for further share buybacks and therefore a clear path to outperform our original distribution target of \u20ac8 billion. Let\u2019s now turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 20. Corporate Bank revenues in the fourth quarter were \u20ac1.9 billion, 9% higher compared to a prior year quarter, which already reflected the early stages of the interest rate cycle. The interest rate environment remained favorable, with revenues further supported by the continued pricing discipline, a solid deposit base and higher commission and fee income. Sequentially, revenues increased slightly, driven by higher net interest income from higher average balances with corporate and institutional clients and higher commission and fee income in our Institutional Client Services business. We continue to anticipate a normalization of our deposit revenues over the coming quarters which we expect to be partially offset by growing non-interest-rate-sensitive revenue streams. Loan volume in the Corporate Bank declined by \u20ac5 billion compared to the prior year quarter and remained stable sequentially, compensating for the impact of FX movements. Deposits were \u20ac289 billion, \u20ac3 billion higher than in the third quarter with an increased share of term deposit balances compared to the prior year. Provision for credit losses was 26 basis points of average loans. The moderate increase versus the prior year was driven by higher Stage 3 provisions across various portfolios. Noninterest expenses significantly increased year on year, driven by the FDIC special assessment charge in the current quarter and adjustments to the internal service cost allocations in the prior year quarter. This resulted in a post-tax return on tangible equity of 15% and a cost/income ratio of 60%. I\u2019ll now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 21. Revenues for the fourth quarter were 10% higher year on year on a reported basis and 8% higher excluding specific items. Revenues in FIC Sales & Trading increased by 1% versus an already strong prior year quarter and represented the highest fourth quarter revenues since 2010. Credit Trading revenues were significantly higher driven by continued strong performance in Distressed and ongoing improvements in the Flow business. The performance of Flow reflects the successful execution of our strategic initiatives and the investments made through 2023. Emerging Markets revenues were also significantly higher driven by increased client activity in Asia. Financing revenues were slightly lower versus the prior year quarter, but essentially flat on a full year basis. Rates and Foreign Exchange revenues were both significantly lower when compared to a very strong prior year quarter and reflected an overall decline in market activity and volatility. Moving to Origination & Advisory, revenues were up 56% when compared to the prior year quarter but down slightly sequentially due to deal slippage into the first quarter of 2024. Debt origination revenues were significantly higher benefitting from an improved LDCM performance, including the non-repeat of hedge losses in the prior year quarter. The leveraged loan market saw a partial recovery from a market that was largely inactive in the prior year. Advisory revenues were slightly lower compared to the prior year period. However, we expect the previously communicated investments into targeted sectors and regions during 2023 to drive improved performance this year against an improving industry backdrop. Non-interest expenses were significantly higher year-on-year, largely the result of a one-off impairment of goodwill related to our investment in the acquisition of Numis. Adjusted costs were slightly higher reflecting targeted investments in Origination & Advisory, which includes the Numis acquisition. Leverage exposure, risk-weighted assets and loans were all broadly stable year-on-year. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac186 million or 73 basis points of average loans. The increase versus the prior year quarter was primarily driven by the model impact on Stage 1 and 2 performing loans, with Stage 3 impairments also higher and primarily driven by Commercial Real Estate. Turning to the Private Bank on Slide 22. Private Bank revenues were \u20ac2.4 billion in the quarter, up 9% year-on-year if adjusted for the gain on sale of around \u20ac310 million related to the Financials Advisors business in Italy last year. Private Bank Germany revenues increased by 10% year-on-year mainly driven by interest income, reflecting strong deposit margins. In the International Private Bank revenues were up 9% year-on-year if adjusted for specific items and FX movements. The growth was driven by episodic revenues in lending, and higher deposit revenues across Europe and Middle East, which were partially offset by continued muted capital market activity and client deleveraging in APAC. Turning to costs, non-interest expenses were significantly higher year-on-year driven by approximately \u20ac100 million of restructuring and severance costs as well as investments in strategic initiatives, Postbank service remediation costs and inflation. These were partly mitigated by continued savings from transformation programs and lower internal cost allocations. Fourth quarter provisions for credit losses of 30 basis points of average loans continue to reflect temporary effects caused by the operational backlog. The development of the overall portfolio continuously reflects the high quality of the loan book, especially in the retail businesses, and ongoing tight risk discipline. The business attracted strong net inflow into asset under management of \u20ac7 billion mainly in deposits. Let me continue with Asset Management on Slide 23. My usual reminder, the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Assets under management increased to \u20ac896 billion in the quarter, supported by net inflows and positive market appreciation of \u20ac40 billion, partly offset by negative FX effects. Net inflows of \u20ac11 billion were primarily in Passive once again, continuing the positive momentum we have seen throughout the year, as well as in Cash products. Revenues declined by 5% versus the prior year. This was primarily the result of a decline in management fees to \u20ac575 million. Other revenues declined due to lower investment income and higher funding charges. Compensation and benefits costs were higher mainly driven by a change in accounting treatment related to carried interest in the prior year quarter, partly offset by lower other variable compensation. Non-compensation costs were also higher, reflecting support for transformation and costs related to growth in assets under management. In the prior year period non-operating costs included a significant impairment charge for an unamortized intangible asset which is not repeated this year. Profit before tax is significantly lower than the prior year period, mainly impacted by lower revenues. The cost/income ratio for the quarter was 81% and return on tangible equity was 7.1%. Moving to Corporate & Other on Slide 24. Corporate & Other reported a pre-tax loss of \u20ac14 million this quarter, versus the equivalent pre-tax loss of \u20ac535 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This improvement was primarily driven by a net litigation release of \u20ac287 million in this quarter. Valuation and timing differences were positive \u20ac142 million compared to \u20ac48 million in the prior year quarter, in part driven by the reversal of prior year losses. The pre-tax profit associated with legacy portfolios was \u20ac75 million, primarily reflecting the aforementioned litigation release. Funding and liquidity impacts were negative \u20ac111 million in the quarter, bringing the full year in line with our guidance. Expenses associated with shareholder activities were \u20ac147 million in the quarter which we see as the new quarterly run rate. At the end of the fourth quarter, risk weighted assets were \u20ac40 billion, including \u20ac19 billion of operational risk RWA, and leverage exposure was \u20ac39 billion. For the full year, the loss before tax in C&O was \u20ac553 million.  Looking into 2024, we expect the pre-tax loss for Corporate and Other to be more negative, given the non-repeat of the aforementioned litigation release. As usual this includes some uncertainty, particularly associated with Valuation and Timing differences. Turning to the Group outlook on Slide 25. As Christian and I have outlined, we are increasingly confident in our growth path, particularly in our ambitions to grow fee income across divisions. We have revised our revenue growth target to 5.5% to 6.5% over the 2021 to 2025 period, supported by investments across all business areas and a more favorable economic and market backdrop. We are fully focused on delivering our cost plan and we see our noninterest expenses reducing due to the non-repeat of certain nonoperating costs, as well as management actions to maintain our targeted quarterly run-rate of \u20ac5 billion of adjusted costs. We expect provisions for credit losses to remain at around 25 to 30 basis points of average loans in 2024. As we outlined last quarter, we have passed an inflection point in our capital management plan which supports our intention to distribute roughly half of our generated net income to shareholders, which, alongside with cost management, is our key management priority. And finally, with our first half \u20ac675 million share buyback approved, we are poised to further accelerate distributions beyond our baseline expectations. With that, let me hand back to Ioana and we look forward to your questions.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you, James. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Chris Hallam from Goldman Sachs International. Please go ahead with your question.\nChris Hallam: Yes. Good morning, everybody. Just two from me. First, on distribution, looking at Slide 18, I guess if I take all those numbers together, would I be wrong in saying that the \u20ac8 billion distribution target is now about 25% higher at around \u20ac10 billion? And for this year, consensus has about \u20ac1 billion in share buybacks with respect to 2023 results. Now, you've announced \u20ac675 million and said that there is more to come. So just do you feel comfortable with the \u20ac1 billion figure that consensus has in? And then second, on costs, obviously, there was a lot of one-offs in Q4. And I guess we're going to see the \u20ac5 billion underlying from Q1, as you mentioned. But just as we start the year, what can you see in terms of one-offs for 2024 and maybe for 2025 as well?\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, Chris, and good morning to everybody and thank you for your question. Let me start with the capital question and then James will take the cost question. Look let me go back to the Investor Day 2022 because I think it's important that \u2013 that we all understand the path which we have announced there, in particular also regard with the capital path and the \u20ac8 billion. Since then, since March 2022, we have consistently delivered on that what we have told you. And that is no different today. And our focus has always been on the execution of our strategy and the commitment actually on the one hand to focus on our clients. But, Chris, more and more what we have done in the management board of Deutsche Bank is actually to put the shareholders into the middle of focus what we are doing. Now with the investments which we have done, with the business how it develops, with the inflection point we see on regulatory remediation, taking the regulatory increases into our capital in and digesting it, we can clearly see that we are at the inflection point on our franchise, but in particular also when it comes to our capital position. And hence we can see that we have now the room to further step up. And that is then the result that we said already last year in October that we see based on the efficient capital management, the operating strengths of the business, the earnings profile, that we see \u20ac3 billion of incremental capital at our disposal. And, of course, it is our aim that a significant part of these \u20ac3 billion will be actually distributed to our shareholders. Again, also with the view that it's now the time that the shareholders go actually also into the center of what we are doing. Now what does it mean concretely? And also there, Chris, if we compare this year to last year, last year in the January earnings call, we did not actually talk about and had the approval for a share buyback. You see our confidence overall in the way the bank has done and on which way we are, and therefore we ask for the approval of the \u20ac675 million last year. We got the approval now. And that also means to your second question there on the way for 2024, in case, and I'm very confident just looking at January, in case our business performance runs as we forecasted in Q1, I think there is an opportunity and we should obviously aspire to go for a second approach this year. And that we already have the approval for the first one in January is I think a big difference to last year. Secondly, if I now look at the overall earnings capacity of the bank, how the revenues stack up, and also what James will tell you about the cost line, I really clearly can see that we can change the payout in terms of what we retain and what goes to the shareholders to a fifty-fifty. And it is clearly our goal that the 50% increase which we committed to in the last years, which we have done, is also something which we want to do going forward. Of course, subject to our earnings forecast, but again, we are highly confident. And that would mean, I mean, you mentioned the number, you know where the consensus is, that that obviously results in a number where I said, yes, I would like to actually go to consensus when it comes to share buybacks and capital distribution in total.\nJames von Moltke: So, and Chris, it is James. On the expense side, look, Q4 was messy. We had advertised that there were some items that we were expecting. We obviously try to give you as much of a forward look as we can. But as you can see on Page 14, there was a bunch of things that sort of tumbled out that some of which caught us by surprise. I would say as a great example, the FDIC assessment, the way it was formulated and crafted, brought basically two years' worth of assessment into the one quarter. And if I go to another question that frequently comes up on these calls, what flexibility do we have to offset? While we think that ForEx flexibility is greater than it has been in the past, \u20ac50 million coming out of nowhere in late November, early December is not something you can really offset at that point in time. But your question is what comfort can we give you that the one-offs are coming to an end? I think our goal is to deliver a much cleaner, more predictable profile. And the last few years have been anything but that with transformation charges, obviously the bank levy that introduces volatility, some of the litigation items that have come at us that we hadn't expected to fall out the way they did. And while we can, you can never guarantee that there won't be new things coming up, if I look at the various risks and uncertainties that lie ahead, they're much fewer than lies behind us. And so I'd like to think that our path to normalization is close. There would be, I mean, if I look to 2024, we do expect some restructuring charges in 2024, perhaps \u20ac400 million, that's still an elevated level relative to what I would think of as normalized. And clearly our goal is that by 2025, we will have normalized in respect of both restructuring and severance and litigation. So one of the reasons our investment in non-financial risk is so critical in the control environments is, stop making ourselves vulnerable to those types of things. So we do think we're much closer to providing a normalized picture and also to having the levers in our hands to offset adverse developments better.\nChris Hallam: Okay, thanks. Really helpful, thank you.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChristian Sewing: Kian, are you there, or are you on mute?\nOperator: Mr. Abouhossein, your line is open.\nKian Abouhossein: Yes, sorry. Yes, apologies, I was on mute. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question is related to trading revenues, which you indicated, I think James, has started very well. And I just wanted to see what you're comparing this to, is this year-on-year comparison? And what is driving that, I assume, in fixed income? Secondly, can you also talk clearly in that context around the investment banking fee pool where I think you also indicated momentum is continuing from what you said earlier at a recent conference. And then secondly, just coming back to cost, clearly the target is adjusted cost \u20ac5 billion, about \u20ac5 billion, and just if you can talk a little bit about the levers that you have in case you will not be able to get to about \u20ac5 billion and what \u20ac5 billion about actually mean, is plus or minus 4%, 5%, how should we think about that?\nChristian Sewing: Thank you. Let me start, and then James will for sure add. Look, Kian, thanks for your question. I think on the trading revenues, we know it's obviously early days with January, but what are we doing? We are comparing it to last year. We are comparing it to our own plan. And we also look at the consistency actually of the day-to-day trading also with regard to our VAR. And it looks very healthy. It looks very kind of a consistent picture across the different sectors in the trading area. So it is broad based across the regions. And I would say one reason for the strong start is for sure that we have been investing and Ram has really built up the FIC business over the last five years, quarter-by-quarter. And of course, the latest rating upgrade by S&P also helps. I mean, these are all things which are then self fulfilling, so to say, you will remember my speeches that each rating upgrade also means that obviously clients are coming back, are doing different and more trades with us. We are changing the ISTAS [ph], all that is coming through. And therefore, we can see that, yes, January was good and nice and better than we expected. But I can see from the basis and foundation that in my view, this is a quite consistent trend. And I also expect. By the way, we said that 78% of the 2023 revenue year were recurring revenues, which is a pretty good picture. And therefore, I also expect, with all the investments we have done in the sort of say more stable business that we have a solid and strong start into January. On the fee income in the O&A. Yes, we expect a recovery in 2024. It is always very hard to say when exactly, but we have planned our investments last year in terms of the Numis acquisition, but also in terms of the hiring on the O&A side, with regard to a long-term development of the bank. We wanted to invest into our capital-light business and fortunately, we can now see the results of that. So also here, we can see a recovery in terms of mandates, a recovery in terms of market activities. And therefore, we do believe that we will see, compared to 2023, a nice uptick in the revenues. And the first results we have already seen also in January. But again, I know it's just the first 30 days of the year, but also they are very promising and that what we wanted to achieve is coming through. On the cost side, look, James just said it and he will give you more details, but, A, we have a full focus to Q4, showing you already in Q1 that we hit a \u20ac5 billion run rate in Q1. This has daily management, daily monitoring, weekly in the management board. And I'm very confident that we will achieve that number of around \u20ac5.0 billion in Q1. Now, why am I overall so confident on that? Because of that, what James said. I mean, if you take the \u20ac21.7 billion cost and we need to come to \u20ac20 billion, we will expect non-operating costs to decrease by around \u20ac700 million. We will again expect approximately a reduction of bank levies in the amount of \u20ac350 million to \u20ac400 million in 2024 versus 2023. That would bring us roughly to \u20ac20.5 billion. And now we are looking at that, what we are constantly managing with the front office, with the back offices, under Rebecca's leadership. And that means we expect that we have another \u20ac400 million net reduction from all what is still coming of our operational efficiency program. You know, the \u20ac2.5 billion of gross reductions, we have delivered savings, or expected savings of \u20ac1.3 billion, of which \u20ac900 million have been realized up to now. And the remainder comes from \u20ac600 million in Germany. In the optimization, Claudio is doing, in particular, on the business side, with all the rationalization, on the branch side, with all the investments which have been done into unity, and now we are getting the fruits out of this. We have on technology and infrastructure, another \u20ac700 million, which we will reduce application decommissioning and so on. And then you know that we are, for our core processes, we have invested a lot of money and we will do this also going forward in the front to back process redesign, where we think we will get another \u20ac300 million out. Now, against that, there is obviously some inflation, some business growth, but that makes us highly, highly confident that we can get the next \u20ac400 million to \u20ac500 million of operational efficiency net out. And that brings us to the \u20ac20 billion. The good thing is that is the long-term plan for 2024 and 2025. But if you see the bottom up plan for the first quarter, we will achieve the 5.0 on a rounded basis this quarter.\nJames von Moltke: So \u2013 and Kian, I entirely endorse what Christian just went through, and it\u2019s just to put a couple of numbers behind it as well. In FIC, I would draw your attention to Page 47 of the analyst deck, where we tried to give you a little bit more color on how the FIC franchise performs on a daily basis. And relative to its VaR, and so it gives you a good kind of comparison as to what so far the quarter might look like compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. I think the second thing to add the \u2013 in the corporate finance wallet, if you look at some of the external sort of providers of data on that marketplace, I think those providers would say that the will \u2013 that the wallet will grow sort of 15% to 20% this year, as Christian just outlined, that obviously still needs to happen, but we think the conditions are there. And as Christian just outlined through Numis and the other hires we\u2019ve invested to participate in that. And then lastly on expenses, to give you a sense of what we would think is a significant \u2013 is a range of outcomes, 1% rather than 4% is that we have the discipline, and for us missing by 1% or \u20ac50 million would be a disappointment. And that gives you a sense of how we\u2019re managing the place.\nKian Abouhossein: Very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Adam Terelak from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nAdam Terelak: Good morning. Thank you for the questions. One on revenues and one on costs. On the revenue side, you\u2019ve given a lot of detail on NII and NII trajectory. You\u2019ve given us \u20ac32 billion for 2025, hinted to \u20ac30 billion still for this year. But could you put a little bit more meat on the bones, please? That would be by division and expectations by division, but also on the non-NII growth in terms of what you see in terms of fee momentum and beyond the \u2013 our NII piece, but also on loan growth as well, which clearly is baked into your NII assumptions. So some more color around revenue and revenue expectations on why we should be as bullish as you guys are with the great. And secondly, on cost and cost trajectory, you\u2019re talking to \u20ac5 billion for Q1. Clearly the run rate for next year is going to be below that if you\u2019re going to get to \u20ac20 billion. So what does that adjusted cost look like through this year? Do we actually end up kind of below \u20ac5 billion by the end of the year? And so the adjusted cost print could be in kind of the \u20ac20 billion range for 2024. Obviously, the reported number might be higher, but I\u2019m thinking about adjusted cost only at this stage. Thank you.\nJames von Moltke: So I\u2019ll \u2013 I can start. Christian, you may want to add. So on revenues, Adam, first of all, I \u2013 we provided the additional disclosure on net interest revenues or net interest income to try to sort of put that to one side. Hopefully, that\u2019s helpful disclosure and indicates the relatively high degree of confidence we have on delivery against that, whether that\u2019s by hedging out the remaining sort of curve or also indicating how conservative we think we\u2019re being on, for example, beta assumptions and growth in volumes. But set that to one side and then that allows you to focus on the non-interest revenues. There to give you a sense, we think all of the businesses are poised to grow their revenues on non-interest side pretty considerably. When you just think of all the sources of non-interest revenues we have, I mean, start with a Corporate Bank, custody transactions, payments, the merchant acquiring business, the documentary custody business. We earn fees and across that business in lots of different ways that do cohere with the overall sort of performance and level of activity in the marketplace. In Asset Management and Private Bank, obviously the assets under management are the key driver and therefore our inflows are encouraging to us. It means our step off into 2024 is higher than the average considerably in both businesses that we ran at in 2023. And we also think in general investor behavior particularly in the international private bank wealth management business has been relatively muted. So we think there's growth opportunity as well. And that then leads you to the investment bank, we've talked about where we \u2013 what we see as a recovery in origination and advisory coupled with potentially market share expansion, given the investments that we've made. And that's encouraging to us. And we think there's also runway in FIC as we've continued to put investments in place across sort of, I won't call them, the adjacency. So within our footprint areas where we think we're underperforming our potential. And Ram and his team have been very deliberate executing on those investments. We think that also will provide a strong backdrop. In terms of \u2013 to give you orders of magnitude, obviously the origination advisory piece is the largest in terms of our expectations in absolute terms. But it's also the market in our view that has been most muted in the past couple of years. So there we think of it less as growth from a foundation rather than recovery. And that's something we see the preconditions as clearly in place for.\nChristian Sewing: I just want to add one item and just to give you a little bit of a feel, Adam, also how stable the revenues, for instance, in the corporate bank has performed over the last six months. Of course, we have already seen in the corporate bank on a monthly basis some kind of normalization on the NII, but that was always fully compensated already by fee income given our investments, which we have done. And we feel that this is also happening in 2024 given the mandates which we have won. You remember potentially that in October in the earnings call, we talked about the increase of one mandates with multinational corporates. Well, that is continuing and obviously this is helping us now a lot also to go against the NII normalization in the corporate bank. So it is actually a healthy \u2013 it\u2019s a healthy distribution going forward. And if I then think from a starting point of view that we have, as James is just saying, \u20ac57 billion of additional assets under management in the private bank and in asset management. And what already that brings us at the start of the year, which we already sort of say captured, that makes us highly confident that we come to that number, which you just quoted, the \u20ac30 billion for 2024.\nJames von Moltke: And just briefly on the run rate, look, we've got to continue working it back down. As you saw in 2023, it crept up a little bit. It was basically \u20ac4.9 billion for much of the year and then it could crept up to \u20ac5 billion as we'd advertised. It did kind of go further than we expected, but we'd like to bring it back to \u20ac5 billion and if possible, below. What that depends on is strong execution of our initiatives, controlling, if you like, the throttling of investments so that we line them up with the crystallization of savings. And to Chris's point at the outset, the absence of surprises. But we feel like we've got the tools in our hands to achieve that and a lot of hard work lies ahead, but we've got a clear path. I do want to say as a proviso, all of that, one of the things we always found difficult in talking about absolute expense numbers is FX can move it around. So you have to keep that in mind. But in general, we're managing to that ex-FX run rate.\nAdam Terelak: Okay, so all else equal \u20ac5 billion is ideally the peak as we look out?\nJames von Moltke: Yes, I think so.\nAdam Terelak: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stuart Graham. Please go ahead with your question.\nStuart Graham: Oh, hi. Thank you for taking my question. I had two, please. The first is on return on tangible book value. As an aside, I didn't see the 10% group target for 2025, but I guess that's still in place. But my question was on the return on tangible in the investment bank. It was only 4% in 2023, after 8.4% in 2022 and 9.4% in 2021. So what's your target return on tangible book for the investment bank in 2025, please? And the second is a geeky question on U.S. CRE, the Q3 stage, you said there was just \u20ac3 billion of U.S. CRE loans to be modified in the next 15 months, but you did \u20ac2.3 billion already in Q4. So what's your revised expectation for the next 12 months in terms of modifications? And do you have an update on the \u20ac0.9 billion stressed lost estimates you gave at the Q3 stage, please? Thank you.\nJames von Moltke: Thanks, Stuart. Look, the IB needs to be above 10% in 2025. Very simply, just it's a kind of law of averages that we have, and what gives us real comfort there is we've been going through some amount of transition as well in the mix of business, where as we shift to more capital light revenue sources, you should be able to see that a strong lift and the investment bank will also benefit from some of the cost saving initiatives that are there in their allocated expenses. So we think their path to that 10%, well above 10%, is reasonably clear. On U.S. CRE, actually, I don\u2019t have a number to hand. We are continuing to work through, and I just want to make one distinction clear. There are maturities and extensions of loans and then modifications. And so we think there\u2019s about \u20ac10 billion of either extension or maturity events to work through this year. Some of which will lead to modifications of various sorts and then applying the percentage that we show you of 4%, 4.5%, you\u2019d expect some of that to obviously translate into credit loss provisions. So hopefully that gives you a sense on both of those questions.\nChristian Sewing: Can I just add, Stuart, because your question on the investment bank is obviously important, and rightly, James went to the composition of revenues and our investments we did in the capital light business, which will obviously help. Secondly, our focus in bringing the cost down is on the infrastructure and he said that. I would also like to mention that if you simply look at the market comparison of Deutsche Bank versus other peers and you look revenues over RWA, the investment bank is doing actually already an excellent job. So it\u2019s now very much about the composition and the balance of revenues, which we are starting and started to address last year with our investments. And I can see that the O&A business is obviously coming back in 2024 and the infrastructure cost. So I think the investment bank on the top line versus RWA is actually already doing an excellent job. And obviously we expect that to be maintained. And last but not least, just for clarification, you indicated it at the start. It\u2019s a full confirmation. Yes, we clearly confirm the larger 10% RoTE for the year 2025. There is no doubt.\nStuart Graham: Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nicolas Payen from Kepler. Please go ahead with your question.\nNicolas Payen: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I have two, please. The first one will be on the litigation write back that you had. It was quite significant, so if you could have a bit more color on what is it related to, please. And the second question is coming back on your U.S. CRE CLP. It has doubled in Q4 versus Q3. So I\u2019d like to know what kind of assumption you have backed in regarding U.S. CRE CLPs for 2024 and how does it fit into your cost of risk assumption of 25 bps to 30 bps for 2024? Thank you very much.\nJames von Moltke: Sure. Nicolas, it\u2019s James. Happy to take the questions. Unfortunately, as you know, we don\u2019t give detailed information about what goes in and out of the litigation provisions. Your point is, it\u2019s a large one and that is fair. I can\u2019t say more, really. It\u2019s a long standing provision that we\u2019ve held and now taken the view there isn\u2019t any more basis to retain it. On CRE, look, I could imagine that the next couple of quarters, Q1, Q2, could remain elevated, but I can also \u2013 and my own expectation is that it would begin to sort of ameliorate towards the second half of the year and into 2025. You shouldn\u2019t be surprised if it were in line with 2023 as sort of a baseline expectation, and in an ideal world, it might be a little bit better than 2023. We will publish a revised stress scenario in our annual report. I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably deteriorated a little bit given the circumstances we see in the marketplace. And as you can see, cumulatively, we\u2019re tracking closer to the level that we\u2019d laid out in our Q2 and Q3 reporting. That said, and I think it\u2019s important to say, as you think about our forward guidance, if you take out the \u20ac450 million across the various portfolios that we booked in commercial real estate in 2023 and take that out of the numbers, you can see a CLP level that is running actually in a relatively normalized range. And that\u2019s in a year in which we actually incurred some losses, particularly in the Private Bank that went beyond what we would normally see in the Private Bank. You recall a couple of idiosyncratic cases in the first quarter and then in the third and fourth quarter some amount of, what I call, excess provisioning associated with the operational backlog issue. So we think that all gives us confidence that as this cycle in commercial real estate abates over the next six quarters, you should see a much more normalized credit loss provision emerge.\nNicolas Payen: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question\u2026\nChristian Sewing: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Anke Reingen from RBC. Please go ahead.\nAnke Reingen: Thank you very much for taking my question. Just two small number of questions. The first is just to clarify, the payment from the resolution fund, which you didn\u2019t get in Q4. That\u2019s not included in any of your commentary about costs 2024, 2025, and maybe you can give us a bit of an indication about the magnitude. And then lastly, sorry, just the numbers question. Given the many moving parts, can you help us a bit with your tax rate guidance? Thank you.\nChristian Sewing: Anke, thank you for your question. Yes, we \u2013 on the [indiscernible], that's the German word for the payment from the German resolution fund. We clearly expected the repayment into the banks because we feel from a legal analysis that this is our money. We also made various proposals to the German government together, by the way, with all banks, the saving banks, the cooperative banks, and the private banks, how we actually can use that money nicely in order to fund the transformation in Germany. It seems to be that the German government is going another route and obviously we need to review that from all kind of perspectives, as you can imagine. But to your clear question for the guidance of 2024 and 2025, this is not part of our plan, i.e. there is no cost plan where this is included because for the time being we assume that this is not coming our way. But of course, we need to review it from a legal point of view.\nJames von Moltke: Or capital plan for that matter. And then tax, I would use a 30% rate in your modeling for 2024. Obviously, always uncertainties and things that can change. One thing that we are now at the end of is the DTA valuation adjustments. We've essentially written back the tax attributes in actually three jurisdictions now, the United States, the UK, and Italy, and therefore where you should see a normalized level of taxation in the coming periods.\nAnke Reingen: Thank you very much.\nJames von Moltke: Thank you, Anke.\nOperator: Next question comes from Giulia Aurora from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nGiulia Aurora: Hi, good morning, and thank you for all the new disclosure, in particular on NII and costs. I want to ask you, however, a question on capital. Specifically, there have been some headlines on potential M&A, which is something that you also looked at domestic M&A few years ago, but that seems to be at odds [ph] with what we hear today, your big commitment to capital distribution. So how do we square these two, and what would take you to pursue some big M&A? That's the first question. And then the second question is more of a numbers question. Sorry. Going back to the costs again, I hear a lot of conviction on \u20ac20 billion by 2025 underlying and one-offs reducing. So what is a sort of run rate for restructuring costs? Do you expect it to be \u20ac400 million in 2024 and then down to \u20ac200 million? And, yes any similar comment on other potential one-offs? Thanks.\nJames von Moltke: Well, let me start. I'll have a quick thing to say. Yes, it is at odds, and what you hear from us is a commitment to distribution. And on costs it's hard to say with perfect accuracy what it is that these litigation and restructuring severance, obviously the latter is more in our control. If I look to 2025, I think \u20ac400 million collectively for the two would be a reasonable kind of planning assumption, and we'd like to do better than that. Clearly, one of the things that we're working to do is put the remaining restructuring items behind us now in 2024, I've given you an estimate of what that looks like. And as I said earlier, one does looking at our litigation sort of portfolio, one does feel that it's changing in terms of kind of number and size of events. Now, it's never a perfect forecast, but it's certainly something that we're hoping to work down to a more normalized level. So, I'll give you \u20ac300 million to \u20ac400 million is probably a good planning assumption across the two.\nChristian Sewing: Giulia, I just want to emphasize that what James said on the M&A, there is nothing we can do about headlines. We focus on ourselves, and distribution to shareholders is, at the heart what we are doing.\nGiulia Aurora: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jeremy Sigee from BNP. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you. Just a couple of number detail things, please. Firstly, on the capital returns, can I just clarify what has been deducted from capital already is it the \u20ac0.45 and the \u20ac675 million, buyback but no extra have those both been deducted, and linked to that is the constraint when you talk about the 50% payout for the returns done over the course of this year, and in particular in the second half of this year, is the constraint 50% of this year's earnings, 2024, or constraint being 50% of last year's earnings, which a lot of it was accrued out of. And then the last question was just on the costs, I know we've talked a lot about it, but in the divisions, both the IB and the Corporate Bank were about \u20ac100 million heavier in the quarter, and I wasn't very clear. I wonder if you could just talk a bit more about how much of that was specific items or sort of year end extra, and how much of that falls away. That'd be very helpful. Thank you.\nJames von Moltke: Sure. Jeremy, I think I got both of your questions, but feel free to follow up. Look, we would like to stick to the 50%. We think that's prudent and ideally not go beyond. By putting out the dividend guidance that we have, I think the indication is management is confident of its ability to grow earnings from here. If you think about 50% of our net income to common for 2023, that actually gives us still a fair amount of room against the \u20ac1.6 billion that we've talked about today. To your question about what is, if you like, disregarded in the ratio based on interim profit recognition, the answer is the \u20ac900 million, the 45 cents [ph] is disregarded in the December ratio, the \u20ac675 million is not removed from that. The \u20ac675 million we see as part of a discretionary program rather than the 50% payout ratio assumption, which in essence wasn't in place for 2020 \u2013 in respect of 2023. That \u20ac675 million would represent about 20 basis points. And so in the rounding, we'd be at 13.5, maybe 13.6 pro forma for that second buyback. In IB and CB costs, I do want to just remind that CB took the lion's share of the FDIC assessment, so there's noise this quarter on that, as well as last year in the fourth quarter, there was a \u2013 what I'll call a true up in the internal service cost allocation. So that's been a bigger feature in for CB than the others. And in IB, of course, we\u2019ve \u2013 that's seen a fair amount of the investment in 2023, including, obviously, Numis in the fourth quarter. So noise in both. And as we strip away now in Q1, you should see what I'll call as a cleaner run rate in both of those businesses.\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you. And just to be clear, both of those things are in the adjusted costs. So the FDIC is in the adjusted costs. It's not been stripped out as one off.\nJames von Moltke: Yes. FDIC was not stripped out as one off.\nJeremy Sigee: Okay.\nJames von Moltke: So the only thing that is, of all of that, the only thing that's not in adjusted cost is the Numis impairment.\nJeremy Sigee: Perfect. Thank you very much indeed. Appreciate it.\nJames von Moltke: Thank you, Jeremy.\nOperator: Next question is from Andrew Coombs from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Coombs: Good morning. Two questions, please. Firstly, thank you for the net interest income walk. In the guidance for the decline that you gave for 2024, you talked about moving to a steady state level on deposit pricing. Perhaps you could just elaborate there on what your steady state deposit beta assumption is? I think your peers are at 40%, but perhaps you could elaborate there? Secondly, coming back to the non-net interest income growth, it looks like you're targeting \u20ac1.6 billion a year in both 2024 and 2025, 9% to 10%. It's a very healthy run rate that you're guiding to. Within that, you've mentioned the four different components. So fixed income, origination & advisory, wealth and asset management. And you said that origination & advisory is the biggest component within that. But perhaps I could ask two things. Number one, can you split out the growth between those four? And secondly, how much of it is driven by industry wallet versus how much is market share gains? Thank you.\nChristian Sewing: So I'll speak to the beta. Look, we sort of made a policy decision, if you like, not to talk about betas in specific terms externally. What we have seen, and I think we've talked about this before, our portfolios are quite varied. And by that I mean the deposit portfolio breaks out between private bank and corporate bank. And then in each of those businesses, really euros and dollars. And then, of course, there's a dynamic around what is site and what is term. So there's different sort of behaviors across those things. What we are thinking could happen is that with the expectation of the market now, that policy rates will start to go down, that the long-term interest rates have gone down. You may see a peak in terms of pass through, or we may have in fact seen a peak in terms of pass through, because now banks are reacting and our clients are reacting to a changed interest rate environment. And hence we could \u2013 can't say this was certainly, but we could be near a peak of the pass through associated with the rate increase cycle we've just been through. And now the question will flip to how sticky will customer rates be on the way down? So a completely different dynamic.  As I've said, our \u2013 and we said this in Q3, and I guess I'd reiterate this, our beta assumptions assume a continued convergence towards the models as though the trend was still upwards, although there's a possibility, as I say, that we've peaked and may run flat for a period of time before things start to move down. So an interesting dynamic around the betas. In terms of the split, I don't want to go into too much detail, but I would say relatively evenly split between private bank, corporate bank and the fixed income and currencies business. So producing, let's just say about half of the rise, if I would put it in rough terms and about the other half in O&A. And as I've mentioned, we see O&A as a recovery rather than a growth from a, kind of a steady state level and in that number you might see two-thirds of it be the market and a third be market share. But again, those are very rough estimates that we're sort of looking at in our planning. Lots of things can move, but I hope what you take away from that is how broad based the sources that we're looking at are. And as we've talked about, much of the revenue base becoming predictable around input drivers and output revenues that it produces alongside as we show you now a relatively predictable net interest income stream, including incidentally the breakout now of what we're calling the banking book businesses, which include the financing in FIC. So hopefully that's some good color on what we're seeing and is driving the raised guidance.\nAndrew Coombs: It's helpful, thank you.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you. Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Next question is from Andrew Lim [Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]. Please go ahead with your question.\nAndrew Lim: Hi, morning. Thanks for taking my question. So firstly, on that non-NII guidance that you've lifted, it does seem a large part of that is based on self help and investments, but I guess some part also based on market growth. So I guess my question here is what's your assumption for GDP growth backing your guidance here and in particular for Germany? And then my second question is back on your cost guidance you're guiding to \u20ac5 billion for 1Q and I guess about \u20ac20 billion for the year. But typically you've had about \u20ac5.3 billion, \u20ac5.4 billion for the 1Q and then a bit less than \u20ac5 billion for the remaining quarters to reflect the seasonality of stronger revenues in the first quarter. So just wondering how you're thinking about that now? What's happening with the seasonality through the year?\nChristian Sewing: Yes. So, Andrew, thanks for the questions. So the bigger driver of the Q1 numbers has been the bank levy and we've had to go through the adjustment sort of hoops on that. And we think it was still to be finalized and determined, but we think that noise will be removed. And also, ironically we've had to book some bank levy in Q4 because of the way the dynamic works between the UK and the European bank levies. So in a sense brought forward some bank levy from 2024 into 2023. You're right that there is some seasonality, especially with variable compensation bookings, but on a relative basis to a big number like \u20ac5 billion, that is not a massive driver. But something we look at and manage carefully, given the importance of it to our business. On the assumptions of GDP growth, we just use a consensus view. And that consensus view obviously already reflects pretty muted GDP growth performance, especially in Germany. So zero, slightly negative, relatively muted in Europe, but in the United States and Asia, probably assumptions that right now are a little bit behind what the consensus views. To be fair, GDP isn't necessarily the main driver of the engines that we're talking about of the fee and commission income growth, I'd say it's more activity. And by activity I mean loan fees on trade finance, which has been relatively muted. I mean transactions in terms of issuance where we also in our Trust and Agency and Securities get business, get fees on custody and also transfer agency and the like. So it is activity levels that really are the driver and they cohere more just with corporate and household confidence than specifically GDP growth assumptions.\nAndrew Lim: Many thanks for that.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Next question is from Mate Nemes from UBS. Please go ahead.\nMate Nemes: Thank you, and well-done on the results today. A couple of questions from my side. First, as a follow-up, you mentioned that the non-NII revenue growth could be perhaps coming maybe two-thirds from market growth and one-third from market share growth. Looking at this and the \u20ac32 billion implied revenue target by 2025, could you give us a sense what degree of flexibility do you see on the cost side? Should perhaps some disappointment happen? Maybe from the market growth side, what levers do you have to pull? Should there be a disappointment on revenues? Because clearly you are doing a lot to hit that \u20ac20 billion adjusted cost target. That\u2019s the first question. The second one is on capital management and specifically M&A. I think we\u2019ve heard you loud and clear that you\u2019re focused on distribution mainly, but you\u2019re also looking at perhaps accelerating growth in some areas and investing in the divisions. Do you see scope for perhaps bolt-on acquisitions along the lines of Numis here and there? And if that\u2019s the case, where do you see opportunities? You can accelerate the organic growth and what would be your criteria? Thank you.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you. Let me start with the last one. One cannot exclude that. And if there is an opportunity in one of our core businesses that we have an add-on acquisition, which makes sense from a content point of view, from a regional point of view, from a client point of view, and it fits into our culture, I wouldn\u2019t exclude that. But it\u2019s not the main focus of our strategy. And when we came to the previous questions and the headlines, I was referring to in particular the bigger M&A\u2019s, which is not our priority. But if we would have an opportunity, I would always say we would potentially look at it. But again, we feel that with the existing platform we have, with the existing franchise we have, we are really on a good path to achieve the goals be it on the revenue side or on the cost side. I like your questions on the cost side with regard to the flexibility. Yes, we have clearly an ambitious road on the non-NII, but I can see already how in particular in the O&A business, our investments, both in Numis by the way, which is running really well, but also the hiring of the people, which we have done, is adding in terms of mandates and also revenues. Also when I look now at Q1, but clearly if it\u2019s not coming, we have a dynamic process. And that dynamic process is that the business has to explain to the CFO, but also to me what they are doing if the revenues are not coming through. Now, to be very honest, we build it for the long term. And I think it\u2019s the right decision for us to expand in that business. But clearly if revenues would lag, then obviously you have various levers, be it in that area also variable comp. We have other investments, which are part of our plan for those business, which we can reduce in this regard we would proactively, obviously countermeasure.\nJames von Moltke: And Mate, just a couple of things. I may have just clean up a statement of the market share versus market growth. First of all, the focus there was on origination advisory, and I may have inverted what I meant to say is two-thirds we think comes from market and one-third from market share growth. But again, those are estimates. I guess the one other thing just to point out on your capital question, Slide 17 of the deck, what we tried to indicate is in the last 25% block there of how we would apply the capital is sort of stuff. It is whatever we\u2019re not able to offset of CRR3 through our capital management measures, then either ratio build more distribution would be built into that and also some leeway to pursue bolt-on acquisitions or have the capital impact of bolt-on acquisitions if we find the right opportunities. We\u2019ve talked in the past what those opportunities typically look like, we\u2019ve been clear that DWS, the asset management business, has been seeking opportunities and we would put capital to work there. We\u2019ve looked at other opportunities over time. But I guess the thing to point to is just we would be disciplined about targeting investment opportunities that are, relatively speaking, capital light and strategically on point, as Numis was with our Global Hausbank strategy.\nMate Nemes: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nJames von Moltke: Thank you.\nOperator: That was our last question for today, which concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the conference back to Ioana for any closing comments.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you. And thank you for joining us today and for your questions. If you have any further questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact the Investor Relations team. And with that, we look forward to speaking to you at our first quarter results.",

        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Thank you, Ioana, and a warm welcome from me. It's a pleasure to be discussing our results with you today. We have set Deutsche Bank's course for sustainable growth and returns for shareholders through our Global Hausbank strategy and 2023 saw clear progress. We delivered business growth, as the benefits of our sharpened business model came through. We grew revenues to around \u20ac29 billion with a growth rate of close to 7% per year since 2021, well above our initial target, and we are now raising our revenue growth target to 5.5% to 6.5%, with the aim of reaching revenues of around \u20ac32 billion by 2025. We made conscious investment decisions to protect and grow our franchise by driving business growth, strengthening controls and improving operational efficiency.We have now reached an inflection point on costs; our investments are approaching completion, and we are making solid progress on our efficiency program. As a result, we now see ourselves delivering normalized operating and financial performance. This reinforces our confidence that we will deliver on our target run rate of around \u20ac5 billion per quarter for adjusted costs, including the first quarter of this year. Our guidance for the full year 2025 non-interest rate expenses remains unchanged, at around \u20ac20 billion. We again demonstrated our resilience, with high-quality risk management and our strong capital and balance sheet. All of this leaves us highly confident that we will meet our 2025 financial targets. Furthermore, we are increasing our capital distributions, as rewarding our shareholders is our priority. We increased both dividends and share buybacks by 50% compared to 2022. We plan to propose a dividend of $0.45 per share at the AGM, approximately \u20ac900 million in total, for the financial year 2023; and we have regulatory approval for a further \u20ac675 million in share buybacks, which we intend to complete in the first half of 2024. And our raised capital outlook, which we outlined last quarter, has created scope to accelerate and expand distributions further. We now expect to significantly outperform our original \u20ac8 billion target for the financial years 2021 through 2025; and we would consider proposing a dividend of \u20ac1 per share in respect of 2025, subject to our 50% payout ratio. Let\u2019s first discuss business growth, starting with our 2023 revenue performance on Slide 2. We delivered sustained growth and improved quality of earnings streams with a well-balanced business mix. Revenues were in line with our guidance, at around \u20ac29 billion, up 6% year-on-year. 78% of our revenues came from recurring earnings streams, up from 71% in 2020. We benefitted from rising interest rates, notably in the Corporate Bank and Private Bank. We also focused on building out our fee business across all businesses and here let me give you a few examples. In the Corporate Bank, we developed innovative products, hired relationship managers in strategic areas, and deepened relationships with key clients. This was already evidenced by the growth in fee income in the fourth quarter. We also added senior bankers in client-facing areas in International Private Bank and the Investment Bank, and completed the acquisition of Numis. We attracted net inflows of \u20ac57 billion across the Private Bank and Asset Management, which helped to grow Assets under Management by \u20ac115 billion, to \u20ac1.5 trillion. Our progress in strengthening our franchise has been recognized with upgrades from the leading rating agencies, which further positions us well to deepen engagement with current and new clients. Now let\u2019s look ahead at our revenue pathway to 2025 on Slide 3. Since 2021, we have demonstrated revenue momentum well ahead of our original target growth rate, due in part to a supportive interest rate environment. We are confident that as interest rates normalize, we can maintain a solid revenue trajectory. And this is supported by the expected growth in noninterest income, which already accounts for more than half of Group revenues, and our investments in capital light activities. Based on this, we are raising our revenue target from between 3.5% and 4.5% to between 5.5% and 6.5%, for the period 2021 through 2025, aiming to reach around \u20ac32 billion in 2025. We expect non-interest income growth to contribute approximately 2.5 percentage points to the targeted compound annual growth between 2021 and 2025. And this is achievable through a number of levers: growing share of wallet in the Corporate Bank; reaping the benefits of investments in Origination & Advisory; building on our recent strong relative performance in our FIC business; expanding fee-generating businesses in the Private Bank; benefitting from investments and growing capital-light lending businesses; delivering on our growth strategies, including Passive; and taking full advantage of market recovery, in Asset Management. Additionally, across both the Private Bank and Asset Management, we aim to convert 2023\u2019s net inflows and growth in assets under management into revenues.  In respect of net interest income growth, we expect it to contribute approximately four percentage points to the targeted compound annual growth between 2021 and 2025. This reflects a normalization in 2024, followed by further growth in 2025 and beyond, and James will expand on this shortly. Let me now take you through additional details on how we plan to grow non-interest revenues on Slide 4. In the Corporate Bank, we already have stable sources of fee income from our payments business, trade finance offering, custody business as well as trust and agency services. We have invested into our payment platforms and enhancing sector-specific coverage teams. In terms of products, we also continue our investments into fee generating Merchant Solutions and Digital Asset Custody to support future fee growth. We are accelerating the cross-divisional solution offering, for example, FX, hedging and risk management products, and we are helping corporates with their sustainability transition. In the Investment Bank, we have one of the leading FIC platforms, with around 35% of revenues coming from our Financing business. We have consistently said that we aim to grow Financing and FIC trading activities by developing the existing businesses, growing our Americas footprint and increasing client penetration. In O&A, revenues saw a low point in 2022; we expect fees to be driven, this year and next, by some market recovery combined with the benefits of our investments. We hired strategically across many sectors and acquired Numis to create a leading position in the UK. All this will help us to deepen and broaden our client relationships and further develop our ESG capabilities. In the Private Bank we aim to grow revenues from investment products at around 10% per year over the next years. We are confident we can achieve this, given our strong asset generation, investments in hiring in the international franchise, and enhancement of digital channels. We will also expand our Lombard lending business in Wealth Management and the Bank for Entrepreneurs. In addition to our focus on Germany, we are intensifying our business development in growing markets such as Asia and the Middle East. In Asset Management, to give you a few examples on our growth initiatives. We are building on Xtrackers momentum via product innovation and we are expanding internationally. Within Alternatives, we want to focus on Credit in Europe and Real Estate Debt in the U.S., and we will be strengthening fixed income and multi asset capabilities to increase potential for scaling up. And I\u2019m encouraged by the start we\u2019ve had in January so far, with revenue performance that supports this trajectory. Now let me turn to operating efficiency on Slide 5. Our 2023 cost base was impacted by inflation, business growth and investments to accelerate execution of our Global Hausbank strategy on three dimensions, improving operational efficiency, growing sustainable revenues, and strengthening our control environment. About \u20ac400 million of these additional investments are nonrecurring and mainly related to improvements of our operational efficiency, severance charges for targeted reductions in senior non-client facing roles and real estate one-offs. We also recognized an impairment of goodwill related to Numis. Some of these non-recurring items arose in the fourth quarter, alongside other exceptional items which James will discuss shortly. We also made business investments of \u20ac200 million which will remain in our run-rate. We saw incremental savings of around \u20ac340 million from our operational efficiency measures this year. These will more than offset the run-rate impact of the investments, which reflects our approach of self-funding our investments. On business growth, we have invested in capital-light businesses, as we just discussed. On controls, we further strengthened key functions with the addition of around 1,000 dedicated professionals across all regions to ensure thought leadership and increased dedicated spending to around \u20ac1.2 billion in 2023. Our investments over the years have materially improved our controls. For example, we have built automated tools into our KYC controls, to dynamically review client activity and tighten quality control standards. We have significantly upgraded our core control applications, for example, we successfully migrated our Euro clearing business onto a new strategic transaction monitoring platform. We made material strides in re-engineering processes front-to-back and the progress so far has made our bank safer. As our remediation work across key regulatory programs is anticipated to approach completion, we expect our focus during 2024 to gradually shift from remediation to a sustainable business as usual risk management. We also continued to put longstanding legal matters behind us in 2023, and we expect to see the benefits of our improved operating model coming through from 2024. We believe these investments will positively impact operating leverage, by boosting revenue growth while keeping costs essentially stable to 2022 levels, as we set out on Slide 6. We see a clear path to costs of approximately \u20ac20 billion in 2025. Over the next two years, our aim is to drive reductions across both non-operating costs and our adjusted cost base, by managing our run rate and driving efficiency measures. We foresee reductions in non-operating costs of around \u20ac700 million from 2023 levels in the next two years. The \u20ac233 million impairment of goodwill relating to Numis is now behind us, and we see restructuring and severance charges coming down by around \u20ac400 million from 2023 levels. On adjusted costs, as we have already communicated, we see bank levies coming down by between \u20ac350 million and \u20ac400 million over the next two years. The additional \u20ac400 million net reduction will come from further progress on our operational efficiency program, so let me give you some additional detail on where we stand with our \u20ac2.5 billion efficiency measures. We have already executed on measures with delivered or expected savings of \u20ac1.3 billion, of which around \u20ac900 million of savings were realized to date. The residual savings of \u20ac1.6 billion are as follows: on Germany optimization, we anticipate savings of around \u20ac600 million, reflecting our strategic ambition to increase profitability in our core home market. On technology and infrastructure, we anticipate roughly \u20ac700 million of savings from a number of items, including application decommissioning and other operating model improvements. And finally, on front-to-back process re-design, we anticipate about \u20ac300 million from simplified workflows and automation. Included in these measures is the reduction of 3,500 roles, mainly in non-client facing areas. The vast majority of these measures will be in our 2025 run-rate. With that, we have material capacity to more than offset inflation and the impact from our business growth plans. Our detailed implementation roadmap gives us confidence in delivering non-interest expenses of approximately \u20ac20 billion in 2025, giving us a clear pathway to our cost/income ratio target of 62.5%. We\u2019re conscious that we\u2019re operating in a fast-changing environment. Our path towards 2025 may be impacted by external factors, and we have taken this into account. We have the toolkit in place to implement additional measures which would enable us to further flex our cost base to meet our cost/income ratio target, even if we see unforeseen revenue headwinds. Now let me turn to capital, liquidity and risk management on Slide 7. In 2023, we proved our resilience in a challenging environment. We demonstrated first-class risk management, with a high-quality and well-diversified loan book, supported by multiple risk mitigants. Our provision for credit losses was 31 basis points of average loans, marginally above guidance range and also reflecting overlay changes applied in the fourth quarter. Liquidity has remained very robust, and with substantial buffers above required levels. In addition, our balance sheet is strong. We have a large and healthy diversified deposit base, mainly in our domestic market. Furthermore, we demonstrated strong capital management; we ended the year with a robust CET1 ratio, at 13.7%. Now let me turn to our plans for distributions to shareholders on Slide 8. Our strong organic capital generation and disciplined capital management, allowed us both to digest the significant regulatory inflation of the last two years, and support our business growth, while still being in a position to distribute around 30% of our net income to shareholders. Consistent with prior guidance, we now see scope to shift gears on capital distributions and to increase shareholder distributions to 50% of net income to shareholders from the full year 2024. In October, we set out plans to accelerate and expand our distributions, having raised our capital outlook by around \u20ac3 billion through 2025. With the distributions announced today and our positive capital outlook, we are on track to significantly outperform against our original distribution target. Let me conclude with a few words on our strategy, on Slide 9. We have seen rising uncertainties, in the global economy and across the geopolitical landscape, since we launched our Global Hausbank strategy early in 2022. These developments prove that our strategy is the right one for our clients and for Deutsche Bank. We have seen, more than ever, that clients want and need a partner with the expertise, product breadth and global network to help them navigate a more uncertain environment. A European partner, capable of helping and advising them across the world. The progress we have made, on all key dimensions, gives us a clear path to our 2025 targets. Having sharpened our business model, we have raised our revenue targets and made focused investments to boost revenues further, especially all in capital light businesses and we\u2019re seizing the opportunities offered by our technology investments to expand our digital offering to clients. We have already completed operational efficiency measures, which take us around halfway towards our \u20ac2.5 billion target. And we\u2019re well positioned to increase our goals for capital distributions to shareholders through 2025. With that, let me hand over to James."

        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Thank you, Christian. Let me start with a few key performance indicators on Slide 11, and place them in the context of our 2025 targets. Christian outlined our business momentum and well-balanced revenue mix, which resulted in revenue growth of 6.6% on a compound basis for the last two years, relative to 2021. This performance puts us well on track to deliver revenue growth in line with our new target. Our strong franchise growth led to a 10 percentage point improvement in the cost/income ratio to 75% against 2021, with the last two years being pivotal investment years. Our return on tangible equity was 7.4% in the full year of 2023, including a benefit from deferred tax asset valuation. Our capital position remained strong with the CET1 ratio at 13.7% at year-end after absorbing regulatory headwinds. Our liquidity metrics also remained strong; LCR was 140%, above our target of around 130%, and the net stable funding ratio was 122%. In short, our performance in the period reaffirms our resilience and our confidence in reaching our 2025 targets. With that, let me turn to the fourth quarter highlights on Slide 12. Group revenues were \u20ac6.7 billion, up 5% on the fourth quarter of 2022 or 10% excluding specific items. Non-interest expenses were \u20ac5.5 billion, up 5% year-on-year. Non-operating expenses were down by 45% compared to the prior year period, mainly reflecting a release of litigation provisions. At the same time, we booked items related to strategy execution, including the impairments of goodwill and other intangibles of around \u20ac230 million, and restructuring and severance provisions of nearly \u20ac200 million. We generated a profit before tax of \u20ac698 million, down 10% year-on-year, which mainly reflects the increase in adjusted costs and the non-repeat of the gain on the sale reported in the prior year quarter. Net profit of \u20ac1.4 billion was down 28% year-on-year, reflecting a lower DTA valuation adjustment compared to the prior year quarter. Our cost/income ratio was 82% and our post-tax return on average tangible common equity was 8.8% in the quarter. Diluted earnings per share was \u20ac0.67 in the fourth quarter and tangible book value per share was \u20ac28.41, up 6% year-on-year. Let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results. Let me start with a review of our net interest income on Slide 13, which also provides an outlook for the next two years. The numbers are based on market expectations for interest rates as of 26th January this year. Our reported net interest income of \u20ac13.6 billion was broadly stable for the group in 2023 compared to the prior year, but that does not reflect the economic contribution to group revenues due to significant moves in accounting effects, which are offset in non-interest revenues. Focusing on our three key NII generating business units, as well as other funding costs not offset by accounting effects, we see an improvement of just over \u20ac2 billion and a cumulative benefit since 2021 of over \u20ac4 billion. Looking ahead on the same basis, we expect a decline of around \u20ac600 million in 2024, driven by the convergence of betas to steady state levels. We expect this to be followed by an increase of around \u20ac400 million in 2025, which brings us close to 2023 NII levels, as the beta convergence is largely offset by the rollover of our hedge portfolios as well as balance sheet growth. In line with prior guidance, we expect a larger sequential reduction in the Corporate Bank than in the Private Bank in 2024. We expect a sequential improvement excluding accounting asymmetries in the Corporate & Other division of around \u20ac300 million relating to reduced funding costs for corporate assets and lower retained liquidity and other funding costs. We prepared additional slides on NII which are in appendix but the key messages I want to highlight are that: We have around \u20ac230 billion of long-term interest rate hedges on our deposits and equity. The majority of these hedges are entered into with a 10-year tenor and the weighted average maturity of the portfolio is four to five years. We expect \u20ac2.5 billion of NII from interest rate hedges in 2024, of which more than 90% is locked in with existing positions. Once deposit betas have converged to steady state levels, our NII sensitivity will mostly be to long-term rates, as our hedge portfolio rolls over with limited sensitivity to short-term rates unless moves are sharp enough to re-introduce beta lags or approach the zero bound. We may outperform this guidance if market expectations regarding rate cuts do not fully materialize or deposit betas increase more slowly than expected. With that, let\u2019s turn to adjusted cost development, on Slide 14. First, our guidance for full year 2023 adjusted costs was essentially flat compared to 2022, as we absorbed the impacts from inflation, ongoing investments and business growth, which Christian discussed earlier. We made it clear that this guidance included an expectation that the German banking industry would receive a restitution payment from a national resolution fund in the fourth quarter. And as we announced in our pre-close document, this payment was not included in the recently announced budget. While our full year adjusted costs were up 3% year-on-year, in line with our guidance, the fourth quarter adjusted costs of \u20ac5.3 billion were up 9% year-on-year, higher than the initial expectations. We had around \u20ac210 million of exceptional items in the fourth quarter resulting in adjusted costs excluding bank levies of \u20ac5.26 billion. About \u20ac90 million of these exceptional items are not expected to repeat in the following quarters. About \u20ac35 million of costs related to Private Bank service remediation are expected to taper off over time and around \u20ac80 million of other costs should normalize. Reflecting on the nature of these exceptional items and considering savings coming through from efficiency measures, we expect to return to a run-rate of around \u20ac5 billion in the first quarter of this year. Let\u2019s now turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 15. Provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter was \u20ac488 million, equivalent to 41 basis points of average loans. The quarter-on-quarter development in Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions of \u20ac30 million mainly reflects the non-recurrence of model related adjustments in the previous quarter and the application of an overlay in this quarter. Stage 3 provisions of \u20ac457 million were also higher compared to the prior quarter as we saw elevated levels mainly in the Private Bank and Corporate Bank, partly offset by a provision reduction in the Investment Bank. Full year provisions were 31 basis points and reflect higher Stage 3 provisions related to commercial real estate in the Investment Bank and certain one-offs in the Private Bank, partly offset by lower Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions, as well as a slower-than-expected loan growth. Before we move to performance in our businesses, let me turn to capital on the next two slides, starting with Slide 16. Our fourth quarter Common Equity Tier 1 ratio came in at 13.7%, a 20 basis points decrease compared to the previous quarter. This quarter-on-quarter reduction reflect lower capital as our net income was more than offset by capital deductions, most notably for shareholder dividends, AT1 coupons and deferred tax assets. Risk weighted assets were flat over the quarter. Credit risk RWA increased over the quarter reflecting business growth and model changes. These increases were partly offset by capital optimization initiatives as we continue to focus on the capital efficiency of our balance sheet. Lower market risk and operational risk RWA more than offset higher credit risk RWA over the quarter, reflecting lower market volatility and an improved risk profile. At the end of the fourth quarter our leverage ratio was 4.5%, reflecting a lower capital position and higher leverage exposure. Building on Christian\u2019s earlier comments on the inflection point in our capital base on Slide 17. Let me give you a view how we want to manage our capital through 2025, as our profitability is improving and delivering more sustainable net income. First, in line with our ambition, we want to pay out 50% of net income to our shareholders. Second, we will aim to deploy about 25% of net income into the businesses to support further growth. Finally, we expect the remaining 25% will provide us with a buffer for additional capital use, the final implementation of CRR3 and further distributions, acquisitions or an increase in our capital ratio. Let me also give you an update on our capital efficiency program. In the fourth quarter we delivered RWA relief of a further \u20ac3 billion, mainly from additional securitizations, which brings the achieved reduction to \u20ac13 billion, and means we remain on course for our \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion target, and we aim to deliver further progress in 2024. Let me give you some more details on our intentions regarding shareholder distributions. In March 2022, we set a goal to increase dividends per share by 50% for three consecutive years, which we are on track to deliver. As the slide indicates, subject to a 50% pay-out ratio, we believe there will be scope to extend the 50% increase objective to 2025, suggesting a dividend of \u20ac1 per share could be paid in 2026. This would bring the total dividend payments over the five-year period to over \u20ac5 billion. At the same time, we are continuing to increase share buybacks. And as Christian mentioned, we will execute a further \u20ac675 million program in the first half of 2024, which is again a 50% increase on the buyback program we completed last year. Finally, given our strong capital and earnings outlook, we see significant scope for further share buybacks and therefore a clear path to outperform our original distribution target of \u20ac8 billion. Let\u2019s now turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 20. Corporate Bank revenues in the fourth quarter were \u20ac1.9 billion, 9% higher compared to a prior year quarter, which already reflected the early stages of the interest rate cycle. The interest rate environment remained favorable, with revenues further supported by the continued pricing discipline, a solid deposit base and higher commission and fee income. Sequentially, revenues increased slightly, driven by higher net interest income from higher average balances with corporate and institutional clients and higher commission and fee income in our Institutional Client Services business. We continue to anticipate a normalization of our deposit revenues over the coming quarters which we expect to be partially offset by growing non-interest-rate-sensitive revenue streams. Loan volume in the Corporate Bank declined by \u20ac5 billion compared to the prior year quarter and remained stable sequentially, compensating for the impact of FX movements. Deposits were \u20ac289 billion, \u20ac3 billion higher than in the third quarter with an increased share of term deposit balances compared to the prior year. Provision for credit losses was 26 basis points of average loans. The moderate increase versus the prior year was driven by higher Stage 3 provisions across various portfolios. Noninterest expenses significantly increased year on year, driven by the FDIC special assessment charge in the current quarter and adjustments to the internal service cost allocations in the prior year quarter. This resulted in a post-tax return on tangible equity of 15% and a cost/income ratio of 60%. I\u2019ll now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 21. Revenues for the fourth quarter were 10% higher year on year on a reported basis and 8% higher excluding specific items. Revenues in FIC Sales & Trading increased by 1% versus an already strong prior year quarter and represented the highest fourth quarter revenues since 2010. Credit Trading revenues were significantly higher driven by continued strong performance in Distressed and ongoing improvements in the Flow business. The performance of Flow reflects the successful execution of our strategic initiatives and the investments made through 2023. Emerging Markets revenues were also significantly higher driven by increased client activity in Asia. Financing revenues were slightly lower versus the prior year quarter, but essentially flat on a full year basis. Rates and Foreign Exchange revenues were both significantly lower when compared to a very strong prior year quarter and reflected an overall decline in market activity and volatility. Moving to Origination & Advisory, revenues were up 56% when compared to the prior year quarter but down slightly sequentially due to deal slippage into the first quarter of 2024. Debt origination revenues were significantly higher benefitting from an improved LDCM performance, including the non-repeat of hedge losses in the prior year quarter. The leveraged loan market saw a partial recovery from a market that was largely inactive in the prior year. Advisory revenues were slightly lower compared to the prior year period. However, we expect the previously communicated investments into targeted sectors and regions during 2023 to drive improved performance this year against an improving industry backdrop. Non-interest expenses were significantly higher year-on-year, largely the result of a one-off impairment of goodwill related to our investment in the acquisition of Numis. Adjusted costs were slightly higher reflecting targeted investments in Origination & Advisory, which includes the Numis acquisition. Leverage exposure, risk-weighted assets and loans were all broadly stable year-on-year. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac186 million or 73 basis points of average loans. The increase versus the prior year quarter was primarily driven by the model impact on Stage 1 and 2 performing loans, with Stage 3 impairments also higher and primarily driven by Commercial Real Estate. Turning to the Private Bank on Slide 22. Private Bank revenues were \u20ac2.4 billion in the quarter, up 9% year-on-year if adjusted for the gain on sale of around \u20ac310 million related to the Financials Advisors business in Italy last year. Private Bank Germany revenues increased by 10% year-on-year mainly driven by interest income, reflecting strong deposit margins. In the International Private Bank revenues were up 9% year-on-year if adjusted for specific items and FX movements. The growth was driven by episodic revenues in lending, and higher deposit revenues across Europe and Middle East, which were partially offset by continued muted capital market activity and client deleveraging in APAC. Turning to costs, non-interest expenses were significantly higher year-on-year driven by approximately \u20ac100 million of restructuring and severance costs as well as investments in strategic initiatives, Postbank service remediation costs and inflation. These were partly mitigated by continued savings from transformation programs and lower internal cost allocations. Fourth quarter provisions for credit losses of 30 basis points of average loans continue to reflect temporary effects caused by the operational backlog. The development of the overall portfolio continuously reflects the high quality of the loan book, especially in the retail businesses, and ongoing tight risk discipline. The business attracted strong net inflow into asset under management of \u20ac7 billion mainly in deposits. Let me continue with Asset Management on Slide 23. My usual reminder, the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Assets under management increased to \u20ac896 billion in the quarter, supported by net inflows and positive market appreciation of \u20ac40 billion, partly offset by negative FX effects. Net inflows of \u20ac11 billion were primarily in Passive once again, continuing the positive momentum we have seen throughout the year, as well as in Cash products. Revenues declined by 5% versus the prior year. This was primarily the result of a decline in management fees to \u20ac575 million. Other revenues declined due to lower investment income and higher funding charges. Compensation and benefits costs were higher mainly driven by a change in accounting treatment related to carried interest in the prior year quarter, partly offset by lower other variable compensation. Non-compensation costs were also higher, reflecting support for transformation and costs related to growth in assets under management. In the prior year period non-operating costs included a significant impairment charge for an unamortized intangible asset which is not repeated this year. Profit before tax is significantly lower than the prior year period, mainly impacted by lower revenues. The cost/income ratio for the quarter was 81% and return on tangible equity was 7.1%. Moving to Corporate & Other on Slide 24. Corporate & Other reported a pre-tax loss of \u20ac14 million this quarter, versus the equivalent pre-tax loss of \u20ac535 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This improvement was primarily driven by a net litigation release of \u20ac287 million in this quarter. Valuation and timing differences were positive \u20ac142 million compared to \u20ac48 million in the prior year quarter, in part driven by the reversal of prior year losses. The pre-tax profit associated with legacy portfolios was \u20ac75 million, primarily reflecting the aforementioned litigation release. Funding and liquidity impacts were negative \u20ac111 million in the quarter, bringing the full year in line with our guidance. Expenses associated with shareholder activities were \u20ac147 million in the quarter which we see as the new quarterly run rate. At the end of the fourth quarter, risk weighted assets were \u20ac40 billion, including \u20ac19 billion of operational risk RWA, and leverage exposure was \u20ac39 billion. For the full year, the loss before tax in C&O was \u20ac553 million.  Looking into 2024, we expect the pre-tax loss for Corporate and Other to be more negative, given the non-repeat of the aforementioned litigation release. As usual this includes some uncertainty, particularly associated with Valuation and Timing differences. Turning to the Group outlook on Slide 25. As Christian and I have outlined, we are increasingly confident in our growth path, particularly in our ambitions to grow fee income across divisions. We have revised our revenue growth target to 5.5% to 6.5% over the 2021 to 2025 period, supported by investments across all business areas and a more favorable economic and market backdrop. We are fully focused on delivering our cost plan and we see our noninterest expenses reducing due to the non-repeat of certain nonoperating costs, as well as management actions to maintain our targeted quarterly run-rate of \u20ac5 billion of adjusted costs. We expect provisions for credit losses to remain at around 25 to 30 basis points of average loans in 2024. As we outlined last quarter, we have passed an inflection point in our capital management plan which supports our intention to distribute roughly half of our generated net income to shareholders, which, alongside with cost management, is our key management priority. And finally, with our first half \u20ac675 million share buyback approved, we are poised to further accelerate distributions beyond our baseline expectations. With that, let me hand back to Ioana and we look forward to your questions."

        "text": "Yes. Good morning, everybody. Just two from me. First, on distribution, looking at Slide 18, I guess if I take all those numbers together, would I be wrong in saying that the \u20ac8 billion distribution target is now about 25% higher at around \u20ac10 billion? And for this year, consensus has about \u20ac1 billion in share buybacks with respect to 2023 results. Now, you've announced \u20ac675 million and said that there is more to come. So just do you feel comfortable with the \u20ac1 billion figure that consensus has in? And then second, on costs, obviously, there was a lot of one-offs in Q4. And I guess we're going to see the \u20ac5 billion underlying from Q1, as you mentioned. But just as we start the year, what can you see in terms of one-offs for 2024 and maybe for 2025 as well?"

        "text": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning to everybody and thank you for your question. Let me start with the capital question and then James will take the cost question. Look let me go back to the Investor Day 2022 because I think it's important that \u2013 that we all understand the path which we have announced there, in particular also regard with the capital path and the \u20ac8 billion. Since then, since March 2022, we have consistently delivered on that what we have told you. And that is no different today. And our focus has always been on the execution of our strategy and the commitment actually on the one hand to focus on our clients. But, Chris, more and more what we have done in the management board of Deutsche Bank is actually to put the shareholders into the middle of focus what we are doing. Now with the investments which we have done, with the business how it develops, with the inflection point we see on regulatory remediation, taking the regulatory increases into our capital in and digesting it, we can clearly see that we are at the inflection point on our franchise, but in particular also when it comes to our capital position. And hence we can see that we have now the room to further step up. And that is then the result that we said already last year in October that we see based on the efficient capital management, the operating strengths of the business, the earnings profile, that we see \u20ac3 billion of incremental capital at our disposal. And, of course, it is our aim that a significant part of these \u20ac3 billion will be actually distributed to our shareholders. Again, also with the view that it's now the time that the shareholders go actually also into the center of what we are doing. Now what does it mean concretely? And also there, Chris, if we compare this year to last year, last year in the January earnings call, we did not actually talk about and had the approval for a share buyback. You see our confidence overall in the way the bank has done and on which way we are, and therefore we ask for the approval of the \u20ac675 million last year. We got the approval now. And that also means to your second question there on the way for 2024, in case, and I'm very confident just looking at January, in case our business performance runs as we forecasted in Q1, I think there is an opportunity and we should obviously aspire to go for a second approach this year. And that we already have the approval for the first one in January is I think a big difference to last year. Secondly, if I now look at the overall earnings capacity of the bank, how the revenues stack up, and also what James will tell you about the cost line, I really clearly can see that we can change the payout in terms of what we retain and what goes to the shareholders to a fifty-fifty. And it is clearly our goal that the 50% increase which we committed to in the last years, which we have done, is also something which we want to do going forward. Of course, subject to our earnings forecast, but again, we are highly confident. And that would mean, I mean, you mentioned the number, you know where the consensus is, that that obviously results in a number where I said, yes, I would like to actually go to consensus when it comes to share buybacks and capital distribution in total."

        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "So, and Chris, it is James. On the expense side, look, Q4 was messy. We had advertised that there were some items that we were expecting. We obviously try to give you as much of a forward look as we can. But as you can see on Page 14, there was a bunch of things that sort of tumbled out that some of which caught us by surprise. I would say as a great example, the FDIC assessment, the way it was formulated and crafted, brought basically two years' worth of assessment into the one quarter. And if I go to another question that frequently comes up on these calls, what flexibility do we have to offset? While we think that ForEx flexibility is greater than it has been in the past, \u20ac50 million coming out of nowhere in late November, early December is not something you can really offset at that point in time. But your question is what comfort can we give you that the one-offs are coming to an end? I think our goal is to deliver a much cleaner, more predictable profile. And the last few years have been anything but that with transformation charges, obviously the bank levy that introduces volatility, some of the litigation items that have come at us that we hadn't expected to fall out the way they did. And while we can, you can never guarantee that there won't be new things coming up, if I look at the various risks and uncertainties that lie ahead, they're much fewer than lies behind us. And so I'd like to think that our path to normalization is close. There would be, I mean, if I look to 2024, we do expect some restructuring charges in 2024, perhaps \u20ac400 million, that's still an elevated level relative to what I would think of as normalized. And clearly our goal is that by 2025, we will have normalized in respect of both restructuring and severance and litigation. So one of the reasons our investment in non-financial risk is so critical in the control environments is, stop making ourselves vulnerable to those types of things. So we do think we're much closer to providing a normalized picture and also to having the levers in our hands to offset adverse developments better."

The first question is related to trading revenues, which you indicated, I think James, has started very well. And I just wanted to see what you're comparing this to, is this year-on-year comparison? And what is driving that, I assume, in fixed income? Secondly, can you also talk clearly in that context around the investment banking fee pool where I think you also indicated momentum is continuing from what you said earlier at a recent conference. And then secondly, just coming back to cost, clearly the target is adjusted cost \u20ac5 billion, about \u20ac5 billion, and just if you can talk a little bit about the levers that you have in case you will not be able to get to about \u20ac5 billion and what \u20ac5 billion about actually mean, is plus or minus 4%, 5%, how should we think about that?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Thank you. Let me start, and then James will for sure add. Look, Kian, thanks for your question. I think on the trading revenues, we know it's obviously early days with January, but what are we doing? We are comparing it to last year. We are comparing it to our own plan. And we also look at the consistency actually of the day-to-day trading also with regard to our VAR. And it looks very healthy. It looks very kind of a consistent picture across the different sectors in the trading area. So it is broad based across the regions. And I would say one reason for the strong start is for sure that we have been investing and Ram has really built up the FIC business over the last five years, quarter-by-quarter. And of course, the latest rating upgrade by S&P also helps. I mean, these are all things which are then self fulfilling, so to say, you will remember my speeches that each rating upgrade also means that obviously clients are coming back, are doing different and more trades with us. We are changing the ISTAS [ph], all that is coming through. And therefore, we can see that, yes, January was good and nice and better than we expected. But I can see from the basis and foundation that in my view, this is a quite consistent trend. And I also expect. By the way, we said that 78% of the 2023 revenue year were recurring revenues, which is a pretty good picture. And therefore, I also expect, with all the investments we have done in the sort of say more stable business that we have a solid and strong start into January. On the fee income in the O&A. Yes, we expect a recovery in 2024. It is always very hard to say when exactly, but we have planned our investments last year in terms of the Numis acquisition, but also in terms of the hiring on the O&A side, with regard to a long-term development of the bank. We wanted to invest into our capital-light business and fortunately, we can now see the results of that. So also here, we can see a recovery in terms of mandates, a recovery in terms of market activities. And therefore, we do believe that we will see, compared to 2023, a nice uptick in the revenues. And the first results we have already seen also in January. But again, I know it's just the first 30 days of the year, but also they are very promising and that what we wanted to achieve is coming through. On the cost side, look, James just said it and he will give you more details, but, A, we have a full focus to Q4, showing you already in Q1 that we hit a \u20ac5 billion run rate in Q1. This has daily management, daily monitoring, weekly in the management board. And I'm very confident that we will achieve that number of around \u20ac5.0 billion in Q1. Now, why am I overall so confident on that? Because of that, what James said. I mean, if you take the \u20ac21.7 billion cost and we need to come to \u20ac20 billion, we will expect non-operating costs to decrease by around \u20ac700 million. We will again expect approximately a reduction of bank levies in the amount of \u20ac350 million to \u20ac400 million in 2024 versus 2023. That would bring us roughly to \u20ac20.5 billion. And now we are looking at that, what we are constantly managing with the front office, with the back offices, under Rebecca's leadership. And that means we expect that we have another \u20ac400 million net reduction from all what is still coming of our operational efficiency program. You know, the \u20ac2.5 billion of gross reductions, we have delivered savings, or expected savings of \u20ac1.3 billion, of which \u20ac900 million have been realized up to now. And the remainder comes from \u20ac600 million in Germany. In the optimization, Claudio is doing, in particular, on the business side, with all the rationalization, on the branch side, with all the investments which have been done into unity, and now we are getting the fruits out of this. We have on technology and infrastructure, another \u20ac700 million, which we will reduce application decommissioning and so on. And then you know that we are, for our core processes, we have invested a lot of money and we will do this also going forward in the front to back process redesign, where we think we will get another \u20ac300 million out. Now, against that, there is obviously some inflation, some business growth, but that makes us highly, highly confident that we can get the next \u20ac400 million to \u20ac500 million of operational efficiency net out. And that brings us to the \u20ac20 billion. The good thing is that is the long-term plan for 2024 and 2025. But if you see the bottom up plan for the first quarter, we will achieve the 5.0 on a rounded basis this quarter."

        "text": "So \u2013 and Kian, I entirely endorse what Christian just went through, and it\u2019s just to put a couple of numbers behind it as well. In FIC, I would draw your attention to Page 47 of the analyst deck, where we tried to give you a little bit more color on how the FIC franchise performs on a daily basis. And relative to its VaR, and so it gives you a good kind of comparison as to what so far the quarter might look like compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. I think the second thing to add the \u2013 in the corporate finance wallet, if you look at some of the external sort of providers of data on that marketplace, I think those providers would say that the will \u2013 that the wallet will grow sort of 15% to 20% this year, as Christian just outlined, that obviously still needs to happen, but we think the conditions are there. And as Christian just outlined through Numis and the other hires we\u2019ve invested to participate in that. And then lastly on expenses, to give you a sense of what we would think is a significant \u2013 is a range of outcomes, 1% rather than 4% is that we have the discipline, and for us missing by 1% or \u20ac50 million would be a disappointment. And that gives you a sense of how we\u2019re managing the place."

        "text": "Good morning. Thank you for the questions. One on revenues and one on costs. On the revenue side, you\u2019ve given a lot of detail on NII and NII trajectory. You\u2019ve given us \u20ac32 billion for 2025, hinted to \u20ac30 billion still for this year. But could you put a little bit more meat on the bones, please? That would be by division and expectations by division, but also on the non-NII growth in terms of what you see in terms of fee momentum and beyond the \u2013 our NII piece, but also on loan growth as well, which clearly is baked into your NII assumptions. So some more color around revenue and revenue expectations on why we should be as bullish as you guys are with the great. And secondly, on cost and cost trajectory, you\u2019re talking to \u20ac5 billion for Q1. Clearly the run rate for next year is going to be below that if you\u2019re going to get to \u20ac20 billion. So what does that adjusted cost look like through this year? Do we actually end up kind of below \u20ac5 billion by the end of the year? And so the adjusted cost print could be in kind of the \u20ac20 billion range for 2024. Obviously, the reported number might be higher, but I\u2019m thinking about adjusted cost only at this stage. Thank you."

        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "So I\u2019ll \u2013 I can start. Christian, you may want to add. So on revenues, Adam, first of all, I \u2013 we provided the additional disclosure on net interest revenues or net interest income to try to sort of put that to one side. Hopefully, that\u2019s helpful disclosure and indicates the relatively high degree of confidence we have on delivery against that, whether that\u2019s by hedging out the remaining sort of curve or also indicating how conservative we think we\u2019re being on, for example, beta assumptions and growth in volumes. But set that to one side and then that allows you to focus on the non-interest revenues. There to give you a sense, we think all of the businesses are poised to grow their revenues on non-interest side pretty considerably. When you just think of all the sources of non-interest revenues we have, I mean, start with a Corporate Bank, custody transactions, payments, the merchant acquiring business, the documentary custody business. We earn fees and across that business in lots of different ways that do cohere with the overall sort of performance and level of activity in the marketplace. In Asset Management and Private Bank, obviously the assets under management are the key driver and therefore our inflows are encouraging to us. It means our step off into 2024 is higher than the average considerably in both businesses that we ran at in 2023. And we also think in general investor behavior particularly in the international private bank wealth management business has been relatively muted. So we think there's growth opportunity as well. And that then leads you to the investment bank, we've talked about where we \u2013 what we see as a recovery in origination and advisory coupled with potentially market share expansion, given the investments that we've made. And that's encouraging to us. And we think there's also runway in FIC as we've continued to put investments in place across sort of, I won't call them, the adjacency. So within our footprint areas where we think we're underperforming our potential. And Ram and his team have been very deliberate executing on those investments. We think that also will provide a strong backdrop. In terms of \u2013 to give you orders of magnitude, obviously the origination advisory piece is the largest in terms of our expectations in absolute terms. But it's also the market in our view that has been most muted in the past couple of years. So there we think of it less as growth from a foundation rather than recovery. And that's something we see the preconditions as clearly in place for."

      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "I just want to add one item and just to give you a little bit of a feel, Adam, also how stable the revenues, for instance, in the corporate bank has performed over the last six months. Of course, we have already seen in the corporate bank on a monthly basis some kind of normalization on the NII, but that was always fully compensated already by fee income given our investments, which we have done. And we feel that this is also happening in 2024 given the mandates which we have won. You remember potentially that in October in the earnings call, we talked about the increase of one mandates with multinational corporates. Well, that is continuing and obviously this is helping us now a lot also to go against the NII normalization in the corporate bank. So it is actually a healthy \u2013 it\u2019s a healthy distribution going forward. And if I then think from a starting point of view that we have, as James is just saying, \u20ac57 billion of additional assets under management in the private bank and in asset management. And what already that brings us at the start of the year, which we already sort of say captured, that makes us highly confident that we come to that number, which you just quoted, the \u20ac30 billion for 2024."

It was basically \u20ac4.9 billion for much of the year and then it could crept up to \u20ac5 billion as we'd advertised. It did kind of go further than we expected, but we'd like to bring it back to \u20ac5 billion and if possible, below. What that depends on is strong execution of our initiatives, controlling, if you like, the throttling of investments so that we line them up with the crystallization of savings. And to Chris's point at the outset, the absence of surprises. But we feel like we've got the tools in our hands to achieve that and a lot of hard work lies ahead, but we've got a clear path. I do want to say as a proviso, all of that, one of the things we always found difficult in talking about absolute expense numbers is FX can move it around. So you have to keep that in mind.

As an aside, I didn't see the 10% group target for 2025, but I guess that's still in place. But my question was on the return on tangible in the investment bank. It was only 4% in 2023, after 8.4% in 2022 and 9.4% in 2021. So what's your target return on tangible book for the investment bank in 2025, please? And the second is a geeky question on U.S. CRE, the Q3 stage, you said there was just \u20ac3 billion of U.S. CRE loans to be modified in the next 15 months, but you did \u20ac2.3 billion already in Q4. So what's your revised expectation for the next 12 months in terms of modifications? And do you have an update on the \u20ac0.9 billion stressed lost estimates you gave at the Q3 stage, please? Thank you."

Very simply, just it's a kind of law of averages that we have, and what gives us real comfort there is we've been going through some amount of transition as well in the mix of business, where as we shift to more capital light revenue sources, you should be able to see that a strong lift and the investment bank will also benefit from some of the cost saving initiatives that are there in their allocated expenses. So we think their path to that 10%, well above 10%, is reasonably clear. On U.S. CRE, actually, I don\u2019t have a number to hand. We are continuing to work through, and I just want to make one distinction clear. There are maturities and extensions of loans and then modifications. And so we think there\u2019s about \u20ac10 billion of either extension or maturity events to work through this year. Some of which will lead to modifications of various sorts and then applying the percentage that we show you of 4%, 4.5%, you\u2019d expect some of that to obviously translate into credit loss provisions. So hopefully that gives you a sense on both of those questions."

Secondly, our focus in bringing the cost down is on the infrastructure and he said that. I would also like to mention that if you simply look at the market comparison of Deutsche Bank versus other peers and you look revenues over RWA, the investment bank is doing actually already an excellent job. So it\u2019s now very much about the composition and the balance of revenues, which we are starting and started to address last year with our investments. And I can see that the O&A business is obviously coming back in 2024 and the infrastructure cost. So I think the investment bank on the top line versus RWA is actually already doing an excellent job. And obviously we expect that to be maintained. And last but not least, just for clarification, you indicated it at the start. It\u2019s a full confirmation. Yes, we clearly confirm the larger 10% RoTE for the year 2025. There is no doubt."

Unfortunately, as you know, we don\u2019t give detailed information about what goes in and out of the litigation provisions. Your point is, it\u2019s a large one and that is fair. I can\u2019t say more, really. It\u2019s a long standing provision that we\u2019ve held and now taken the view there isn\u2019t any more basis to retain it. On CRE, look, I could imagine that the next couple of quarters, Q1, Q2, could remain elevated, but I can also \u2013 and my own expectation is that it would begin to sort of ameliorate towards the second half of the year and into 2025. You shouldn\u2019t be surprised if it were in line with 2023 as sort of a baseline expectation, and in an ideal world, it might be a little bit better than 2023. We will publish a revised stress scenario in our annual report. I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably deteriorated a little bit given the circumstances we see in the marketplace. And as you can see, cumulatively, we\u2019re tracking closer to the level that we\u2019d laid out in our Q2 and Q3 reporting. That said, and I think it\u2019s important to say, as you think about our forward guidance, if you take out the \u20ac450 million across the various portfolios that we booked in commercial real estate in 2023 and take that out of the numbers, you can see a CLP level that is running actually in a relatively normalized range. And that\u2019s in a year in which we actually incurred some losses, particularly in the Private Bank that went beyond what we would normally see in the Private Bank. You recall a couple of idiosyncratic cases in the first quarter and then in the third and fourth quarter some amount of, what I call, excess provisioning associated with the operational backlog issue. So we think that all gives us confidence that as this cycle in commercial real estate abates over the next six quarters, you should see a much more normalized credit loss provision emerge."

We also made various proposals to the German government together, by the way, with all banks, the saving banks, the cooperative banks, and the private banks, how we actually can use that money nicely in order to fund the transformation in Germany. It seems to be that the German government is going another route and obviously we need to review that from all kind of perspectives, as you can imagine. But to your clear question for the guidance of 2024 and 2025, this is not part of our plan, i.e. there is no cost plan where this is included because for the time being we assume that this is not coming our way. But of course, we need to review it from a legal point of view."

        "text": "Hi, good morning, and thank you for all the new disclosure, in particular on NII and costs. I want to ask you, however, a question on capital. Specifically, there have been some headlines on potential M&A, which is something that you also looked at domestic M&A few years ago, but that seems to be at odds [ph] with what we hear today, your big commitment to capital distribution. So how do we square these two, and what would take you to pursue some big M&A? That's the first question. And then the second question is more of a numbers question. Sorry. Going back to the costs again, I hear a lot of conviction on \u20ac20 billion by 2025 underlying and one-offs reducing. So what is a sort of run rate for restructuring costs? Do you expect it to be \u20ac400 million in 2024 and then down to \u20ac200 million? And, yes any similar comment on other potential one-offs? Thanks."

And on costs it's hard to say with perfect accuracy what it is that these litigation and restructuring severance, obviously the latter is more in our control. If I look to 2025, I think \u20ac400 million collectively for the two would be a reasonable kind of planning assumption, and we'd like to do better than that. Clearly, one of the things that we're working to do is put the remaining restructuring items behind us now in 2024, I've given you an estimate of what that looks like. And as I said earlier, one does looking at our litigation sort of portfolio, one does feel that it's changing in terms of kind of number and size of events. Now, it's never a perfect forecast, but it's certainly something that we're hoping to work down to a more normalized level. So, I'll give you \u20ac300 million to \u20ac400 million is probably a good planning assumption across the two."

        "speaker": "Jeremy Sigee",
        "text": "Thank you. Just a couple of number detail things, please. Firstly, on the capital returns, can I just clarify what has been deducted from capital already is it the \u20ac0.45 and the \u20ac675 million, buyback but no extra have those both been deducted, and linked to that is the constraint when you talk about the 50% payout for the returns done over the course of this year, and in particular in the second half of this year, is the constraint 50% of this year's earnings, 2024, or constraint being 50% of last year's earnings, which a lot of it was accrued out of. And then the last question was just on the costs, I know we've talked a lot about it, but in the divisions, both the IB and the Corporate Bank were about \u20ac100 million heavier in the quarter, and I wasn't very clear. I wonder if you could just talk a bit more about how much of that was specific items or sort of year end extra, and how much of that falls away. That'd be very helpful. Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Sure. Jeremy, I think I got both of your questions, but feel free to follow up. Look, we would like to stick to the 50%. We think that's prudent and ideally not go beyond. By putting out the dividend guidance that we have, I think the indication is management is confident of its ability to grow earnings from here. If you think about 50% of our net income to common for 2023, that actually gives us still a fair amount of room against the \u20ac1.6 billion that we've talked about today. To your question about what is, if you like, disregarded in the ratio based on interim profit recognition, the answer is the \u20ac900 million, the 45 cents [ph] is disregarded in the December ratio, the \u20ac675 million is not removed from that. The \u20ac675 million we see as part of a discretionary program rather than the 50% payout ratio assumption, which in essence wasn't in place for 2020 \u2013 in respect of 2023. That \u20ac675 million would represent about 20 basis points. And so in the rounding, we'd be at 13.5, maybe 13.6 pro forma for that second buyback. In IB and CB costs, I do want to just remind that CB took the lion's share of the FDIC assessment, so there's noise this quarter on that, as well as last year in the fourth quarter, there was a \u2013 what I'll call a true up in the internal service cost allocation. So that's been a bigger feature in for CB than the others. And in IB, of course, we\u2019ve \u2013 that's seen a fair amount of the investment in 2023, including, obviously, Numis in the fourth quarter. So noise in both. And as we strip away now in Q1, you should see what I'll call as a cleaner run rate in both of those businesses."

        "speaker": "Andrew Coombs",
        "text": "Good morning. Two questions, please. Firstly, thank you for the net interest income walk. In the guidance for the decline that you gave for 2024, you talked about moving to a steady state level on deposit pricing. Perhaps you could just elaborate there on what your steady state deposit beta assumption is? I think your peers are at 40%, but perhaps you could elaborate there? Secondly, coming back to the non-net interest income growth, it looks like you're targeting \u20ac1.6 billion a year in both 2024 and 2025, 9% to 10%. It's a very healthy run rate that you're guiding to. Within that, you've mentioned the four different components. So fixed income, origination & advisory, wealth and asset management. And you said that origination & advisory is the biggest component within that. But perhaps I could ask two things. Number one, can you split out the growth between those four? And secondly, how much of it is driven by industry wallet versus how much is market share gains? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "So I'll speak to the beta. Look, we sort of made a policy decision, if you like, not to talk about betas in specific terms externally. What we have seen, and I think we've talked about this before, our portfolios are quite varied. And by that I mean the deposit portfolio breaks out between private bank and corporate bank. And then in each of those businesses, really euros and dollars. And then, of course, there's a dynamic around what is site and what is term. So there's different sort of behaviors across those things. What we are thinking could happen is that with the expectation of the market now, that policy rates will start to go down, that the long-term interest rates have gone down. You may see a peak in terms of pass through, or we may have in fact seen a peak in terms of pass through, because now banks are reacting and our clients are reacting to a changed interest rate environment. And hence we could \u2013 can't say this was certainly, but we could be near a peak of the pass through associated with the rate increase cycle we've just been through. And now the question will flip to how sticky will customer rates be on the way down? So a completely different dynamic.  As I've said, our \u2013 and we said this in Q3, and I guess I'd reiterate this, our beta assumptions assume a continued convergence towards the models as though the trend was still upwards, although there's a possibility, as I say, that we've peaked and may run flat for a period of time before things start to move down. So an interesting dynamic around the betas. In terms of the split, I don't want to go into too much detail, but I would say relatively evenly split between private bank, corporate bank and the fixed income and currencies business. So producing, let's just say about half of the rise, if I would put it in rough terms and about the other half in O&A. And as I've mentioned, we see O&A as a recovery rather than a growth from a, kind of a steady state level and in that number you might see two-thirds of it be the market and a third be market share. But again, those are very rough estimates that we're sort of looking at in our planning. Lots of things can move, but I hope what you take away from that is how broad based the sources that we're looking at are. And as we've talked about, much of the revenue base becoming predictable around input drivers and output revenues that it produces alongside as we show you now a relatively predictable net interest income stream, including incidentally the breakout now of what we're calling the banking book businesses, which include the financing in FIC. So hopefully that's some good color on what we're seeing and is driving the raised guidance."

        "text": "Hi, morning. Thanks for taking my question. So firstly, on that non-NII guidance that you've lifted, it does seem a large part of that is based on self help and investments, but I guess some part also based on market growth. So I guess my question here is what's your assumption for GDP growth backing your guidance here and in particular for Germany? And then my second question is back on your cost guidance you're guiding to \u20ac5 billion for 1Q and I guess about \u20ac20 billion for the year. But typically you've had about \u20ac5.3 billion, \u20ac5.4 billion for the 1Q and then a bit less than \u20ac5 billion for the remaining quarters to reflect the seasonality of stronger revenues in the first quarter. So just wondering how you're thinking about that now? What's happening with the seasonality through the year?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Yes. So, Andrew, thanks for the questions. So the bigger driver of the Q1 numbers has been the bank levy and we've had to go through the adjustment sort of hoops on that. And we think it was still to be finalized and determined, but we think that noise will be removed. And also, ironically we've had to book some bank levy in Q4 because of the way the dynamic works between the UK and the European bank levies. So in a sense brought forward some bank levy from 2024 into 2023. You're right that there is some seasonality, especially with variable compensation bookings, but on a relative basis to a big number like \u20ac5 billion, that is not a massive driver. But something we look at and manage carefully, given the importance of it to our business. On the assumptions of GDP growth, we just use a consensus view. And that consensus view obviously already reflects pretty muted GDP growth performance, especially in Germany. So zero, slightly negative, relatively muted in Europe, but in the United States and Asia, probably assumptions that right now are a little bit behind what the consensus views. To be fair, GDP isn't necessarily the main driver of the engines that we're talking about of the fee and commission income growth, I'd say it's more activity. And by activity I mean loan fees on trade finance, which has been relatively muted. I mean transactions in terms of issuance where we also in our Trust and Agency and Securities get business, get fees on custody and also transfer agency and the like. So it is activity levels that really are the driver and they cohere more just with corporate and household confidence than specifically GDP growth assumptions."

First, as a follow-up, you mentioned that the non-NII revenue growth could be perhaps coming maybe two-thirds from market growth and one-third from market share growth. Looking at this and the \u20ac32 billion implied revenue target by 2025, could you give us a sense what degree of flexibility do you see on the cost side? Should perhaps some disappointment happen? Maybe from the market growth side, what levers do you have to pull? Should there be a disappointment on revenues? Because clearly you are doing a lot to hit that \u20ac20 billion adjusted cost target. That\u2019s the first question. The second one is on capital management and specifically M&A. I think we\u2019ve heard you loud and clear that you\u2019re focused on distribution mainly, but you\u2019re also looking at perhaps accelerating growth in some areas and investing in the divisions. Do you see scope for perhaps bolt-on acquisitions along the lines of Numis here and there? And if that\u2019s the case, where do you see opportunities? You can accelerate the organic growth and what would be your criteria? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Thank you. Let me start with the last one. One cannot exclude that. And if there is an opportunity in one of our core businesses that we have an add-on acquisition, which makes sense from a content point of view, from a regional point of view, from a client point of view, and it fits into our culture, I wouldn\u2019t exclude that. But it\u2019s not the main focus of our strategy. And when we came to the previous questions and the headlines, I was referring to in particular the bigger M&A\u2019s, which is not our priority. But if we would have an opportunity, I would always say we would potentially look at it. But again, we feel that with the existing platform we have, with the existing franchise we have, we are really on a good path to achieve the goals be it on the revenue side or on the cost side. I like your questions on the cost side with regard to the flexibility. Yes, we have clearly an ambitious road on the non-NII, but I can see already how in particular in the O&A business, our investments, both in Numis by the way, which is running really well, but also the hiring of the people, which we have done, is adding in terms of mandates and also revenues. Also when I look now at Q1, but clearly if it\u2019s not coming, we have a dynamic process. And that dynamic process is that the business has to explain to the CFO, but also to me what they are doing if the revenues are not coming through. Now, to be very honest, we build it for the long term. And I think it\u2019s the right decision for us to expand in that business. But clearly if revenues would lag, then obviously you have various levers, be it in that area also variable comp. We have other investments, which are part of our plan for those business, which we can reduce in this regard we would proactively, obviously countermeasure."

First of all, the focus there was on origination advisory, and I may have inverted what I meant to say is two-thirds we think comes from market and one-third from market share growth. But again, those are estimates. I guess the one other thing just to point out on your capital question, Slide 17 of the deck, what we tried to indicate is in the last 25% block there of how we would apply the capital is sort of stuff. It is whatever we\u2019re not able to offset of CRR3 through our capital management measures, then either ratio build more distribution would be built into that and also some leeway to pursue bolt-on acquisitions or have the capital impact of bolt-on acquisitions if we find the right opportunities. We\u2019ve talked in the past what those opportunities typically look like, we\u2019ve been clear that DWS, the asset management business, has been seeking opportunities and we would put capital to work there. We\u2019ve looked at other opportunities over time. But I guess the thing to point to is just we would be disciplined about targeting investment opportunities that are, relatively speaking, capital light and strategically on point, as Numis was with our Global Hausbank strategy."

At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Ioana Patriniche, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2024 results call. As usual, our Chief Executive Officer, Christian Sewing, will speak first; followed by our Chief Financial Officer, James von Moltke. The presentation always is available to download in the Investor Relations section of our website, db.com. Before we get started, let me just remind you that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which may not develop as we currently expect. We therefore ask you to take notice of the precautionary warning at the end of our materials. With that, let me hand over to Christian.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, Ioana, and a warm welcome from me. I'm delighted to be discussing our first quarter results with you today. In February, we laid out a clear path to our 2025 objectives for financial performance and capital distributions, and we have delivered in line with our objectives and targets. Group revenues were \u20ac7.8 billion. This reflects business growth and franchise momentum, particularly in areas where we have been investing like our capital-light businesses, while net interest income was more resilient than expected. This performance underlines the benefit of our complementary business mix. We are delivering on our cost targets. Adjusted costs were in line with our commitment to a quarterly run rate of around \u20ac5 billion for this year. Provision for credit losses remained elevated this quarter, but in line with our expectations and prior guidance, considering where we are in the credit cycle. Portfolio quality remains very solid, and we continue to expect provisions for the year to be at the higher end of our guidance range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans. Our return on tangible equity was 8.7% in the first quarter, up from 8.3% in the first quarter last year. Capital remains robust. Our CET1 ratio was 13.4%, enabling us to remain on track in raising distributions through shareholders and supporting business growth. Let me unpack some of the drivers of our first quarter results on Slide 2. Pre-provision profit was up by 11% year-on-year to \u20ac2.5 billion and more than 20% higher since we launched our global house bank strategy. This reflected continued progress on driving operating leverage, which is a core element of our strategy execution. We increased revenues in our operating divisions by 3% year-on-year, while group revenues were up 1% on a reported basis. Group revenues include Corporate and Other, which tends to add some level of volatility into our revenue line. As committed, we delivered growth in noninterest revenues and saw an increase of 11% year-on-year in commissions and fee income, mainly in divisions where we made investments last year. As expected, our reported net interest income declined this quarter, but net interest income remained stable in our banking books, and James will shortly talk you through this in more detail. We reduced adjusted costs by 6% year-on-year and 5% sequentially to around \u20ac5 billion, in line with our guidance. This includes bank levies and higher compensation costs, which James will discuss later. Now let's look at the franchise achievements across all divisions on Slide 3. The Corporate Bank delivered strong business growth with a 5% increase in incremental deals won with multinational corporate clients compared to the prior year quarter. We closed a series of landmark project finance transactions and saw strong momentum across the structured credit market and trust and agency services. We also ranked #1 in 17 categories in the 2024 Euromoney Trade Finance survey, including being the best trade finance bank in Western Europe for the seventh consecutive year. Demonstrating the strength of our business model, the Investment Bank delivered a strong quarter with notable advances across the franchise. Investments in talent boosted our origination and advisory market share to 2.6%, a 70 basis point increase compared to the full year 2023 with notable gains in LDCM and DCM, elevating our global ranking from 11th to 7th. Our advisory franchise benefited from the breadth of our product set in the quarter. In GTCR's acquisition of Worldpay, we provided an integrated offering from financial advice to debt financing through to FX and rate hedging. The revenue increase in FIC was driven by both financing and our well-balanced business portfolio, which supports our revenue profile through the cycle. We maintained our strength in credit trading driven by our investments in 2023, particularly in the flow business, and we also grew revenues in the Americas. These developments further diversified revenue mix in our portfolio. The Private Bank benefited from our investments, accelerated business momentum delivered \u20ac12 billion of net inflows in the first quarter, which makes it 17 consecutive quarters of net inflows bringing the total assets under management to \u20ac606 billion with a strategic shift towards fee-generating investment solutions. We also continue to strengthen capabilities in strategic areas by increasing coverage of ultra-high net worth individuals in Germany and enhanced offering of investment solutions including third-party exclusive collaborations, which should drive further inflows. Asset Management delivered another strong quarter of volume growth. Net inflows were \u20ac9 billion ex cash, helping assets under management grew by \u20ac45 billion to \u20ac941 billion, over \u20ac100 billion higher than in the prior year quarter, which we expect to support future revenue generation. Now let me turn to the progress against our strategic objectives on Slide 4. Starting with revenues. We have delivered a compound annual growth rate of 6% since 2021 in line with our raised target range of 5.5% to 6.5% from 2021 to 2025. As promised, we grew mainly in capital-light businesses with strong growth in origination and advisory as well as in the Private Bank and in Asset Management, supported by high inflows of assets under management, underlying our franchise momentum. We aim to build on these developments as our franchise expense following our investments in growth initiatives across all business segments. With net interest income resilient at the start of the year and growth in noninterest revenues, we feel we are well on our way to our 2025 revenue ambitions. We continue to deliver on our \u20ac2.5 billion operational efficiency program. We have completed measures, which delivered our expected savings of \u20ac1.4 billion, nearly 60% of our target with around \u20ac1 billion in savings already realized. The incremental efficiencies this quarter were driven by optimization of our business in Germany and reshaping of our workforce and non-client-facing roads. We have further incremental measures already underway, including reengineering of our operating model via additional front-to-back improvements of product processes and harmonization of infrastructure capabilities. This gives us full confidence that we will deliver on our commitment of a quarterly run rate of adjusted cost of around \u20ac5 billion in 2024 and total cost of around \u20ac20 billion in 2025. Finally, on capital efficiency, we achieved a further \u20ac2 billion reduction in RWAs, bringing aggregate reductions to \u20ac15 billion. As we are intensifying our work on capital efficiency with further reductions coming from data and process improvements as well as securitization, we remain highly confident that we can meet our target range of \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion. Let me conclude with a few words on our strategy on Slide 5. In a nutshell, we delivered on all key initiatives and targets in the first quarter. And as we progress on our global house bank strategy, we are on the right path for both our clients and our shareholders. First, we have a strong and growing franchise. Clients come to us as our well-balanced, complementary businesses provide them with full service products and solutions. This supports our revenue growth through different market cycles and drive our market share. And as we said consistently, Clients want a partner that offers them an alternative to large U.S. banks, a partner with our expertise, product range and global network. Second, we continue to improve our operational efficiency. We are maintaining our cost discipline. And as always, we are committed to our approach of self-funding our investments. 2023 marked the peak of our investments, but we continue to invest to reduce the complexity of our organization through improving technology, processes and control capabilities. Finally, we are absolutely focused on creating value for our shareholders. And as we said in previous quarters, we are fully committed to increasing shareholder distributions as rewarding our shareholders is a top priority. We are confident we can increase distributions well beyond our original goal of \u20ac8 billion in respect of the financial year 2021 to 2025, and we expect to continue to grow dividends and make incremental share buybacks. With that, let me hand over to James.\nJames von Moltke: Thank you, Christian. Let me start with a few key performance indicators on Slide 7 and place them in the context of our 2025 targets. Christian mentioned our continued business momentum, which resulted in revenue growth of 6% on a compound basis for the last 12 months relative to 2021, the midpoint of our recently upgraded revenue growth target range. The cost/income ratio of 68% in the first quarter shows a 7 percentage point improvement against 2023, driven by operating leverage from sustained revenue growth and cost management. Our return on tangible common equity was 8.7% for the first quarter. Our capital position remained robust with the CET1 ratio at 13.4% this quarter after absorbing the impact of the share repurchase and the deduction for future distributions in line with revised EBA rules, reflecting our payout ratio policy. Our liquidity metrics also remained strong. The liquidity coverage ratio was 136%, above our target of around 130% and the net stable funding ratio was 123%. In short, our performance in the period reaffirms our resilience and our confidence in reaching our 2025 targets. With that, let me turn to the first quarter highlights on Slide 8. Group revenues were \u20ac7.8 billion, up 1% on the first quarter of 2023 or 2%, excluding specific items. Noninterest expenses were \u20ac5.3 billion, down 3% year-on-year. Nonoperating costs this quarter included litigation charges of \u20ac166 million and \u20ac95 million of restructuring and severance charges. Adjusted costs decreased 6% year-on-year, mainly due to lower bank levies. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac439 million or 37 basis points of average loans, and I will discuss this in more detail shortly. We generated a profit before tax of \u20ac2 billion, up 10% year-on-year and a net profit of \u20ac1.5 billion, also up 10% compared to the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share was \u20ac0.69 in the first quarter and tangible book value per share was \u20ac29.26, up 7% year-on-year. Our tax rate in the quarter was 29%. Let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results. Let me start with a review of our net interest income on Slide 9. Net interest income for the group decreased by approximately \u20ac100 million compared to the previous quarter with the reduction being driven by accounting effects. As a reminder, these effects are revenue-neutral at the group level as the decrease in NII is offset by an increase in noninterest revenues. Excluding these accounting effects, banking book NII was essentially flat as the decline in the private bank was offset by an increase in the corporate bank and lower funding costs in the Investment Bank and Corporate and Other. The reduction in the Private Bank net interest margin was largely driven by the non-recurrence of favorable episodic effects in the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as the ongoing impact of beta normalization. On an absolute basis, net interest income in the Private Bank is in line with the plans on which our NII guidance from last quarter was based. The increase in corporate bank NII was due to a positive one-off impact from a CLO recovery, which was accounted as NII with deposit betas showing a steady increase in line with our assumptions. We expect to see a corporate bank NII decline in the coming quarters as betas continue to normalize. NII in fixed financing was essentially flat quarter-on-quarter. We're starting to see margin expansion on the asset side, which if it continues, will help offset margin compression from beta normalization. In summary, the development in the first quarter reinforces our expectation that we will meet or improve on our prior guidance of a \u20ac600 million reduction in banking book NII for 2024 relative to the prior year. With that, let's turn to adjusted cost development on Slide 10. Adjusted costs were around \u20ac5 billion for the quarter, specifically \u20ac5.02 billion, excluding bank levies, up 3% year-on-year, but down 4% sequentially, in line with our guidance. We were disciplined in most expense categories and the modest increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefit costs, reflecting inflationary pressures on fixed remunerations and increases in internal workforce after our targeted investments in talent throughout 2023 and higher performance-related compensation. The increase in compensation and benefit costs was partially offset by workforce optimization. Let's now turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 11. Provision for credit losses in the first quarter was \u20ac439 million, equivalent to 37 basis points of average loans. The decline compared to the previous quarter was driven by moderate stage 1 and 2 releases of \u20ac32 million due to improved macroeconomic forecast and model recalibration effects, which occurred in the prior quarter. Stage 3 provisions at \u20ac471 million remained elevated at a similar level to the previous quarter. This included continued weakness in the commercial real estate sector, mainly impacting the Investment Bank and the continued impact of operational backlogs in the Private Bank. Our full year guidance for provisions is unchanged at the higher end of the range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans. This reflects our expectation that provisions will remain elevated in the first half of the year and should gradually reduce in the second half. The decline is expected to be driven by an improvement in the credit commercial real estate sector and the partial reversal of backlog-related provisions in the Private Bank. Before we move to performance in our businesses, let me turn to capital on Slide 12. Our first quarter common equity Tier 1 ratio came in at 13.4% compared to 13.7% at year-end 2023. We had a strong capital supply this quarter and the sequential decline was driven by our distribution actions and plans together with business growth. 19 basis points of the decrease reflects the ECB approval for our \u20ac675 million share buyback, which we commenced in March. Half of the first quarter net income was deducted for future capital distributions in line with our 50% payout ratio guidance, with the remainder supporting other deductions. 12 basis points of the decrease came from RWA growth. The increase in RWA is net of reductions due to RWA optimization achieved during the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, our leverage ratio was 4.5%, 8 basis points lower compared to the previous quarter. The decline was primarily driven by lower Tier 1 capital in line with the movement in CET1 capital, with leverage exposure broadly unchanged. With that, let's now turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 14. Corporate Bank revenues in the first quarter were \u20ac1.9 billion, essentially flat sequentially and 5% lower compared to the prior year quarter, which marked the revenue peak of the current rate cycle. Year-on-year, the revenue decrease reflected the normalization of deposit revenues, lower loan net interest income and the discontinuation of remuneration of minimum reserves by the ECB predominantly impacting our corporate treasury services businesses, partly offset by 3% higher commissions and fee income. On a sequential basis, the revenue of development mainly reflected lower overnight NII. Loans declined by \u20ac5 billion compared to the prior year quarter and remained flat sequentially, reflecting muted demand and our continued selective balance sheet deployment. Deposits were \u20ac31 billion higher year-on-year and over \u20ac10 billion higher than the fourth quarter, mainly driven by higher term deposits. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac63 million or 22 basis points of average loans, essentially flat versus the prior year, reflecting resilience of the corporate loan book. Noninterest expenses decreased sequentially driven by lower internal service cost allocations and the FDIC special assessment charge in the prior quarter, but increased year-on-year due to higher litigation costs. This resulted in a post-tax return on tangible equity of 15.4% and a cost income ratio of 64%. I'll now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 15. Revenues for the first quarter were 13% higher year-on-year on a reported basis or 14% when excluding specific items. Revenues in fixed income and currencies increased by 7% versus the prior year quarter demonstrating the underlying diversification of the business. Financing performance was solid with revenues up 14% year-on-year, reflecting a robust carry profile and strong levels of issuance and securitization fees. As this is the first time we are disclosing financing revenue separately, you can find further information on the composition of the business in the appendix on Slide 38. Credit trading revenues were again significantly higher year-on-year as the business continued to build on the successful execution of our strategic initiatives and investments made through 2023, specifically in the Flow business. Emerging Markets revenues were also significantly higher, with revenues up across all 3 regions. Client activity was up year-on-year, aided by the investments in Latin America. Foreign Exchange revenues were significantly higher, benefiting from the non-repeat of the interest rate market dislocation seen in the prior year. The impact of a refocused business model with investments into controls and technology are also beginning to materialize and collaboration with the wider franchise is driving cross-sell revenues in the quarter. Rates revenues were significantly lower when compared to a very strong prior year quarter and reflected a reduction in market volatility. Moving to Origination and Advisory, revenues were up 54% when compared to the prior year quarter, with the business gaining market share in a growing fee pool environment, both year-on-year and versus the prior quarter. Debt Origination revenues were significantly higher, benefiting from a material improvement in the leveraged debt market conditions. While investment-grade debt issuance activity was also higher year-on-year. Advisory revenues increased versus the prior year despite a reduction in the industry fee pool. The announced pipeline for the second quarter also remained strong. Noninterest expenses and adjusted costs are lower year-on-year as a result of significantly lower bank levy charges partially offset by higher compensation costs reflecting targeted investments in 2023, including the Numis acquisition. The loan balance increased versus the prior quarter was primarily driven by increased activity in debt origination linked to the recovery seen in the industry this quarter with a smaller increase in financing. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac150 million or 59 basis points of average loans. The increase versus the prior year was driven by an increase in stage 3 impairments primarily in the CRE portfolio. Turning to the Private Bank on Slide 16. We implemented a new reporting structure this quarter, reflecting our client segmentation. For further details, please see Slide 39 in the appendix. The division reported revenues of \u20ac2.4 billion, including higher revenues from Investment Products and Lending, which were more than offset by continued higher funding costs, including the impact of minimum reserve remuneration and the group neutral impact of certain hedging costs now allocated to the business previously in treasury. Sequentially, revenues remained stable, driven by higher revenues from investment products, in line with our strategy to grow commissions and fee income and reflecting seasonality. We saw continued strong business momentum with net inflows into assets under management of \u20ac12 billion, mainly in investment products in Wealth Management and Private Banking, particularly in Germany. Revenues in Personal Banking were impacted by the aforementioned higher funding and hedging costs for our lending books, partially offset by better deposit revenues in Germany. Wealth Management and Private Banking achieved higher revenues from lending and investment products, offset by lower deposit revenues in the international businesses. The Private Bank has continued its transformation with nearly 80 branch closures and headcount reductions of more than 800 in the last 12 months, benefiting from prior investments. Together with normalized investment spend and lower bank levies, these initiatives drove adjusted costs down by 6%. This trajectory includes the impact of higher service remediation costs, which is expected to roll off over the remaining quarters of the year. Pretax profit increased by 24% driven by -- primarily by cost reductions. Provision for credit losses in the quarter was affected by elevated workout activity in Wealth Management as well as continued temporary effects from the operational backlog in Personal Banking. Overall, the quality of our portfolios remains intact. The previous year quarter included single name losses in Wealth Management. Let me continue with Asset Management on Slide 17. My usual reminder, the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Assets under management increased by \u20ac45 billion to \u20ac941 billion in the quarter, a record high. The increase was attributable to positive market appreciation of \u20ac30 billion, net inflows and positive FX effects. Net inflows of \u20ac8 billion were primarily in passive, once again, continuing the positive momentum in X trackers that we've seen throughout last year. The business remains the #2 ETP provider in EMEA by net inflows with growth outpacing the market and hence gaining further market share. Constructive equity markets are influencing investors to switch into passive strategies, but despite this, we've also reported positive net inflows in active products, mainly driven by fixed income and quantitative strategies. Revenues increased by 5% versus the prior year. This was primarily from higher management fees of \u20ac592 million, resulting from higher fees in liquid products due to increasing average assets under management. Noninterest expenses were 5% higher, while adjusted costs were 3% higher than the prior year. Compensation and benefits costs were higher, mainly driven by variable compensation due to DWS' share price increase, while non-compensation costs were effectively flat despite inflationary pressures. Profit before tax has improved by 6% from the prior year period, mainly reflecting higher revenues. The cost income ratio for the quarter was 74%, and return on tangible equity was 14.5%, both improving from the fourth quarter of last year. Moving to Corporate & Other on Slide 18. Corporate & Other reported a pretax loss of \u20ac302 million this quarter versus the equivalent pretax loss of \u20ac208 million in the first quarter of 2023. Revenues were negative \u20ac140 million this quarter, primarily driven by funding and liquidity impacts and other essentially retained items. Valuation and timing differences were positive \u20ac2 million, driven by negative net impacts from interest rate movements offset by partial reversion of prior period losses. This compares to positive \u20ac239 million in the prior year quarter. Pretax loss associated with legacy portfolios was \u20ac96 million, driven primarily by litigation charges and expenses. At the end of the first quarter, risk-weighted assets stood at \u20ac33 billion, including \u20ac12 billion of operational risk RWA. In aggregate, RWAs have reduced by \u20ac11 billion since the prior year quarter. Leverage exposure was \u20ac36 billion at the end of the first quarter, essentially flat to the prior year quarter. Finally, let me turn to the group outlook on Slide 19. The first quarter showed that the expected benefits of our investments are materializing and will help to drive growth in noninterest revenues, while we have limited the downside to our net interest income given our interest rate hedging activity. This demonstrates that our businesses are positioned for future growth, contributing to the delivery of our revenue target of around \u20ac30 billion in 2024. We affirm our target to maintain our quarterly run rate of around \u20ac5 billion of adjusted costs this quarter and around \u20ac20 billion for the full year. We expect provisions for the year to come in at the higher end of our guidance range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans. With our CET1 ratio of 13.4%, we are well positioned, and we'll continue to focus on distributions with a targeted payout ratio of 50% for the financial year 2024. And finally, as Christian said, our full focus remains on our progress through the execution of our strategy and the delivery of our 2035 targets. With that, let me hand back to Ioana, and we look forward to your questions.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you, James. And with that, operator, we're ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan.\nKian Abouhossein: And a shout out to Fabrizio and Ram doing such a great job on gaining market share, especially some -- against some of the European peers that also reported today. Two questions. First of all, on revenues, \u20ac32 billion in 2025. I have talked about in the past. Can you give us a little bit more of a split, how we should think about reaching this target by division in the context of the below \u20ac600 million NII adjustment this year. And then the second question is around cost. \u20ac20 billion of adjusted costs this year, stated \u20ac20 billion next year to get to your cost income target, there's a delta of around \u20ac600 million to \u20ac700 million. If you could please talk about the assumptions that you're making here? And what are the easy wins and what are the difficult ones. And if I may, also the bank levy assumptions for this and next year?\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, Kian, and thank you for your question. Also thank you very much for the shout-out to Fabrizio and Ram. I don't have to do it any more and I even think that we took some market share from the U.S. banks, not only from the European banks, if I think about the performance in the Investment Bank. Look, to your first question, let me tackle that, and James will then go on with the second question and obviously, with further comments to question number one. Let me start actually on the journey in 2024 because it really builds up nicely then to the 2025 story. And it starts really with this good Q1, in my view, across all businesses. And if we now look how the business is progressing, then you can really see that the stable businesses, i.e., the corporate bank, the private bank and asset management that what we have seen in Q1 is actually a good number you can have in your mind also for the following quarters. And one item, which is positive for us, and James can give you some further details is that the NII is actually behaving even better than we thought and that what we have given you earlier this year. So in this regard, there is less headwind on the NII side. And on the fee-generating side, we are actually succeeding there where we wanted to succeed and where the investments are now paying off. You have seen the market share gain in the origination and advisory business. We gained market share by 70 basis points. We have shown a \u20ac500 million revenues in O&A this quarter. To be honest, it's a number which I would also see based on the mandates for Q2, always hard to then go for Q3 and Q4. But with the investments we have done in people but also in Numis, I think that, again, Q1 is a very good marker in the O&A business. We have done, as you said, a very good job in the FIC business. that is far more diversified, far more stable, far more robust. And with all the rating upgrades we have seen, obviously, it also helped to regain clients. And these are structural improvements where I would say this is, on the one hand, clearly supporting our market share gains, but also telling us that these kind of businesses and flow business we are doing there, is likely coming back also in the following quarters. So in a nutshell, if you take Q1 and you have the stability in the 3 business in Asset Management, Private Bank and Corporate Bank, potentially even with some upside in Asset Management. And you see the strong pipeline we have in the O&A business and also the market position we have regained in the FIC business I'm more than confident that we can achieve the \u20ac30 billion, just by adding up these 4 operating businesses based on the starting point we have right now. If I then go into 2025. The first comment is that there is the tailwind in -- on the NII side in the Private Bank. We have always talked about that. We have now for quarters and quarters, gathered assets under management like in Q1 in PB and in Asset Management. And that obviously is driving further revenues there. So the NII tailwind and the benefits from the assets under management growth is driving further the Private Banking revenues in '25 versus '24. Then in the Corporate Bank, actually, there is no NII headwind anymore in '25 versus '24, but we are benefiting from all the mandates which we are getting actually, not only here in Germany, but globally. You have seen in the script, actually, how also in Q1 versus Q1 last year, we actually increased our mandates, which we won with multinational corporates, and that is, again, a momentum, which I can see going forward. So a very stable revenue growth than in the Corporate Bank also next year. In the Investment Bank, to be honest, Kian, I absolutely further expect that we go to at least the 1% market share gain versus that what we had in 2022. We always said that with the investments, which we have done, we want to gain 1% market share. We have done 0.7% in Q1, but there is more to come. And I also do believe that in particular, in the O&A market, there is a further recovery. We can see the momentum in the M&A market, in the ECM market, it is starting, but it's not there where I can see the fee pool is in '25. And then obviously, when I go to the last point in the Asset Management also there, we will benefit, obviously, with the continuous inflow in assets under management. Looking at that, looking at how we have started now Q1, looking at actually the better-than-expected NII trail and that the investments which we have done are paying off. I'm not only confident in the \u20ac30 billion, but then obviously, with the build-out in '25 in the \u20ac32 billion.\nJames von Moltke: So Kian, on expenses, we talk a lot about run rate, monthly quarterly run rates. We're obviously pleased that our focus on delivery achieved the \u20ac5 billion this quarter, we intend to continue that quarter after quarter over the course of this year and managed to an exit rate that puts us on track for our '25 numbers. A couple of moving parts. So first of all, bank levy, we probably expect to book about \u20ac50 million this year. That might be \u20ac150 million next year, but it depends very much on assumptions around what the SRB does growth rates in deposits and the like. Then there's the nonoperating costs. They've run high for the past several years, but we are -- we really think at the tail end of the work we need to do in terms of restructuring and severance, the litigation profile that we've talked about in the past. So I'd love to see that sort of in and around \u20ac300 million to \u20ac400 million in total next year, which would obviously imply a run -- an operating cost level in the high 19s. On a run rate basis, that means we need to be taking expenses down by, say, \u20ac50 million to \u20ac100 million per quarter next year to achieve our numbers. You asked about easy wins. This is all hard work and focus and attention execution. The starting point is really the delivery of the -- we talk about \u20ac1.4 billion of actions that are achieved but not yet in the run rate. The run rate reflects \u20ac1 billion. So there's \u20ac400 million to come that's already executed, which, in reality, makes your difference in terms of the quarterly run rate. So in essence, we just need to crystallize the existing items. In reality, we're going to have some inflation. We're going to have some additional investments that take place, and we then need to offset those with the remaining actions underway, the closing the gap between \u20ac1.4 billion and \u20ac2.5 billion, which is the total target. So the simple version of what's still to be done, it's still day-to-day execution on the glide path of those measures, whether that's branch closures, app decommissioning, headcount reductions, process simplification, front to back on data, all of the things that we've been talking about for some time now are on a glide path for delivery, and we're confident that we're set up to achieve the goals we laid out for this year and next.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Anke Reingen from RBC.\nAnke Reingen: The first one is on capital. Now we start with the 13.4%. And I'm just trying to understand how much room there is for additional buybacks in the course of the year. Is it you're aiming, I guess, you said in the quarterly report aiming for flat, which would be 13.7% or would you be happy with 13.5% as well? And how should we think about potential impact for the rest of the year? Any regulatory headwinds? And how quickly can you deliver on the remaining \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac15 billion of RWA optimization. And then secondly, on loan losses, what does give you the confidence about the decline in the second half? I guess, your commercial real estate, the loss is unchanged, but what's the impact of rates staying higher for longer. Is there any pressure by the regulator to address commercial real estate exposure faster? And also, you mentioned the reversal of the backlog related provisions in the Private Bank, how much is this in terms of -- could be a benefit in the second half?\nChristian Sewing: Thanks, Anke. So look, the target that we've been working to is really a January 1 target with the Basel III impact reflected and a 200 basis point gap to MDA against that. So solve for 13.2% on January 1 with the \u20ac15 billion in it that we've talked about. And really what we have in the balance of the year is earnings, less additional stock buybacks and the impact of business growth, and then from a model methodology, all that stuff, think of that as neutral. We're working through that capital optimization to at least offset those pressures. Q1 is always a quarter where you'll see more burdens on the capital supply side. So I would not look at that as representative of the capital build that earnings can drive. And while Q1 is usually a high point in terms of organic capital generation, we've had a pretty good track record of generating sort of 25 to 30 basis points per quarter over the past several years. So that's sort of the walk that we would outline to you. On the loan losses, the -- we talk about sort of 3 things that are running high in the first quarter. Commercial real estate, which we expect to improve gradually over the year, the collections activity disruption that we expect to also correct and potentially see some recoveries in the second half and equally on the wealth management side. We've had a series of cases over the years where we hope as we move to work out, there may be recoveries there as well against an, I'll call it, underlying strong credit portfolio. So that reversion in the second half is one, but at least based on everything we see at the moment, we have good line of sight on. And so we need to, in essence, compensate for every basis point above 30 today, would need to compensate being below 30 in the second half, but we see the drivers that would drive us there. And lastly, commenting on part of your question, we've had a very deep dive into the commercial real estate portfolio over the last 4, 5, 6 months, sort of name by name and feel comfortable that with the provisions we took in Q1, we reflect the risks that we see in that portfolio. We have, as we mentioned, seen the firming in our portfolio that's visible in some of the market pricing indices and what have you. While that is, to some degree, rates sort of dependent, we do think that we're seeing a floor and are optimistic, at least based on what we see that, that will be preserved over the balance of the year.\nAnke Reingen: And you don't see any pressure by the regulator to take anything faster?\nJames von Moltke: Look, the regulators is very focused. I mean we're obviously careful in how we comment on these things, but the regulator is naturally focused on how the banks broadly defined are managing through a sectoral stress in commercial real estate, not just in the U.S. but globally. So you'd expect them to be paying a great deal of attention and for us as consequently to be looking carefully at our portfolio.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Nicolas Payen from Kepler Cheuvreux.\nNicolas Payen: I have two, please. The first one will be on NII. You mentioned in your people remark that you could exceed your guidance of a decrease of \u20ac600 million in NII this year. And I was wondering what are the conditions to beat this guidance actually? Is it higher rates for longer? Is it stable betas? Is it an improvement on the asset margins, as you mentioned? Any color will be great. And also what kind of magnitude we could expect regarding the betas on this guidance? And the second question would be on incremental share buyback for H2. Have you got any update to give us whether you have applied for this new share buyback with the ECB? Or what kind of discussion you have with the regulators regarding this topic currently.\nJames von Moltke: Thanks, Nicolas. So on the net interest income, I think magnitude, it's early in the year to say, but potentially considerable in 3-digit millions -- easily in 3-digit millions, put it that way. And the drivers are better deposit margins, better deposit volumes, firming loan margins, better funding costs, including unsecured, beta is still running behind. To some extent, the interest curve that you see, the implied forward rates, although as you can also see in our materials, we've hedged a lot of that. But the short answer is that all of those things, the drivers are actually showing favorable compared to our planning with the one exception that goes in the other direction of loan volumes. And there, obviously, we'd like to see a pickup as the economy firms and demand rises. But all of those drivers are playing a role and giving us confidence in the outlook.\nChristian Sewing: Nicolas, on the buybacks, nothing changed from our target, which we gave to the market before. We have clearly stated that shareholder value creation is a key priority for us. And hence, we are fully committed to the plans we have outlined to you, and that also means fully committed that we have a goal to actually distribute beyond the \u20ac8 billion, which we gave you earlier. Now with regard to timing, I think we are doing exactly that what we also said. We always said that we wanted to wait to Q1. We wanted to see that Q1 is running in line with our own plan that we show operating leverage, that we show further increasing revenues, that we have costs under control, exactly this has happened, and that gives us the confidence that we can now obviously also plan for the next steps and go into the discussions. But that is the discussion with the regulator. And that should be always respected. But as I said, we always said Q1 needs to be done. We are happy with Q1 and now we take the next steps.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Giulia Miotto from Morgan Stanley.\nGiulia Miotto: My first question, I go back -- I want to go back to the commercial real estate One thing which surprised me a little bit is that the \u20ac31 billion is now going down, it is going slightly up due to the FX, but I would expect Deutsche Bank to be deleveraging these exposures. So top down, why is that not moving would be my first question. And then secondly, I noticed that your flag litigation is expected up versus 2023. Any comment there.\nJames von Moltke: So Giulia, on the second question, mostly to do with the relatively sizable release we had in the fourth quarter. So I don't necessarily look at it as a deterioration in our position so much as that effect. On CRE, it's essentially a portfolio that through extensions and refinancings is rolling over, FX plays a small role and a very selective new financing activity, typically in lower risk areas that flow into the definition. But it's a rolling portfolio, and I don't -- I wouldn't expect it to diminish dramatically in the next several quarters.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Jeremy Sigee from BNP Paribas Exane.\nJeremy Sigee: Just a couple of follow-ups on topics that have already been touched on. First one, just picking up on CRE again. the modified loan number that you show us, which I think is \u20ac10 billion here, that's been increasing from \u20ac8 billion and \u20ac6 billion over the last couple of quarters. Are you still happy with the nature of those modifications that these are healthy, constructive, they're not just extend and pretend. So is that process still okay as far as you're concerned? That's my first question. And then the second question, again, just kind of picking into the cost point. your adjusted cost ex bank levies were up about 2.5% year-on-year. Is that just noise? Or is that a source of pressure that causes you concern looking at the need to bring costs down as you've discussed. Is that increase year-on-year, any kind of concern to you?\nJames von Moltke: So Jeremy, the modification process, yes, I'd say in short, okay. We've talked about this for a while. As we look at each individual property, we engaged in the discussion with the sponsors on refinancing. Often that includes terms, new equity, sometimes sort of concessions from the banks, and that's as it should be. I don't think of it as a giant extend and pretend process, but a healthy process of managing these assets through a cycle, you should expect the modifications to continue to rise. But if this is a cycle that as we think it is burning itself out, then the provision number as a percentage of that denominator should begin to decline along with the gradual reduction in CLPs on a quarterly basis. And so that's what we would expect to see going forward. A lot of work still lies ahead, but so far, behavior has been rational in light of valuations. On adjusted costs, that increase represents, if you like, the cumulative impact of the various investments we'd be making. We've talked about investments in controls. We've even talked about investments in technology also the front office investments we made last year and now the run rate impact of the Numis transaction as well fully in the quarter. So that increase is there. Is it concerning? No so far as it was deliberate actions and targeted investments on our part. But as per the answer to Kian, now the work needs to be done to take that run rate back down modestly over the next 7 quarters.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Chris Hallam from Goldman Sachs International.\nChris Hallam: Two for me. Just first on NII, and it's a bit of a follow-up to Nicolas question earlier. In your prepared remarks, you sounded at the margin a bit more confident on what you'd expect to see for this year. But if you look into next year, has anything changed for the NII outcome then particularly in light of the moves we've seen in rate expectations in the past couple of months, and also the positive development in deposit funding costs in Germany? And then secondly, so thank you for the extra disclosure on FIC. If I look at the business mix on Slide 30, that's split between EM credit and macro. Is that the right mix of business when you think about the global house bank strategy? Or would you expect that pie chart to change shape meaningfully over the next few years, whether it be through investments or share gains, et cetera?\nJames von Moltke: Yes. Okay. Chris, I'll try both, and Christian you may want to add. So actually, our hope was that we would sound a little bit more confident on this call than in the prepared remarks on the net interest income. We are comfortable with the trajectory, but we're trying not to get too far over our skis on it. We think it's supportive of the trajectory to \u20ac30 billion this year and \u20ac32 billion next year. And the way I -- to be honest, the way this will work, Chris, is the incremental NII that we expected to get in '25 would be compared to the higher base in '24. So that it would essentially just add because of the factors that I outlined being the drivers. So short version. This is incremental in '24 and carries over to '25. The numbers that donut on the -- in the appendix, that does move over time. There's no question. It's depending on the mix shift in the market environment generally. We think we've got a healthy portfolio mix in our, what I'll call fixed markets, FIC markets. We're describing here as FIC ex financing. But it's driven by macro and micro trends, client positioning. It's driven by the extent to which structured transactions are happening in any one of those product areas. So it does move around, but we think of it as a healthy portfolio mix.\nChristian Sewing: Yes. And Chris, I think 2 additional comments. Number one, if you take that over time, actually, we have seen a nice uplift actually in Credit Trading following investments which we have done. And while we wanted to actually have a more balanced portfolio in the FIC ex financing business. And secondly, I would say that going forward, if you think about the global house bank concept and the way how actually Fabrizio is tying up the day-to-day FIC work with the corporate bank, I would say that we have actually a really good chance also with that what is happening on the corporate side and how corporates are thinking that the emerging markets piece and also part of the macro pieces are actually further increasing. We can see that these discussions are happening each and every day. We have an initiative where we are actually targeting corporate within the Corporate Bank and tying them into our FIC businesses, and we can see the results. So I would say that in a normal development and now taking aside the comments James did on unique and particular transactions. But with the network we have, with the global approach we have, I could see that the emerging markets piece and part of the market piece are actually growing because the connection of the IB with the Corporate Bank.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Stefan Styrman from Autonomous.\nStefan Stalmann: I wanted to ask about the private bank, please. You had another very good Flow quarter. I think your annualized growth in Wealth Management and Private Banking is running at around 8% annualized from net new money. And I'm really hard-pressed to come up with any competitor getting close to that kind of growth. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you're doing there? What geographies are driving this, whether they are particular products or any other unique selling points that are explaining this. And a related question, one investor alerted me to a story honest with Media platform this morning, which suggested that FINMA is looking at your wealth management business in Switzerland. Is there anything to flag there? Or is there just nothing\nChristian Sewing: Thank you for your questions. Let me start, and James will amend. Look, on the FINMA side, we gave a clear statement that there is no restriction. And secondly, obviously, I hope you respect that we are not going more into details when it comes to regulatory discussions. But we have said everything in writing. So for us, we can onboard clients. Number two, with regard to Wealth Management and the Private Bank, yes, it has been actually since Claudio has been with us -- it has been always our focus actually to go more into the investment businesses. By the way, not only in Wealth Management, but also in the Private Bank. We see that as a clear growth area and in particular, as a clear long-term growth areas. I think I said it before on these calls. If you think about what is one of the real sticky items also here in Germany going forward, it is what happens with the pensions of our retail clients. And the focus Claudio is giving to the investment businesses, where, obviously, we have an expertise which not a lot of other banks, in particular, in the home market have, is something which is now helping us a lot. It also helps us, by the way, that we got all the rating upgrades that we have a completely different reputation in the market. And the investments Claudio did in Wealth Management outside Germany, in parts of European countries, in particular, in Asia. You know that we invested heavily in the Middle East are now all paying off. And therefore, yes, we are happy with the growth, but it's part of the 2- to 3-year story and strategy, which Claudio built. Now as we see the success in particular in Wealth Management, as I said, we want to bring it more and more into the more Private Bank and Retail Bank business because there is actually the need for the clients. And therefore, I expect actually that we do see these kind of growth rates also going forward, which is again supporting that what I said in the first question from Kian, one should not underestimate the continuous growth in revenues actually in those business from the continuous accumulation of assets under management, in particular, in this business. So a clear focus of Deutsche Bank.\nJames von Moltke: One thing just to add, I think the revenue profile is supportive, as you say, both fee and commission income and the interest income long term in Private Bank. I think the second thing is, as we talked about, the credit loss provisioning right now is more elevated than we would expect it to be sort of on a continuous basis. The last thing to also highlight is this quarter, I think, now shows the trajectory that we're on from a cost perspective with a significant year-on-year cost reduction that we expect to build on in terms of trajectory. So starting to see the restructuring, the technology investments, the distribution platform reductions come through, all of which should significantly enhance the pretax profit margin of PB over time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Hallett from KBW.\nThomas Hallett: So the first one, just curious around the fee progression of the Private Bank. If I look at market levels, they're up sort of 8% on year-on-year. You've had a lot of inflows and yet your revenues in the first quarter haven't really moved much. So if I kind of look at your guidance for the division, it would seem you're expecting quite a bit of a pickup over the next 9 months. So I suppose what is driving that relative to the first quarter? And then secondly, just looking at the financing revenues where you could have really a powerful slide in there in the pack. I mean, look, it's been a major source of growth for you, but also your peers, I'm just curious about what's driving that kind of growth differential kind of versus pre-COVID levels and how sustainable that is? Because I suppose if I look at the leverage consumption of the IB, it's gone up considerably over the last 4 years. So maybe if you could provide a sense of kind of the margins of that business or the capital intensity, that would also be great.\nJames von Moltke: So Tom, I just -- the way you think about fee and commission income in the Private Bank is it's sort of a client business volume measure. So as Christian referred to it as sticky. So as we build balances we build activity. You've seen a year-on-year growth rate of 2%, but now at a level in the first quarter that significantly exceeds any quarter last year, especially the second, third and fourth. And so we think that, that's going to continue to build on itself and create sort of more and more year-on-year differential. There is some amount that obviously depends on clients' investment activity, trading activity, if you like, in any given quarter, but the, call it, the stable revenue base that we're seeing in Private Bank and fee and commission income growth is very encouraging, and I think it's set to continue. I think in terms of your question about resources in the FIC business, we're -- we've been very focused on that sort of consistently over the years. We tend to look at it in terms of revenue production related to RWA. As you can see, market risk RWA relatively modest for us, so it is principally credit risk RWA, both in the balance sheet and derivative businesses. But we think we've got some of the best in the business at understanding and optimizing that. And the same is true of leverage exposure where we manage to the constraints of our balance sheet but work to optimize how we deploy that leverage exposure to support clients as well as the revenue profile. Sometimes, by the way, the business you do is leverage exposure intensive, but not RWA-intensive and sometimes the opposite. And hence, the optimization efforts that we go to there are considerable and sophisticated. So I would stop there. I don't know if you want to add that thing.\nThomas Hallett: Yes. I mean just a follow-up just for myself on the private bank. Is it fair for us to assume that kind of an increased 1.5% year-on-year. Is that something similar we should be expecting for the rest of the year? Or are you more confident on that for the rest of the year?\nChristian Sewing: I think if you look at the prior quarter comparisons year-on-year for both CB and PB, what you'd expect is a relatively significant acceleration of the year-on-year growth in those fee and commission lines in the coming quarters.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the next question comes from Andrew Coombs from Citi.\nAndrew Coombs: I'll also echo the previous remarks, thanks for the additional disclosure on IB revenues as well. Two questions from me. Firstly, on costs, you drew out the FDIC charge in Q4. You haven't drawn out anything in Q1, but I know a number of the U.S. banks did take a top up. So could you just say, is there anything costs for FDIC this quarter as well that you'd like to specify? And then the second question, just on the Corporate and Other division now that's been restated to include the legacy portfolios, I think you've got a loss this quarter, but includes quite a sizable benefit on timing differences or valuation and timing differences. So what should we think of it or what do you think would be usual quarterly run rate for that division going forward?\nJames von Moltke: Thanks, Andrew. So \u20ac8 million is the number this quarter on FDIC by some -- a quirk of accounting, we can't characterize as bank levies, so we don't call it out separately. But it also means if I look at the net going into this quarter's run rate, actually, there were -- there's probably more things pushing it up than pushing it down, of which FDIC was one. There's always some degree of volatility. VNT was a feature this year, certainly, year-on-year in the quarter, it was relatively more neutral. But reflected really changes in the interest rate curve. By the way, some of which we would expect to get back in the balance of the year through pull to par. Always hard to say, therefore, what the pretax profit impact is going to be. We talk in the guidance about what the shareholder expense is that we expect, what the incremental -- what the sort of, call it, run rate or annual treasury funding costs are. So for modeling purposes, I would go with sort of a quarterly version of that annual guidance and accept that there is some volatility in valuation and timing. Incidentally, we've been working over the years to reduce and minimize that volatility to the extent we can. So lots of work has gone into hedge accounting programs and other things to both manage the risks -- the balance sheet risks that we have, but do so in a way that is as accounting neutral as we can, and we've made some good progress in that regard.\nOperator: So it seems there are no further questions at this time. So I would hand back to Ioana Patriniche for any closing remarks.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you, and thank you for joining us and for your questions. As ever, for any follow-up, please come through to the Investor Relations team, and we look forward to speaking to you at our second quarter call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded, and you may disconnect. Thank you for joining, and have a pleasant day. Goodbye.",

        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Thank you, Ioana, and a warm welcome from me. I'm delighted to be discussing our first quarter results with you today. In February, we laid out a clear path to our 2025 objectives for financial performance and capital distributions, and we have delivered in line with our objectives and targets. Group revenues were \u20ac7.8 billion. This reflects business growth and franchise momentum, particularly in areas where we have been investing like our capital-light businesses, while net interest income was more resilient than expected. This performance underlines the benefit of our complementary business mix. We are delivering on our cost targets. Adjusted costs were in line with our commitment to a quarterly run rate of around \u20ac5 billion for this year. Provision for credit losses remained elevated this quarter, but in line with our expectations and prior guidance, considering where we are in the credit cycle. Portfolio quality remains very solid, and we continue to expect provisions for the year to be at the higher end of our guidance range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans. Our return on tangible equity was 8.7% in the first quarter, up from 8.3% in the first quarter last year. Capital remains robust. Our CET1 ratio was 13.4%, enabling us to remain on track in raising distributions through shareholders and supporting business growth. Let me unpack some of the drivers of our first quarter results on Slide 2. Pre-provision profit was up by 11% year-on-year to \u20ac2.5 billion and more than 20% higher since we launched our global house bank strategy. This reflected continued progress on driving operating leverage, which is a core element of our strategy execution. We increased revenues in our operating divisions by 3% year-on-year, while group revenues were up 1% on a reported basis. Group revenues include Corporate and Other, which tends to add some level of volatility into our revenue line. As committed, we delivered growth in noninterest revenues and saw an increase of 11% year-on-year in commissions and fee income, mainly in divisions where we made investments last year. As expected, our reported net interest income declined this quarter, but net interest income remained stable in our banking books, and James will shortly talk you through this in more detail. We reduced adjusted costs by 6% year-on-year and 5% sequentially to around \u20ac5 billion, in line with our guidance. This includes bank levies and higher compensation costs, which James will discuss later. Now let's look at the franchise achievements across all divisions on Slide 3. The Corporate Bank delivered strong business growth with a 5% increase in incremental deals won with multinational corporate clients compared to the prior year quarter. We closed a series of landmark project finance transactions and saw strong momentum across the structured credit market and trust and agency services. We also ranked #1 in 17 categories in the 2024 Euromoney Trade Finance survey, including being the best trade finance bank in Western Europe for the seventh consecutive year. Demonstrating the strength of our business model, the Investment Bank delivered a strong quarter with notable advances across the franchise. Investments in talent boosted our origination and advisory market share to 2.6%, a 70 basis point increase compared to the full year 2023 with notable gains in LDCM and DCM, elevating our global ranking from 11th to 7th. Our advisory franchise benefited from the breadth of our product set in the quarter. In GTCR's acquisition of Worldpay, we provided an integrated offering from financial advice to debt financing through to FX and rate hedging. The revenue increase in FIC was driven by both financing and our well-balanced business portfolio, which supports our revenue profile through the cycle. We maintained our strength in credit trading driven by our investments in 2023, particularly in the flow business, and we also grew revenues in the Americas. These developments further diversified revenue mix in our portfolio. The Private Bank benefited from our investments, accelerated business momentum delivered \u20ac12 billion of net inflows in the first quarter, which makes it 17 consecutive quarters of net inflows bringing the total assets under management to \u20ac606 billion with a strategic shift towards fee-generating investment solutions. We also continue to strengthen capabilities in strategic areas by increasing coverage of ultra-high net worth individuals in Germany and enhanced offering of investment solutions including third-party exclusive collaborations, which should drive further inflows. Asset Management delivered another strong quarter of volume growth. Net inflows were \u20ac9 billion ex cash, helping assets under management grew by \u20ac45 billion to \u20ac941 billion, over \u20ac100 billion higher than in the prior year quarter, which we expect to support future revenue generation. Now let me turn to the progress against our strategic objectives on Slide 4. Starting with revenues. We have delivered a compound annual growth rate of 6% since 2021 in line with our raised target range of 5.5% to 6.5% from 2021 to 2025. As promised, we grew mainly in capital-light businesses with strong growth in origination and advisory as well as in the Private Bank and in Asset Management, supported by high inflows of assets under management, underlying our franchise momentum. We aim to build on these developments as our franchise expense following our investments in growth initiatives across all business segments. With net interest income resilient at the start of the year and growth in noninterest revenues, we feel we are well on our way to our 2025 revenue ambitions. We continue to deliver on our \u20ac2.5 billion operational efficiency program. We have completed measures, which delivered our expected savings of \u20ac1.4 billion, nearly 60% of our target with around \u20ac1 billion in savings already realized. The incremental efficiencies this quarter were driven by optimization of our business in Germany and reshaping of our workforce and non-client-facing roads. We have further incremental measures already underway, including reengineering of our operating model via additional front-to-back improvements of product processes and harmonization of infrastructure capabilities. This gives us full confidence that we will deliver on our commitment of a quarterly run rate of adjusted cost of around \u20ac5 billion in 2024 and total cost of around \u20ac20 billion in 2025. Finally, on capital efficiency, we achieved a further \u20ac2 billion reduction in RWAs, bringing aggregate reductions to \u20ac15 billion. As we are intensifying our work on capital efficiency with further reductions coming from data and process improvements as well as securitization, we remain highly confident that we can meet our target range of \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion. Let me conclude with a few words on our strategy on Slide 5. In a nutshell, we delivered on all key initiatives and targets in the first quarter. And as we progress on our global house bank strategy, we are on the right path for both our clients and our shareholders. First, we have a strong and growing franchise. Clients come to us as our well-balanced, complementary businesses provide them with full service products and solutions. This supports our revenue growth through different market cycles and drive our market share. And as we said consistently, Clients want a partner that offers them an alternative to large U.S. banks, a partner with our expertise, product range and global network. Second, we continue to improve our operational efficiency. We are maintaining our cost discipline. And as always, we are committed to our approach of self-funding our investments. 2023 marked the peak of our investments, but we continue to invest to reduce the complexity of our organization through improving technology, processes and control capabilities. Finally, we are absolutely focused on creating value for our shareholders. And as we said in previous quarters, we are fully committed to increasing shareholder distributions as rewarding our shareholders is a top priority. We are confident we can increase distributions well beyond our original goal of \u20ac8 billion in respect of the financial year 2021 to 2025, and we expect to continue to grow dividends and make incremental share buybacks. With that, let me hand over to James."

        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Thank you, Christian. Let me start with a few key performance indicators on Slide 7 and place them in the context of our 2025 targets. Christian mentioned our continued business momentum, which resulted in revenue growth of 6% on a compound basis for the last 12 months relative to 2021, the midpoint of our recently upgraded revenue growth target range. The cost/income ratio of 68% in the first quarter shows a 7 percentage point improvement against 2023, driven by operating leverage from sustained revenue growth and cost management. Our return on tangible common equity was 8.7% for the first quarter. Our capital position remained robust with the CET1 ratio at 13.4% this quarter after absorbing the impact of the share repurchase and the deduction for future distributions in line with revised EBA rules, reflecting our payout ratio policy. Our liquidity metrics also remained strong. The liquidity coverage ratio was 136%, above our target of around 130% and the net stable funding ratio was 123%. In short, our performance in the period reaffirms our resilience and our confidence in reaching our 2025 targets. With that, let me turn to the first quarter highlights on Slide 8. Group revenues were \u20ac7.8 billion, up 1% on the first quarter of 2023 or 2%, excluding specific items. Noninterest expenses were \u20ac5.3 billion, down 3% year-on-year. Nonoperating costs this quarter included litigation charges of \u20ac166 million and \u20ac95 million of restructuring and severance charges. Adjusted costs decreased 6% year-on-year, mainly due to lower bank levies. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac439 million or 37 basis points of average loans, and I will discuss this in more detail shortly. We generated a profit before tax of \u20ac2 billion, up 10% year-on-year and a net profit of \u20ac1.5 billion, also up 10% compared to the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share was \u20ac0.69 in the first quarter and tangible book value per share was \u20ac29.26, up 7% year-on-year. Our tax rate in the quarter was 29%. Let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results. Let me start with a review of our net interest income on Slide 9. Net interest income for the group decreased by approximately \u20ac100 million compared to the previous quarter with the reduction being driven by accounting effects. As a reminder, these effects are revenue-neutral at the group level as the decrease in NII is offset by an increase in noninterest revenues. Excluding these accounting effects, banking book NII was essentially flat as the decline in the private bank was offset by an increase in the corporate bank and lower funding costs in the Investment Bank and Corporate and Other. The reduction in the Private Bank net interest margin was largely driven by the non-recurrence of favorable episodic effects in the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as the ongoing impact of beta normalization. On an absolute basis, net interest income in the Private Bank is in line with the plans on which our NII guidance from last quarter was based. The increase in corporate bank NII was due to a positive one-off impact from a CLO recovery, which was accounted as NII with deposit betas showing a steady increase in line with our assumptions. We expect to see a corporate bank NII decline in the coming quarters as betas continue to normalize. NII in fixed financing was essentially flat quarter-on-quarter. We're starting to see margin expansion on the asset side, which if it continues, will help offset margin compression from beta normalization. In summary, the development in the first quarter reinforces our expectation that we will meet or improve on our prior guidance of a \u20ac600 million reduction in banking book NII for 2024 relative to the prior year. With that, let's turn to adjusted cost development on Slide 10. Adjusted costs were around \u20ac5 billion for the quarter, specifically \u20ac5.02 billion, excluding bank levies, up 3% year-on-year, but down 4% sequentially, in line with our guidance. We were disciplined in most expense categories and the modest increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefit costs, reflecting inflationary pressures on fixed remunerations and increases in internal workforce after our targeted investments in talent throughout 2023 and higher performance-related compensation. The increase in compensation and benefit costs was partially offset by workforce optimization. Let's now turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 11. Provision for credit losses in the first quarter was \u20ac439 million, equivalent to 37 basis points of average loans. The decline compared to the previous quarter was driven by moderate stage 1 and 2 releases of \u20ac32 million due to improved macroeconomic forecast and model recalibration effects, which occurred in the prior quarter. Stage 3 provisions at \u20ac471 million remained elevated at a similar level to the previous quarter. This included continued weakness in the commercial real estate sector, mainly impacting the Investment Bank and the continued impact of operational backlogs in the Private Bank. Our full year guidance for provisions is unchanged at the higher end of the range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans. This reflects our expectation that provisions will remain elevated in the first half of the year and should gradually reduce in the second half. The decline is expected to be driven by an improvement in the credit commercial real estate sector and the partial reversal of backlog-related provisions in the Private Bank. Before we move to performance in our businesses, let me turn to capital on Slide 12. Our first quarter common equity Tier 1 ratio came in at 13.4% compared to 13.7% at year-end 2023. We had a strong capital supply this quarter and the sequential decline was driven by our distribution actions and plans together with business growth. 19 basis points of the decrease reflects the ECB approval for our \u20ac675 million share buyback, which we commenced in March. Half of the first quarter net income was deducted for future capital distributions in line with our 50% payout ratio guidance, with the remainder supporting other deductions. 12 basis points of the decrease came from RWA growth. The increase in RWA is net of reductions due to RWA optimization achieved during the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, our leverage ratio was 4.5%, 8 basis points lower compared to the previous quarter. The decline was primarily driven by lower Tier 1 capital in line with the movement in CET1 capital, with leverage exposure broadly unchanged. With that, let's now turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 14. Corporate Bank revenues in the first quarter were \u20ac1.9 billion, essentially flat sequentially and 5% lower compared to the prior year quarter, which marked the revenue peak of the current rate cycle. Year-on-year, the revenue decrease reflected the normalization of deposit revenues, lower loan net interest income and the discontinuation of remuneration of minimum reserves by the ECB predominantly impacting our corporate treasury services businesses, partly offset by 3% higher commissions and fee income. On a sequential basis, the revenue of development mainly reflected lower overnight NII. Loans declined by \u20ac5 billion compared to the prior year quarter and remained flat sequentially, reflecting muted demand and our continued selective balance sheet deployment. Deposits were \u20ac31 billion higher year-on-year and over \u20ac10 billion higher than the fourth quarter, mainly driven by higher term deposits. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac63 million or 22 basis points of average loans, essentially flat versus the prior year, reflecting resilience of the corporate loan book. Noninterest expenses decreased sequentially driven by lower internal service cost allocations and the FDIC special assessment charge in the prior quarter, but increased year-on-year due to higher litigation costs. This resulted in a post-tax return on tangible equity of 15.4% and a cost income ratio of 64%. I'll now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 15. Revenues for the first quarter were 13% higher year-on-year on a reported basis or 14% when excluding specific items. Revenues in fixed income and currencies increased by 7% versus the prior year quarter demonstrating the underlying diversification of the business. Financing performance was solid with revenues up 14% year-on-year, reflecting a robust carry profile and strong levels of issuance and securitization fees. As this is the first time we are disclosing financing revenue separately, you can find further information on the composition of the business in the appendix on Slide 38. Credit trading revenues were again significantly higher year-on-year as the business continued to build on the successful execution of our strategic initiatives and investments made through 2023, specifically in the Flow business. Emerging Markets revenues were also significantly higher, with revenues up across all 3 regions. Client activity was up year-on-year, aided by the investments in Latin America. Foreign Exchange revenues were significantly higher, benefiting from the non-repeat of the interest rate market dislocation seen in the prior year. The impact of a refocused business model with investments into controls and technology are also beginning to materialize and collaboration with the wider franchise is driving cross-sell revenues in the quarter. Rates revenues were significantly lower when compared to a very strong prior year quarter and reflected a reduction in market volatility. Moving to Origination and Advisory, revenues were up 54% when compared to the prior year quarter, with the business gaining market share in a growing fee pool environment, both year-on-year and versus the prior quarter. Debt Origination revenues were significantly higher, benefiting from a material improvement in the leveraged debt market conditions. While investment-grade debt issuance activity was also higher year-on-year. Advisory revenues increased versus the prior year despite a reduction in the industry fee pool. The announced pipeline for the second quarter also remained strong. Noninterest expenses and adjusted costs are lower year-on-year as a result of significantly lower bank levy charges partially offset by higher compensation costs reflecting targeted investments in 2023, including the Numis acquisition. The loan balance increased versus the prior quarter was primarily driven by increased activity in debt origination linked to the recovery seen in the industry this quarter with a smaller increase in financing. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac150 million or 59 basis points of average loans. The increase versus the prior year was driven by an increase in stage 3 impairments primarily in the CRE portfolio. Turning to the Private Bank on Slide 16. We implemented a new reporting structure this quarter, reflecting our client segmentation. For further details, please see Slide 39 in the appendix. The division reported revenues of \u20ac2.4 billion, including higher revenues from Investment Products and Lending, which were more than offset by continued higher funding costs, including the impact of minimum reserve remuneration and the group neutral impact of certain hedging costs now allocated to the business previously in treasury. Sequentially, revenues remained stable, driven by higher revenues from investment products, in line with our strategy to grow commissions and fee income and reflecting seasonality. We saw continued strong business momentum with net inflows into assets under management of \u20ac12 billion, mainly in investment products in Wealth Management and Private Banking, particularly in Germany. Revenues in Personal Banking were impacted by the aforementioned higher funding and hedging costs for our lending books, partially offset by better deposit revenues in Germany. Wealth Management and Private Banking achieved higher revenues from lending and investment products, offset by lower deposit revenues in the international businesses. The Private Bank has continued its transformation with nearly 80 branch closures and headcount reductions of more than 800 in the last 12 months, benefiting from prior investments. Together with normalized investment spend and lower bank levies, these initiatives drove adjusted costs down by 6%. This trajectory includes the impact of higher service remediation costs, which is expected to roll off over the remaining quarters of the year. Pretax profit increased by 24% driven by -- primarily by cost reductions. Provision for credit losses in the quarter was affected by elevated workout activity in Wealth Management as well as continued temporary effects from the operational backlog in Personal Banking. Overall, the quality of our portfolios remains intact. The previous year quarter included single name losses in Wealth Management. Let me continue with Asset Management on Slide 17. My usual reminder, the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Assets under management increased by \u20ac45 billion to \u20ac941 billion in the quarter, a record high. The increase was attributable to positive market appreciation of \u20ac30 billion, net inflows and positive FX effects. Net inflows of \u20ac8 billion were primarily in passive, once again, continuing the positive momentum in X trackers that we've seen throughout last year. The business remains the #2 ETP provider in EMEA by net inflows with growth outpacing the market and hence gaining further market share. Constructive equity markets are influencing investors to switch into passive strategies, but despite this, we've also reported positive net inflows in active products, mainly driven by fixed income and quantitative strategies. Revenues increased by 5% versus the prior year. This was primarily from higher management fees of \u20ac592 million, resulting from higher fees in liquid products due to increasing average assets under management. Noninterest expenses were 5% higher, while adjusted costs were 3% higher than the prior year. Compensation and benefits costs were higher, mainly driven by variable compensation due to DWS' share price increase, while non-compensation costs were effectively flat despite inflationary pressures. Profit before tax has improved by 6% from the prior year period, mainly reflecting higher revenues. The cost income ratio for the quarter was 74%, and return on tangible equity was 14.5%, both improving from the fourth quarter of last year. Moving to Corporate & Other on Slide 18. Corporate & Other reported a pretax loss of \u20ac302 million this quarter versus the equivalent pretax loss of \u20ac208 million in the first quarter of 2023. Revenues were negative \u20ac140 million this quarter, primarily driven by funding and liquidity impacts and other essentially retained items. Valuation and timing differences were positive \u20ac2 million, driven by negative net impacts from interest rate movements offset by partial reversion of prior period losses. This compares to positive \u20ac239 million in the prior year quarter. Pretax loss associated with legacy portfolios was \u20ac96 million, driven primarily by litigation charges and expenses. At the end of the first quarter, risk-weighted assets stood at \u20ac33 billion, including \u20ac12 billion of operational risk RWA. In aggregate, RWAs have reduced by \u20ac11 billion since the prior year quarter. Leverage exposure was \u20ac36 billion at the end of the first quarter, essentially flat to the prior year quarter. Finally, let me turn to the group outlook on Slide 19. The first quarter showed that the expected benefits of our investments are materializing and will help to drive growth in noninterest revenues, while we have limited the downside to our net interest income given our interest rate hedging activity. This demonstrates that our businesses are positioned for future growth, contributing to the delivery of our revenue target of around \u20ac30 billion in 2024. We affirm our target to maintain our quarterly run rate of around \u20ac5 billion of adjusted costs this quarter and around \u20ac20 billion for the full year. We expect provisions for the year to come in at the higher end of our guidance range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans. With our CET1 ratio of 13.4%, we are well positioned, and we'll continue to focus on distributions with a targeted payout ratio of 50% for the financial year 2024. And finally, as Christian said, our full focus remains on our progress through the execution of our strategy and the delivery of our 2035 targets. With that, let me hand back to Ioana, and we look forward to your questions."

First of all, on revenues, \u20ac32 billion in 2025. I have talked about in the past. Can you give us a little bit more of a split, how we should think about reaching this target by division in the context of the below \u20ac600 million NII adjustment this year. And then the second question is around cost. \u20ac20 billion of adjusted costs this year, stated \u20ac20 billion next year to get to your cost income target, there's a delta of around \u20ac600 million to \u20ac700 million. If you could please talk about the assumptions that you're making here? And what are the easy wins and what are the difficult ones. And if I may, also the bank levy assumptions for this and next year?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Thank you, Kian, and thank you for your question. Also thank you very much for the shout-out to Fabrizio and Ram. I don't have to do it any more and I even think that we took some market share from the U.S. banks, not only from the European banks, if I think about the performance in the Investment Bank. Look, to your first question, let me tackle that, and James will then go on with the second question and obviously, with further comments to question number one. Let me start actually on the journey in 2024 because it really builds up nicely then to the 2025 story. And it starts really with this good Q1, in my view, across all businesses. And if we now look how the business is progressing, then you can really see that the stable businesses, i.e., the corporate bank, the private bank and asset management that what we have seen in Q1 is actually a good number you can have in your mind also for the following quarters. And one item, which is positive for us, and James can give you some further details is that the NII is actually behaving even better than we thought and that what we have given you earlier this year. So in this regard, there is less headwind on the NII side. And on the fee-generating side, we are actually succeeding there where we wanted to succeed and where the investments are now paying off. You have seen the market share gain in the origination and advisory business. We gained market share by 70 basis points. We have shown a \u20ac500 million revenues in O&A this quarter. To be honest, it's a number which I would also see based on the mandates for Q2, always hard to then go for Q3 and Q4. But with the investments we have done in people but also in Numis, I think that, again, Q1 is a very good marker in the O&A business. We have done, as you said, a very good job in the FIC business. that is far more diversified, far more stable, far more robust. And with all the rating upgrades we have seen, obviously, it also helped to regain clients. And these are structural improvements where I would say this is, on the one hand, clearly supporting our market share gains, but also telling us that these kind of businesses and flow business we are doing there, is likely coming back also in the following quarters. So in a nutshell, if you take Q1 and you have the stability in the 3 business in Asset Management, Private Bank and Corporate Bank, potentially even with some upside in Asset Management. And you see the strong pipeline we have in the O&A business and also the market position we have regained in the FIC business I'm more than confident that we can achieve the \u20ac30 billion, just by adding up these 4 operating businesses based on the starting point we have right now. If I then go into 2025. The first comment is that there is the tailwind in -- on the NII side in the Private Bank. We have always talked about that. We have now for quarters and quarters, gathered assets under management like in Q1 in PB and in Asset Management. And that obviously is driving further revenues there. So the NII tailwind and the benefits from the assets under management growth is driving further the Private Banking revenues in '25 versus '24. Then in the Corporate Bank, actually, there is no NII headwind anymore in '25 versus '24, but we are benefiting from all the mandates which we are getting actually, not only here in Germany, but globally. You have seen in the script, actually, how also in Q1 versus Q1 last year, we actually increased our mandates, which we won with multinational corporates, and that is, again, a momentum, which I can see going forward. So a very stable revenue growth than in the Corporate Bank also next year. In the Investment Bank, to be honest, Kian, I absolutely further expect that we go to at least the 1% market share gain versus that what we had in 2022. We always said that with the investments, which we have done, we want to gain 1% market share. We have done 0.7% in Q1, but there is more to come. And I also do believe that in particular, in the O&A market, there is a further recovery. We can see the momentum in the M&A market, in the ECM market, it is starting, but it's not there where I can see the fee pool is in '25. And then obviously, when I go to the last point in the Asset Management also there, we will benefit, obviously, with the continuous inflow in assets under management. Looking at that, looking at how we have started now Q1, looking at actually the better-than-expected NII trail and that the investments which we have done are paying off. I'm not only confident in the \u20ac30 billion, but then obviously, with the build-out in '25 in the \u20ac32 billion."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "So Kian, on expenses, we talk a lot about run rate, monthly quarterly run rates. We're obviously pleased that our focus on delivery achieved the \u20ac5 billion this quarter, we intend to continue that quarter after quarter over the course of this year and managed to an exit rate that puts us on track for our '25 numbers. A couple of moving parts. So first of all, bank levy, we probably expect to book about \u20ac50 million this year. That might be \u20ac150 million next year, but it depends very much on assumptions around what the SRB does growth rates in deposits and the like. Then there's the nonoperating costs. They've run high for the past several years, but we are -- we really think at the tail end of the work we need to do in terms of restructuring and severance, the litigation profile that we've talked about in the past. So I'd love to see that sort of in and around \u20ac300 million to \u20ac400 million in total next year, which would obviously imply a run -- an operating cost level in the high 19s. On a run rate basis, that means we need to be taking expenses down by, say, \u20ac50 million to \u20ac100 million per quarter next year to achieve our numbers. You asked about easy wins. This is all hard work and focus and attention execution. The starting point is really the delivery of the -- we talk about \u20ac1.4 billion of actions that are achieved but not yet in the run rate. The run rate reflects \u20ac1 billion. So there's \u20ac400 million to come that's already executed, which, in reality, makes your difference in terms of the quarterly run rate. So in essence, we just need to crystallize the existing items. In reality, we're going to have some inflation. We're going to have some additional investments that take place, and we then need to offset those with the remaining actions underway, the closing the gap between \u20ac1.4 billion and \u20ac2.5 billion, which is the total target. So the simple version of what's still to be done, it's still day-to-day execution on the glide path of those measures, whether that's branch closures, app decommissioning, headcount reductions, process simplification, front to back on data, all of the things that we've been talking about for some time now are on a glide path for delivery, and we're confident that we're set up to achieve the goals we laid out for this year and next."

      {
        "speaker": "Anke Reingen",
        "text": "The first one is on capital. Now we start with the 13.4%. And I'm just trying to understand how much room there is for additional buybacks in the course of the year. Is it you're aiming, I guess, you said in the quarterly report aiming for flat, which would be 13.7% or would you be happy with 13.5% as well? And how should we think about potential impact for the rest of the year? Any regulatory headwinds? And how quickly can you deliver on the remaining \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac15 billion of RWA optimization. And then secondly, on loan losses, what does give you the confidence about the decline in the second half? I guess, your commercial real estate, the loss is unchanged, but what's the impact of rates staying higher for longer. Is there any pressure by the regulator to address commercial real estate exposure faster? And also, you mentioned the reversal of the backlog related provisions in the Private Bank, how much is this in terms of -- could be a benefit in the second half?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Thanks, Anke. So look, the target that we've been working to is really a January 1 target with the Basel III impact reflected and a 200 basis point gap to MDA against that. So solve for 13.2% on January 1 with the \u20ac15 billion in it that we've talked about. And really what we have in the balance of the year is earnings, less additional stock buybacks and the impact of business growth, and then from a model methodology, all that stuff, think of that as neutral. We're working through that capital optimization to at least offset those pressures. Q1 is always a quarter where you'll see more burdens on the capital supply side. So I would not look at that as representative of the capital build that earnings can drive. And while Q1 is usually a high point in terms of organic capital generation, we've had a pretty good track record of generating sort of 25 to 30 basis points per quarter over the past several years. So that's sort of the walk that we would outline to you. On the loan losses, the -- we talk about sort of 3 things that are running high in the first quarter. Commercial real estate, which we expect to improve gradually over the year, the collections activity disruption that we expect to also correct and potentially see some recoveries in the second half and equally on the wealth management side. We've had a series of cases over the years where we hope as we move to work out, there may be recoveries there as well against an, I'll call it, underlying strong credit portfolio. So that reversion in the second half is one, but at least based on everything we see at the moment, we have good line of sight on. And so we need to, in essence, compensate for every basis point above 30 today, would need to compensate being below 30 in the second half, but we see the drivers that would drive us there. And lastly, commenting on part of your question, we've had a very deep dive into the commercial real estate portfolio over the last 4, 5, 6 months, sort of name by name and feel comfortable that with the provisions we took in Q1, we reflect the risks that we see in that portfolio. We have, as we mentioned, seen the firming in our portfolio that's visible in some of the market pricing indices and what have you. While that is, to some degree, rates sort of dependent, we do think that we're seeing a floor and are optimistic, at least based on what we see that, that will be preserved over the balance of the year."

And I was wondering what are the conditions to beat this guidance actually? Is it higher rates for longer? Is it stable betas? Is it an improvement on the asset margins, as you mentioned? Any color will be great. And also what kind of magnitude we could expect regarding the betas on this guidance? And the second question would be on incremental share buyback for H2. Have you got any update to give us whether you have applied for this new share buyback with the ECB? Or what kind of discussion you have with the regulators regarding this topic currently."

        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Thanks, Nicolas. So on the net interest income, I think magnitude, it's early in the year to say, but potentially considerable in 3-digit millions -- easily in 3-digit millions, put it that way. And the drivers are better deposit margins, better deposit volumes, firming loan margins, better funding costs, including unsecured, beta is still running behind. To some extent, the interest curve that you see, the implied forward rates, although as you can also see in our materials, we've hedged a lot of that. But the short answer is that all of those things, the drivers are actually showing favorable compared to our planning with the one exception that goes in the other direction of loan volumes. And there, obviously, we'd like to see a pickup as the economy firms and demand rises. But all of those drivers are playing a role and giving us confidence in the outlook."

And hence, we are fully committed to the plans we have outlined to you, and that also means fully committed that we have a goal to actually distribute beyond the \u20ac8 billion, which we gave you earlier. Now with regard to timing, I think we are doing exactly that what we also said. We always said that we wanted to wait to Q1. We wanted to see that Q1 is running in line with our own plan that we show operating leverage, that we show further increasing revenues, that we have costs under control, exactly this has happened, and that gives us the confidence that we can now obviously also plan for the next steps and go into the discussions. But that is the discussion with the regulator. And that should be always respected. But as I said, we always said Q1 needs to be done. We are happy with Q1 and now we take the next steps."

On CRE, it's essentially a portfolio that through extensions and refinancings is rolling over, FX plays a small role and a very selective new financing activity, typically in lower risk areas that flow into the definition.

First one, just picking up on CRE again. the modified loan number that you show us, which I think is \u20ac10 billion here, that's been increasing from \u20ac8 billion and \u20ac6 billion over the last couple of quarters. Are you still happy with the nature of those modifications that these are healthy, constructive, they're not just extend and pretend. So is that process still okay as far as you're concerned? That's my first question. And then the second question, again, just kind of picking into the cost point. your adjusted cost ex bank levies were up about 2.5% year-on-year. Is that just noise? Or is that a source of pressure that causes you concern looking at the need to bring costs down as you've discussed. Is that increase year-on-year, any kind of concern to you?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "So Jeremy, the modification process, yes, I'd say in short, okay. We've talked about this for a while. As we look at each individual property, we engaged in the discussion with the sponsors on refinancing. Often that includes terms, new equity, sometimes sort of concessions from the banks, and that's as it should be. I don't think of it as a giant extend and pretend process, but a healthy process of managing these assets through a cycle, you should expect the modifications to continue to rise. But if this is a cycle that as we think it is burning itself out, then the provision number as a percentage of that denominator should begin to decline along with the gradual reduction in CLPs on a quarterly basis. And so that's what we would expect to see going forward. A lot of work still lies ahead, but so far, behavior has been rational in light of valuations. On adjusted costs, that increase represents, if you like, the cumulative impact of the various investments we'd be making. We've talked about investments in controls. We've even talked about investments in technology also the front office investments we made last year and now the run rate impact of the Numis transaction as well fully in the quarter. So that increase is there. Is it concerning? No so far as it was deliberate actions and targeted investments on our part. But as per the answer to Kian, now the work needs to be done to take that run rate back down modestly over the next 7 quarters."

In your prepared remarks, you sounded at the margin a bit more confident on what you'd expect to see for this year. But if you look into next year, has anything changed for the NII outcome then particularly in light of the moves we've seen in rate expectations in the past couple of months, and also the positive development in deposit funding costs in Germany? And then secondly, so thank you for the extra disclosure on FIC. If I look at the business mix on Slide 30, that's split between EM credit and macro. Is that the right mix of business when you think about the global house bank strategy? Or would you expect that pie chart to change shape meaningfully over the next few years, whether it be through investments or share gains, et cetera?"

So actually, our hope was that we would sound a little bit more confident on this call than in the prepared remarks on the net interest income. We are comfortable with the trajectory, but we're trying not to get too far over our skis on it. We think it's supportive of the trajectory to \u20ac30 billion this year and \u20ac32 billion next year. And the way I -- to be honest, the way this will work, Chris, is the incremental NII that we expected to get in '25 would be compared to the higher base in '24. So that it would essentially just add because of the factors that I outlined being the drivers. So short version. This is incremental in '24 and carries over to '25. The numbers that donut on the -- in the appendix, that does move over time. There's no question. It's depending on the mix shift in the market environment generally. We think we've got a healthy portfolio mix in our, what I'll call fixed markets, FIC markets. We're describing here as FIC ex financing. But it's driven by macro and micro trends, client positioning. It's driven by the extent to which structured transactions are happening in any one of those product areas. So it does move around, but we think of it as a healthy portfolio mix."

Number one, if you take that over time, actually, we have seen a nice uplift actually in Credit Trading following investments which we have done. And while we wanted to actually have a more balanced portfolio in the FIC ex financing business. And secondly, I would say that going forward, if you think about the global house bank concept and the way how actually Fabrizio is tying up the day-to-day FIC work with the corporate bank, I would say that we have actually a really good chance also with that what is happening on the corporate side and how corporates are thinking that the emerging markets piece and also part of the macro pieces are actually further increasing. We can see that these discussions are happening each and every day. We have an initiative where we are actually targeting corporate within the Corporate Bank and tying them into our FIC businesses, and we can see the results. So I would say that in a normal development and now taking aside the comments James did on unique and particular transactions. But with the network we have, with the global approach we have, I could see that the emerging markets piece and part of the market piece are actually growing because the connection of the IB with the Corporate Bank."

Number two, with regard to Wealth Management and the Private Bank, yes, it has been actually since Claudio has been with us -- it has been always our focus actually to go more into the investment businesses. By the way, not only in Wealth Management, but also in the Private Bank. We see that as a clear growth area and in particular, as a clear long-term growth areas. I think I said it before on these calls. If you think about what is one of the real sticky items also here in Germany going forward, it is what happens with the pensions of our retail clients.

It also helps us, by the way, that we got all the rating upgrades that we have a completely different reputation in the market. And the investments Claudio did in Wealth Management outside Germany, in parts of European countries, in particular, in Asia. You know that we invested heavily in the Middle East are now all paying off. And therefore, yes, we are happy with the growth, but it's part of the 2- to 3-year story and strategy, which Claudio built. Now as we see the success in particular in Wealth Management, as I said, we want to bring it more and more into the more Private Bank and Retail Bank business because there is actually the need for the clients. And therefore, I expect actually that we do see these kind of growth rates also going forward, which is again supporting that what I said in the first question from Kian, one should not underestimate the continuous growth in revenues actually in those business from the continuous accumulation of assets under management, in particular, in this business. So a clear focus of Deutsche Bank."

        "text": "One thing just to add, I think the revenue profile is supportive, as you say, both fee and commission income and the interest income long term in Private Bank. I think the second thing is, as we talked about, the credit loss provisioning right now is more elevated than we would expect it to be sort of on a continuous basis. The last thing to also highlight is this quarter, I think, now shows the trajectory that we're on from a cost perspective with a significant year-on-year cost reduction that we expect to build on in terms of trajectory. So starting to see the restructuring, the technology investments, the distribution platform reductions come through, all of which should significantly enhance the pretax profit margin of PB over time."

        "text": "So the first one, just curious around the fee progression of the Private Bank. If I look at market levels, they're up sort of 8% on year-on-year. You've had a lot of inflows and yet your revenues in the first quarter haven't really moved much. So if I kind of look at your guidance for the division, it would seem you're expecting quite a bit of a pickup over the next 9 months. So I suppose what is driving that relative to the first quarter? And then secondly, just looking at the financing revenues where you could have really a powerful slide in there in the pack. I mean, look, it's been a major source of growth for you, but also your peers, I'm just curious about what's driving that kind of growth differential kind of versus pre-COVID levels and how sustainable that is? Because I suppose if I look at the leverage consumption of the IB, it's gone up considerably over the last 4 years. So maybe if you could provide a sense of kind of the margins of that business or the capital intensity, that would also be great."

        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "So Tom, I just -- the way you think about fee and commission income in the Private Bank is it's sort of a client business volume measure. So as Christian referred to it as sticky. So as we build balances we build activity. You've seen a year-on-year growth rate of 2%, but now at a level in the first quarter that significantly exceeds any quarter last year, especially the second, third and fourth. And so we think that, that's going to continue to build on itself and create sort of more and more year-on-year differential. There is some amount that obviously depends on clients' investment activity, trading activity, if you like, in any given quarter, but the, call it, the stable revenue base that we're seeing in Private Bank and fee and commission income growth is very encouraging, and I think it's set to continue. I think in terms of your question about resources in the FIC business, we're -- we've been very focused on that sort of consistently over the years. We tend to look at it in terms of revenue production related to RWA. As you can see, market risk RWA relatively modest for us, so it is principally credit risk RWA, both in the balance sheet and derivative businesses. But we think we've got some of the best in the business at understanding and optimizing that. And the same is true of leverage exposure where we manage to the constraints of our balance sheet but work to optimize how we deploy that leverage exposure to support clients as well as the revenue profile. Sometimes, by the way, the business you do is leverage exposure intensive, but not RWA-intensive and sometimes the opposite. And hence, the optimization efforts that we go to there are considerable and sophisticated. So I would stop there. I don't know if you want to add that thing."

        "text": "I'll also echo the previous remarks, thanks for the additional disclosure on IB revenues as well. Two questions from me. Firstly, on costs, you drew out the FDIC charge in Q4. You haven't drawn out anything in Q1, but I know a number of the U.S. banks did take a top up. So could you just say, is there anything costs for FDIC this quarter as well that you'd like to specify? And then the second question, just on the Corporate and Other division now that's been restated to include the legacy portfolios, I think you've got a loss this quarter, but includes quite a sizable benefit on timing differences or valuation and timing differences. So what should we think of it or what do you think would be usual quarterly run rate for that division going forward?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Thanks, Andrew. So \u20ac8 million is the number this quarter on FDIC by some -- a quirk of accounting, we can't characterize as bank levies, so we don't call it out separately. But it also means if I look at the net going into this quarter's run rate, actually, there were -- there's probably more things pushing it up than pushing it down, of which FDIC was one. There's always some degree of volatility. VNT was a feature this year, certainly, year-on-year in the quarter, it was relatively more neutral. But reflected really changes in the interest rate curve. By the way, some of which we would expect to get back in the balance of the year through pull to par. Always hard to say, therefore, what the pretax profit impact is going to be. We talk in the guidance about what the shareholder expense is that we expect, what the incremental -- what the sort of, call it, run rate or annual treasury funding costs are. So for modeling purposes, I would go with sort of a quarterly version of that annual guidance and accept that there is some volatility in valuation and timing. Incidentally, we've been working over the years to reduce and minimize that volatility to the extent we can. So lots of work has gone into hedge accounting programs and other things to both manage the risks -- the balance sheet risks that we have, but do so in a way that is as accounting neutral as we can, and we've made some good progress in that regard."

    "transcript": "Ioana Patriniche: Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2024 results call. As usual, our Chief Executive Officer, Christian Sewing, will speak first, followed by our Chief Financial Officer, James von Moltke. The presentation, as always, is available to download in the Investor Relations section of our website, db.com. Before we get started, let me just remind you that the presentation contains forward-looking statements which may not develop as it currently exists. We therefore ask you to take notice of the precautionary warning at the end of our materials. With that, let me hand over to Christian back to you on our end.\nChristian Sewing: A warm welcome from me. I'm delighted to be discussing our second quarter and first half results with you today. After another quarter where we made progress across the businesses. On our strategic initiatives, we are on track to hit our financial targets. We generated revenues of EUR15.4 billion in the first half on track to EUR30 billion of revenues this year. We have franchise momentum across all businesses, driving commissions and fee income. Our capital-light businesses are gaining market share such as our Corporate Bank and Origination & Advisory, which we expect to continue in the second half alongside a more supportive NI environment. We also delivered on our adjusted cost target our quarterly run rate is at EUR5 billion, in line with our commitments. Our results were impacted by the litigation provision of EUR1.3 billion related to the acquisition of Postbank, which we had to book this quarter. As said before, we strongly disagree with the changed and unexpected assessment of the court, and we are working hard to ultimately minimize the impact of this legal matter for our shareholders. But importantly, the bank's operational performance was not impacted. On the contrary, on an underlying basis, we delivered year-on-year improvements on our key target ratios. Excluding the Postbank takeover litigation provision, our post-tax return on tangible equity was 7.8%, up from 6.8% in the first half last year. The best first half and second quarter since 2011, which demonstrates the continued momentum in our operating businesses. Our cost-to-income ratio also improved from 73% to 69% year on year. And finally, our CET1 ratio of 13.5% remains solid despite absorbing Postbank and a number of legacy litigation matters, which shows our capital strength and gives us confidence to deliver on our capital distribution commitments. Let me now discuss in more detail some of the drivers of our first half results on slide 2. Pre-provision profit was up 17% year on year to EUR4.7 billion. Excluding the impact of the Postbank takeover litigation provision, we also demonstrated positive operating leverage, a core element of our strategy execution we grew revenues in our core businesses by 3% year on year, while Group revenues were up 2%. On a reported basis, our reported noninterest revenues were up 14% year on year with strong growth in commissions and fee income of 12%, which demonstrates clearly that our strategy to grow our capital-light business is working and we continue to deliver better than expected NI performance in our banking books, which provides additional comfort to our revenue path for 2024 and in years thereafter, we reduced our adjusted cost to EUR10.1 billion year on year. And we continue to deliver savings through our operational efficiency program, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. Now let's look at the franchise achievements across our businesses on Slide 3. In the first half year, the Corporate Bank delivered a 16% increase in incremental deals won with multinational clients compared to the prior year period. Our success with our with our clients were also rewarded with a series of high-profile awards, and we have continued to make investments to further strengthen our positioning with our clients. We are building out our structuring capabilities and our originate-to-distribute model, taking advantage of our broad investor base. All of that gives us confidence we can sustain our momentum. The Investment Bank made significant advances across the franchise over the first half of the year. Origination & Advisory increased its global market share to 2.6% in the first half year, a gain of more than 70 basis points over the full year 2023. And we raised our global ranking from the 11th to the seventh business continued to support clients through its multifaceted product offering, including M&A, sell side advice as well as debt issuance linked to the partnership between Grant Thorton and New Mountain Capital, fixed income and currency revenues were up 3% year on year, supported by a 7% increase in financing revenues even compared to a strong prior year period. Private Bank also continued to build momentum with EUR19 billion of net inflows in the first six months, supporting growth in assets under management of EUR34 billion. We are also seeing recognition for our transformation and digitalization efforts in our retail personal banking franchise with 13% more log-ins in Postbank mobile app since end of 2023. We are also improving services for our ultra-high net worth clients and for example, have established a dedicated team in Germany for ultra-high net worth clients. We are leveraging our enhanced technology and product capabilities to expand into FX products, strategic asset allocation or Lombard lending to ultra-high-net-worth clients in Europe. And we have further developed our key client relationships to boost asset gathering in the first half year, Asset Management grew assets under management by EUR37 billion to EUR933 billion. This was boosted by continued strong inflows into passive, in line with our strategy, which saw net inflows of EUR18 billion in the first six months and is expected to support future revenue generation. Now let me turn to our progress against our strategic objectives. On slide 4. We continued to make progress on all three pillars of our global house bank strategy. Starting with revenue growth, we delivered a compound annual growth rate of 5.7% since 2021. This underscores the benefit of a well-diversified and complementary business mix. Stable NII in our banking book segments was supported by strong non-interest revenues following our investments in our growth initiatives. Looking at the drivers behind commissions and fee income strength in the first six months, we saw growth mainly in our capital-light businesses. We saw particular strong momentum in Origination & Advisory as the market recovered and our franchise is strengthening and gaining market share a trend we expect to continue our initiatives in the Corporate Bank also paying off commissions and fee income grew by 6% with business growth across all regions, which is notably visible in trade finance and lending. We gained market share in our documentary trade business and our structuring capabilities are expanding, which includes increasing contribution from larger transition financing deals and in wealth management and private banking, we grew non-interest revenues from investment products and lending by 11%. We will continue to build on these developments and with business volumes growing, we are confident that our revenue trajectory will remain strong in the second half of the year. First, the impact from the expected NI normalization will be lower than initially anticipated with full year NII in our banking book segment broadly stable to the prior year level, and we will see continued commissions and fee income growth, mainly in Origination & Advisory, Corporate Bank and Asset Management. This puts revenues of EUR30 billion clearly in sight. Additionally, we are highly focused on targeted resource allocation and on driving balance sheet velocity, we continue to deliver on our EUR2.5 billion operational efficiency program, having completed measures, which delivered our expected gross savings of EUR1.5 billion, 60% of our target with around EUR1.2 billion in savings already realized. As part of this program, we have made workforce reductions of 2,700, including 700 FTEs during the second quarter, low, reaching nearly 80% of the planned total through end 2024. In addition, we have reduced contract external staff by approximately 1,100 in 2024. To date, we have clear sight of the remaining savings yet to come from our operational efficiency program, which will offset inflation in our investments in business growth. Our optimization initiatives in Germany are expected to generate savings of around EUR500 million, investments to reduce the complexity of our organization by improving technology and optimizing the workforce across infrastructure will deliver a further EUR550 million, an automation of processes alongside better alignment of our front-to-back setup, including the recent organizational changes will deliver another EUR250 million. This gives us further confidence that we are on track to deliver on our commitment of a quarterly run rate of adjusted cost of around EUR5 billion in 2024, and that we will further reduce this run rate closer to EUR4.9 billion by the end of the year to meet our noninterest expense objectives of around EUR20 billion. Finally, on capital efficiency, we achieved a beneficial equal to a EUR4 billion RWA reduction in the second quarter through data and process improvements. As a result, cumulative RWA reductions from capital efficiency measures reached already EUR19 billion. We have a line of sight on further reductions coming in the second half, and we are working towards meeting or exceeding our EUR25 million to EUR30 billion target. Let me conclude with a few words on our strategy on Slide 5. Our first half results represent another milestone in the progress with our global house bank strategy and set a path to achieving our 2025 target of greater than 10% return on tangible equity. First, we saw strong momentum across all businesses in a more mixed operating environment than we had expected with a better than expected NI trajectory, coupled with our complementary and growing global franchise. We are confident that our strong revenue momentum will deliver revenues of EUR30 billion this year. The investments we have made in our business give us confidence that this run rate will continue as around 75% of revenues come from more predictable base businesses. And we are the go-to European bank for our clients, and we'll continue to build on it by offering clients, full service product and solutions. This builds our confidence that we can achieve our 2025 target of EUR32 billion. Second we are delivering operational efficiencies, which maintain our EUR5 billion run rate in 2024 and will translate into further cost savings, achieving EUR20 billion of noninterest expenses in 2025. Simply put, our revenue growth, combined with our cost reductions will ensure positive operating leverage. Third, we have put material legacy items behind us. And although this results in higher litigation charges this year. Progress we are making should position us to deliver without major surprises in 2025. Fourth, we will see normalization and credit costs next year, closer to the underlying run rate we have this year after overlays and hedging, which will further bolster higher net income. We remain dedicated to creating value for our shareholders. Our earnings power and the progress we have made with capital optimization give us full confidence that we can maintain our trajectory to increase distributions beyond our original goal of EUR8 billion. In respect of the financial years 2021 to 2025, we completed the share repurchase program launched in March, bringing cumulative shareholder distributions through dividends and share repurchases to EUR3.3 billion since 2022. And we will continue to manage capital with the same discipline as over the past several years. To sum up with our business momentum and all the progress made, we have a clear line of sight on our target for IoT of greater than 10% for 2025. With that, let me hand over to James.\nJames von Moltke: Thank you, Christian. Let me start with a few key performance indicators on Slide 7 and place that in the context of our 2025 targets, Christian mentioned our continued business momentum, which resulted in revenue growth of 5.7% on a compound basis for the last 12 months relative to 2021. Within our revenue growth target range our reported half year cost income ratio was 78% and return on tangible equity was 3.9%, both impacted by the Postbank takeover litigation provision, excluding the for this provision, the ratios were 69% and 7.8%, showing further improvement compared to 2023. Our capital position remained solid in the second quarter with a CET1 ratio at 13.5% despite absorbing the aforementioned litigation provision. Our liquidity metrics also remained strong. The liquidity coverage ratio was 136% above our target of around 130%, and the net stable funding ratio was 122%. In short, our performance in the period reaffirms our resilience and our confidence in reaching our 2025 targets. With that, let me turn to the second quarter highlights on Slide 8. Group revenues were EUR7.6 billion, up 2% on the second quarter of 2023. Non-interest expenses were EUR6.7 billion, up 20% year on year, driven by the increased litigation charges in the quarter. Nonoperating costs, including litigation charges of EUR1.55 billion beyond the Postbank takeover litigation provision of EUR1.3 billion, there were additional charges of approximately EUR220 million related to a series of legacy items we resolved in the quarter. We also booked EUR106 million of restructuring and severance charges in line with our full year guidance. Adjusted costs increased 2% year on year due to higher compensation and benefits. Provision for credit losses was EUR476 million or 40 basis points of average loans, and I will discuss both adjusted costs and provisions in more detail shortly. We generated a profit before tax of EUR411 million and a net profit of EUR52 million. Our tax rate in the quarter of 87% was impacted by the aforementioned litigation charges, which were largely nondeductible. Excluding these litigation effects. The expected tax rate for the full year continues to be around 30%. In the second quarter, diluted earnings per share was negative $0.28 and tangible book value per share was EUR28.65, up 6% year on year. Let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results. Let me start with a review of our net interest income on Slide 9. And I was essentially flat across all of our key banking book segments at EUR3.4 billion, slightly above prior expectations and II. and each of the banking book segments follow the same trends as seen in the prior quarter. Our base case is that our quarterly NOI run rate will remain broadly stable, and we reiterate that we expect to improve on our earlier guidance for the full year banking book. Ni, the group number, reflecting accounting effects decreased by approximately EUR100 million compared to the previous quarter. This effect is offset by an increase in noninterest revenues and has no overall revenue impact to the group. With that, let's turn to adjusted cost development on Slide 10. Adjusted costs were EUR5 billion for the quarter, up 2% year on year. Year-on-year increase was driven by higher compensation and benefits costs, which were up by 6%, reflecting higher performance related compensation, wage growth as expected and increases in internal workforce after our targeted investments in talent throughout 2023, including numerous. Let's now turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 11. Provision for credit losses in the second quarter was one EUR476 million, equivalent to 40 basis points of average loans. The sequential increase in Stage one and two provisions to EUR35 million was mainly driven by the net effect of overlays and model enhancements, which were partly mitigated by quarter on quarter portfolio movements, Stage three provisions remained at an elevated level, but reduced slightly to EUR441 million. The decrease was mainly driven by the private bank, while provisions in the Investment Bank remained stable and were largely related to commercial real estate exposures. Provisions in the Corporate Bank increased driven by two larger impairment events looking ahead to the second half of the year, we are now seeing some stabilization in the broader U.S. CRE sector. So office US. office remains broadly unchanged. Overall, this should lead to lower provisions compared to the first half, but our office CRE portfolio will continue to be impacted. We also continue to conservatively manage our loan book with lower growth rates including active management of single-name concentration risks through well established comprehensive hedging programs reflecting on these items and considering developments in the first half of the year, we revised our full year guidance for provision for credit losses to be slightly above 30 basis points of average loans. Before we move to performance in our businesses, let me turn to capital on Slide 12. With 13.5%. Our second quarter Common Equity Tier one ratio was up slightly compared to the previous quarter. Cet one capital improved slightly, reflecting lower regulatory capital deduction items and strong net income for the quarter, largely offset by the Postbank takeover litigation provision. Risk-weighted assets increased from business growth, together with higher operational risk RWA, including the impact of the Postbank takeover mitigation provision, mostly offset by reductions from strong delivery of capital efficiency measures. At the end of the second quarter, our leverage ratio was 4.6%, 13 basis points higher compared to the previous quarter 12 basis, 12 basis points of the increase were driven by higher Tier one capital due to the EUR1.5 billion additional Tier one issuance in June. With that, let's now turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 14. Corporate Bank revenues in the second quarter were EUR1.9 billion, essentially flat year on year and up sequentially driven by growth in commissions and fee income and resilient deposit revenues as higher business volumes compensated higher client payouts. We have seen good progress on our growth initiatives to offset the normalization of deposit revenues by further accelerating non-interest revenue growth. Commissions and fee income increased by 5% sequentially and 9% year on year, driven by strong momentum in trade finance and lending across all products as well as in depositary receipts in our trust and agency services business, deposits increased by EUR3 billion in the quarter and are EUR32 billion higher year on year, driven by higher term and site deposits across currencies. The sequential increase in provision for credit losses was driven by Stage one and two provisions after moderate releases in the prior quarter and higher Stage three provisions, which included two larger events in the European and German corporate segment, which were largely covered by risk mitigating measures. Noninterest expenses were essentially flat year on year as higher internal service cost allocations and compensation costs were mostly offset by lower litigation costs. This resulted in a post-tax return on tangible equity of 15% and a cost-income ratio of 62%. I'll now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 15. Revenues for the second quarter were 10% higher year on year, driven by a strong performance in Origination & Advisory revenues and fixed income and currencies were essentially flat year on year reflecting the base effect of a strong prior year quarter. Financing credit trading and Emerging Markets' revenues were essentially flat year on year in credit trading, the non-repeat of strong distress performance in the prior year was offset by strength in the flow business. Thanks to our prior period investments, the macro businesses were both down year on year. The performance in rates primarily reflected the ongoing uncertainty around Central Bank interest rate policies. While FX revenues were impacted by reduced volatility, this was partially mitigated by strong performance in the spot business, benefiting from investments into technology. Moving to Origination & Advisory revenues doubled compared to the prior year, gaining market share both year on year and sequentially, while we maintained the number one rank in our home market debt origination continued to drive performance with an ongoing recovery in the leveraged debt market. While investment grade debt issuance activity remained elevated, advisory revenues were strong and materially higher both year on year and quarter on quarter, benefiting from the previously highlighted investments made into the franchise. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by our third quarter O&A pipeline, which is materially higher year on year. Although the market anticipated slowdown in M&A, M&A industry volumes in the summer and over the third quarter may limit the possibility to outperform the very strong second quarter. Noninterest expenses and adjusted costs were both slightly higher year on year, reflecting the impact of strategic investments, including the numerous acquisition. Provision for credit losses was EUR163 million or 63 basis points of average loans driven by Stage three impairments. Turning to the Private Bank on Slide 16. Pretax profit nearly doubled compared to the second quarter last year. Let me walk you through the drivers. Revenues in the quarter were EUR2.3 billion. This includes higher revenues from investment products and lending, which were more than offset by continued higher funding costs, including the impact of minimum reserves and the group neutral impact of certain hedging costs to the business. Excluding these effects, revenues would have been up by 1% year on year. The sequential revenue development reflects a typical seasonal pattern as some investment activities tend to be concentrated at the beginning of the year. As Christian mentioned before, the Private Bank saw strong business momentum with net inflows into assets under management of EUR7 billion in the quarter, Personal Banking revenues were impacted by the aforementioned higher funding and hedging costs for our lending books, partially offset by resilient deposit revenues in Germany, revenues in wealth management and private banking increased due to higher lending business and investment revenues offset by lower deposit revenues in Germany. Private Bank has continued its transformation with 38 branch closures in the first half of the year, and headcount reductions of more than 1,000 FTEs. In the last 12 months, noninterest expenses declined by 13%, including lower restructuring and severance costs and the non-recurrence of provisions for individual litigation cases. The improvement in adjusted cost of 3% reflects normalized investment spend and transformation benefits, partially offset by still elevated surface remediation costs. We expect these to taper off in the remainder of the year, contributed contributing to a run rate improvement in the second half of the year. The overall quality of our portfolio remained stable. Provision for credit losses benefited from a gain on sale of a nonperforming loan portfolio, but still includes the temporary effects of the operational backlog in personal banking, which are expected to reduce during the second half. Let me continue with Asset Management on Slide 17. My usual reminder, the asset management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Profit before tax improved by 55% from the prior year period, driven by higher revenues and lower noninterest expenses. Revenues increased by 7% versus the prior year. This was primarily from higher management fees of EUR613 million, resulting from higher fees generated by liquid products due to increasing average assets under management. Other revenues were significantly higher, benefiting from lower treasury funding charges and a one-off insurance recovery in the quarter. Performance and transaction fees were significantly lower, driven by performance fees and alternatives. Real estate noninterest expenses were 4% lower due to lower litigation expenses in the quarter, while adjusted costs were essentially flat compared to the prior year. Despite inflationary pressures, passive investments saw a net inflow of EUR9 billion in the quarter due to shifting consumer behavior from active into passive investment strategies. Digital channel distribution is supporting strong growth in Passave, resulting in positive momentum and six consecutive quarters of net inflows. Assets under management decreased by EUR8 billion to EUR933 billion in the quarter. The decrease was attributable to net outflows despite positive market appreciation and FX effects. Net outflows of EUR19 billion were primarily in low margin products in fixed income, cash and advisory services cost income ratio for the quarter declined to 68% and return on tangible equity was 18%, both improving from the prior year quarter. Moving to Corporate and Other on slide 18, Corporate & Other reported a pretax loss of EUR1.5 billion this quarter versus the equivalent pre-tax loss of EUR153 million in the second quarter of 2023, primarily driven by the Postbank takeover litigation provision of EUR1.3 billion. Revenues were positive EUR73 million this quarter. This compares to positive EUR85 million in the prior year quarter. Valuation and timing differences were positive EUR216 million in the quarter, driven by partial reversion of prior period losses and impacts from interest rate moves. This compares to positive EUR252 million in the prior year quarter. The pretax loss associated with legacy portfolios was EUR144 million, driven primarily by litigation charges and other expenses. At the end of the second quarter, risk-weighted assets stood at EUR32 billion, including EUR13 billion of operational risk RWA. In aggregate, RWAs have reduced by EUR9 billion since the prior year quarter. Leverage exposure was EUR36 billion at the end of the second quarter, slightly higher than the prior year quarter. Finally, let me turn to the group outlook on Slide 19, second quarter and first half performance demonstrate the successful execution of our strategy, and we remain confident that our businesses have strong momentum and are positioned for further growth and so our full year 2024 guidance for revenues and adjusted costs have not changed, respectively, at EUR30 billion and around EUR20 billion provision for credit losses for the year are now expected to come in slightly above 30 basis points of average loans. Finally, we have successfully mitigated several hundred headwinds to our capital position, which supports our distribution plan and this remains a key management priority. And as Christian said, our full focus remains on the execution of our strategy and the progress made in 2024 positions us well to achieve our 2025 targets. With that, let me hand back to you on up and we look forward to your questions.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you, James. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Chris Hallam from Goldman Sachs International.\nChris Hallam: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for the presentation and the remarks. So the first question is on revenues. I guess on a headline basis, the momentum is positive, but the mix is changing a little bit more on NI, perhaps a little bit less on fees outside of the Investment Bank. So if we look through for the EUR30 billion for this year and EUR32 billion, let's say, for next year, are you confident on those two numbers in particular, how would you see fees progressing both inside and outside of the IB? And then second, could you give us an update on where your discussions have got to with the ECB regarding any additional capital requirements relating to your leveraged finance business and how you see the outlook for your, let's say, franchise over the coming couple of years.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, Chris. That's a Christian. Thank you very much for your questions. Let me start and as usual, James may want to chip in on your first question on revenues and on kind of your key question, both numbers for 24 and 25. The answer is a clear. Yes, and let me start with 2024 and you have seen the H1 numbers, to be honest, I'm really happy with that with the 15.4 billion because all businesses have actually delivered. And the nice thing is if I now go over the next quarters and let me start with the predictable or more predictable divisions, i.e., the corporate bank, the private bank asset management, you can actually see that the momentum and the numbers which we have seen in the first two quarters are very, very good guidance for Q3 and Q4. I would even say that for the Private Bank and Asset Management, I even expect a slightly better development in H2 versus H1, given also that what James said in his prepared remarks on NII, but also in particular, because of the inflows and the assets under management behave in a very satisfactory way. On the corporate bank, I think a number of you know, which is around 1.9 billion given all the what I can see from the mandates we win is something which we can also plan for Q3 and Q4 that I would really say those three divisions are really having a good momentum. And yes, we benefit a bit more from a better NI than we expected at the start of the year. But even next to that, the underlying fee business behaving very well on the investment banking side, I absolutely believe that overall the I think the trajectory which we have seen over the last years in terms of market share wins in terms of stability of revenues and in terms of also predictability of revenues. If you think about the financing businesses, which we have also show me that the second half will be a very satisfactory one. Honestly, July started so far, pretty pretty good in the Investment Bank. And what makes me confident in the O&A business could be that the summer is a little bit slower in terms of M&A business than what we have seen in Q2. But overall, the market will further recover. We have gained 70 basis points in market share in the first half year. We believe that this will also be the case throughout the year. And to be honest, the investments which we have done in the origination and advisory business are really only starting to pay off. So the new people which we hired last year, they are gaining more and more momentum. So to be honest, I even expect that we get more market share in an overall market, which from a fee pool is increasing over the next 12 to 18 months. So that makes me confident that starting with the EUR15.4 billion revenue number, that 30 billion is absolutely inside, and I'm highly confident that we achieve that. Now 25. The first thing I would like to say it's for the first time. So to say, Chris, other than '24 and '23, they're both kind of income streams. And I and fee income are both going into an increasing direction. So it's different than in the former years where we always had one of these streams, which was kind of decreasing in 25, we have sort of, say, two positive growing engines, and that obviously helps us as a start. Now if I there go and actually through the business on the corporate bank, we think that 25 would be another increase over 20 for Y. because we can simply see the number of mandates transactions we are doing and the investments which we had in particular in our platform business in our payment businesses are paying off. And so therefore, we gave you also in the prepared remarks, the wins which we had in Q2, all that and the feedback we have from the client's point into another increase in 25. And again, the ENI is behaving even better than than we thought at the start of this year. Private Bank. I'm clearly up next year why we always told you that we have a tailwind in NII in 25 over 24. Secondly, we are obviously benefiting from the constant inflows into assets under management. And we don't believe that there is any change in the second half of the year. So the starting point is even a different one, similar actually in asset management. Also in those areas like alternatives and passive, where Stefan, who accesses a focus on, we are growing. And on the Investment Bank, actually, I do believe we will grow in all three areas. Number one, we have made further investments into our trading business, in particular, regionally in the US. We have new people starting now as we speak and we will grow that business the trading business over there. Secondly, I refer back to the remarks on the O. and A. business. We expect the fee market share to increase next year further increase over over this year. Secondly, market shares will grow with those investments, which we have done also talking about numerous. And thirdly, the financing business is not only stable but if I look at the income and revenue streams, which we have planned for next year, actually also an increase, all of that from a very encouraging behavior in 2024 makes me absolutely confident that we can achieve the EUR32 billion next year. So the second question on the ECB, to be honest, a, you know, I have seen that portfolio, the leverage lending portfolio now for the last 15 years. And to be honest, it always behaved very well because I think our risk appetite and the way we have managed. Our risk has demonstrated that we are in very good control of that business. You also know Chris, and this is not a secret that a few years ago, we had started the discussions with the ECB. We got a capital add on at that point time of 20 basis points, which was reduced last year by five basis, five basis points. I know that there is a discussion between the industry and the ECB. I take it as a very positive signal that the ECB is now reviewing the comments and our arguments from the industry. And therefore, you know, also obviously, with all outside opinions, which we get for our portfolio, I feel very confident with the level of provisions we have with the way we manage it. It's a it's a key business for us. It's a core business of ours that will not change. And I'm sure we will also come to a solution there which shows that we have managed it in a fair way. I don't know, James, whether you want to add. James von Moltke, Deutsche Bank AG - President, Chief Financial Officer and Responsible for the Asset Management, Member of the Management Board All good.\nChris Hallam: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Nicolas Payen from Kepler Cheuvreux.\nNicolas Payen: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two, one on distribution and one on litigations on distribution. I was wondering if we could have an update on what is your total distribution targets? Because you committed to distribute above EUR8 billion of capital, but could we have a bit more clarity by how much you expect to exceed this 8 billion mark? And also timing wise, what should we expect notably for the share buyback is a top-up completely excluded for H2 and what about the pace in 2025? And regarding litigation, what should we expect regarding the litigation provision H2 through more globally? You have now reduced quite significantly turnkey or contingent liabilities. So I was wondering should we expect a lower litigation cost run rate for the future rates for the future years? Thank you.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you very much. And let let me start, Nicolas and then James will I think comment on both question on the distribution because that is really important for me. There is no change in guidance. We will distribute more than 8 billion in the timeframe from 21 to 25. Nothing has changed, obviously, from a timing point of view, as we said end of April with the with the item on the Postbank provision of EUR1.3 billion, which we had to digest. We always said that we now need to have two quarters actually where we show operating strengths where we restore capital. And to be honest, I'm really happy of what has been done in this bank. We are at 13.5% capital. We have created excess capital. Also in the last quarter, we are clearly above, so to say the 13.2%, we have created excess capital, but I want to show to the market another quarter of this operating strength. And with the with the comments I just made on revenues with costs, which are absolutely in control, we are around the EUR5 billion we have our clear way to the next year. I'm absolutely confident that we show another very strong quarter in Q three, which generates capital. And then obviously we are back in the progress process and we will go back and enter into discussions. That is clear for me. But I always signaled that after the Postbank litigation, which the bank digested, we really powered through this we want to show too good quarters. Number one is done, and I'll tell you, number two will come.\nJames von Moltke: Thanks, Christian. Nicola, thanks for the question. Look, I'd just echo Christian's comments. We've returned almost EUR1.6 billion already this year through the capital actions that we took in the second quarter. We were, I think, very successful offsetting the impact of the Postbank provision and our step off into the second half of 13.5% on the CET1 ratio is a good starting place. Your question about the trajectory going forward. If I refer you to slide 22 of our investor deck, we've tried to be as clear as possible on what we've referred to as baseline expectations. And so if you look at that on the dividend, we've paid out this year 883 and the $0.675 next year would be about 1.3 billion. The EUR1 dividend that we intend to pay out in 26 in respect of 25 would be another nearly 2 billion. And then if you trace the the buyback sort of trajectory forward. And let's just assume for a second, 50% increase a year, the next two numbers in that series would be about EUR1 billion and 1 billion and a half cumulatively that would add to slightly above 9 billion. And so that's what we're working to deliver to shareholders. As we, as Christian mentioned, build excess capital in the back half of the year, we want to be positioned to achieve those those types of payout. Now we did make a sort of an editorial change to the to page 22 really trying to kind of separate a little bit the share buybacks from the the payout ratio discussion because to some extent we look at the payout ratio as a minimum, not a maximum and hence building excess capital into the back half of the year can position us to preserve that buyback trajectory even if the payout ratio goes goes north of 50%. And so that's the hopefully clarity and on what the baseline expectations are. And just the last thing to say last time, you saw that slide there was this idea of top-ups. And obviously, the unexpected provision in 24, at least for now is taken away the idea of a top-up in 24. But we haven't given up on top-ups in 25 and 26. It depends on sort of all of the ins and outs in the capital plan. But I'd just echo Christian's confidence that we I think we've been able to show that the Postbank provision did not take us off stride, and we remain committed to the to the so the profile we show on page 22 if I go to your litigation question, look, obviously there's been a and a transition between the contingent liability number and the and the balance sheet provision driven by the Postbank litigation takeover litigation provision, but actually not only that provision of some other items also move between the two sort of the off balance sheet and the on-balance sheet accounts. As we said, last quarter. The profile has changed pretty significantly, if you like, of risks that are still unknown and we are committed to continuing the work over the back half of the year to put ourselves in a position for, I would call it dramatically lower litigation provisions and regulatory enforcement actions going forward. Really we'd like to be in a position at the end of the year to have what I call is as clean a slate as possible going into 25 and sustainably. So because if you like, we'll address the the unknown elements of the known items. And as we look to the future sort of the pipeline of new things coming in that we can see and by the way, the benefits of all the investments we've made in controls should should give us much more confidence about the outlook going forward.\nNicolas Payen: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Anke Reingen from RBC.\nAnke Reingen: Thank you very much for taking my questions. The first is on the loan loss guidance for 2024. If you can maybe give us a bit more what what gives you confidence of the decline? So more like 25, 30 basis points in the second half and what you've assumed on commercial real estate AmerGen, that number and as you sort of like set in 2025, you expect on loan losses to normalize. Would that be a 25, 30 basis points or that 20 basis points you mentioned in the past. And then just on CapEx, I just wondered if you can give us some more clarity on the expectation with the benefit from the delay of the FITB., what it could mean for for the 15 billion you previously guided? And would you consider this and your distribution as an extra benefit? And then sorry, just one last question on the dividend and the distributions, if I may. If you have a payout rate, if the 68 dividend per share, which corresponds to more than 50%, am I right in from your previous comments to understand that come the focus is the absolute distribution rather than the payout ratio. Thank you very much.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, Anke, and I'm happy to take all three, Chris, you may want to add, but look at the CLP. guidance change, I would think of it as more related to what has already happened in the year in the first half than then about our outlook for the second half. And we've had a number of events really to corporates default and then an overlay that we booked in Q2 that have taken us slightly north of what we'd anticipated when we spoke to you three months ago. And while you're always a little bit looking in a crystal ball. We've been we've been in a granular way looking through the portfolio, including commercial real estate to have a view on the second half. You'll recall that I've talked in the past of a 24 run rate closer to say, EUR350 million per quarter that we that we felt was sort of present and that in a sense is, let's say, EUR100 million of CRE. sitting on top of EUR250 million of ordinary course run rates that is in the portfolio. Now let's start with the last point, we still see the same stability in our own underlying portfolios in both the retail and the corporate portfolios. So we haven't seen a deterioration on top of that. We've seen, as I mentioned, a handful of defaults and also an overlay that we booked in CRE. I recall that we've seen a stabilization in 24 and relative to the deterioration that was taking place last year that actually persisted in the second quarter. What is perhaps a little bit worse? Is that the the sort of beginnings of a recovery that I might have expected three months ago. That hasn't happened yet. It doesn't change our view, frankly, of the direction of travel and that essentially over time, the new defaults and the valuation adjustments that remain in that portfolio begin to sort of burn out some CRE. If you if you go back to the fourth quarter results, we'd said to expect about $450 million in 24, consistent with our 23 performance that is probably worsened ever so slightly, call it 50, maybe EUR75 million in terms of our expectation, but not dramatically. As I say, the larger part of the change in guidance is what's already happened in the year around a couple of corporate items in the corporate defaults in the and the overlay and on FRTB, obviously good news for the industry in Europe because I think it would have put us at a competitive disadvantage if the U.S. were not to go forward and Europe to go forward. So we think it's a sensible change. It essentially cuts in half just simple math. We had given you say, EUR15 billion of RWA increase from CRR. three as of January 1st next year. I'd now build about 7.5 into the models and move the other $7.5 billion into the 1st of January 2026. So that's obviously helpful in our capital path. Helpful to us in terms of building up this excess capital, I just talked about I'm looking into the 25 distributions and then that feeds nicely into your third question, which is which is which is binding, we think of the 50% payout intention as you know, if you like a floor, it's what we would then accrue to during the year based on the interim profit recognition and because of the impact on profitability in 24 coming from the Postbank provision, that payout ratio, I think we'll easily cover our dividend and maybe some amount of repurchase. But what we want to do is put ourselves in a position of being an excess capital to to fund and then the rest of the repurchase in 25. And hence, to your point, we wouldn't view the 50% payout as being binding again.\nAnke Reingen: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan.\nKian Abouhossein: Yes, thanks for taking my two questions. Tom, I wanted to come back briefly on cost in your remarks, Christian, you talked about the EUR4.9 billion run rate potentially at the end of the year. And I just wanted to see how you think about the flexibility that that offers next year to get your cost income guidance from? If you can talk maybe around is there flexibility to run below EUR20 billion in that sense, I'm considering you're indicating a lower number for the end of the year, even if it's adjusted versus stated and how that thinking is around and confident around the cost income guidance. And the second question is related to provisions again, I wanted to just dig a little bit deeper after anchors question. The detailed answer in respect to CRE. Clearly, the assumptions are that CRE will stabilize? It sounded like that come in 2025. And I wanted to just get a better understanding what assumptions you're making. If you can talk a little bit about the input assumptions, price, the price performance and CREU. S and default rates, are you assuming on a macro level in CRE? And so we get a better understanding. And lastly, if I just may on leverage loans, you kind of answered the question, but I also wanted to see if there's any leverage loan additional provision requirement. Does that mean there could be a buyback push back?\nJames von Moltke: Perfect. Okay. And let me start with the cost answer. First of all, I think most important is that we stick to our target and that we show you that we deliver on that likely like I think we have demonstrated from Q4 23 when we started with the EUR5.3 billion of quarterly cost that we come down to 5.0, which we have done now looking ahead and what is in the pipeline of additional cost measures to be executed over the next quarters in terms of achieving the EUR2.5 billion of overall cost cuts. And I'm very confident that we will come to the EUR4.9 billion of quarterly costs at the end of Q4, Q4 starting of Q1. So this is for us where we are focusing on in this regard. We have obviously put all the cost measures into so-called key deliverables, which we are tracking on a biweekly basis in the Management Board. And we can actually see that with all the investments we have done with all the also headcount cuts, which we have executed in Q1 and Q2. We are delivering on that in Q3 and Q4. And therefore, I'm confident that the run rate of EUR4.9 billion, which we need for 2025 will be achieved, to be honest in this regard key. And just to give you a little bit of a seal the hardest core quarter to achieve the EUR5 billion was actually Q2, right from the start of the year where and why? Because all the salary increases actually came into Q2 we had a lot of the staff reductions to be done in Q2 where these people were still so to say on our payroll and both we have managed, i.e., you saw the number of reduced workforce, not only internally, but also externally what we managed to do in Q2. And secondly, we digested the wage and salary increases, i.e., the annual tariff increases which we which we digested. And now we are working down these key deliverables, as I just said. And that gives me all the confidence that we are coming to the run rate of EUR4.9 billion. Now what further flexibility do we have in that? The EUR4.9 billion is obviously then also correlated to sort of say our revenue aspirations and the revenue target I laid out, you know, from our previous discussions that there is always certain flexibility also on the cost number in terms of flexibility when it comes to less volumes when it comes to variable comp when it comes to technology investments. And obviously, this is all in our hand and therefore, I don't want to rule out at all that there is further flexibility. But for me, given there where the momentum of the bank is on the revenue side, I have all all eyes focused on the EUR4.9 billion. And here I can give you my full confidence that we will achieve that because or the underlying structural cost reductions are actually in time, in plan, in execution.\nChristian Sewing: And turning to your question on provisions and the impact of CRE, I maybe I can draw your attention to Slide 34 and the and the investment in the IR deck. Now this is where I had guided that the next in the series would be down in Q2. And so as always, predictions about the future are a slightly uncertain science but we've sort of traveled more or less at the level we had in Q4 and Q1. So the recovery that I mentioned earlier didn't come as quickly as as I had expected and look, by the way, the one 30 in Q2 actually had some some impact of the overlay. So so if you take that out, we were at one 23 essentially flat for the last two quarters. Now what gives us confidence about the direction of travel here? Really two things. One is that the if we look at the portfolio in a granular way. So loan-by-loan, which loans in which loans do we see there a possibility of future defaults? That number is declining. And so so the if you like, the risk content that remains in the portfolio, it is declining. And but what drove the kind of missed my expectations this quarter was more that the existing the defaulted portfolio, our estimate is my estimation of lifetime losses increased in the quarter. So that also will find a level and stabilize it at some point. So I had hoped that and expected that we'd probably be closer to 100 in there in the second quarter. Let's see how this develops in the quarters to come. But given the way portfolios like this perform, you can the downslope can be can be quite dramatic. And then on leverage lending, look, we we believe our provisions or the allowance for loan losses is prudent and adequate for the risks we see in the portfolio. And we are always open to and taking on feedback from our internal AQR views, our auditors and also the regulators when they come into to review the portfolios and see. And at the end of the day, it is for us to determine on the basis of the accounting rules, what the appropriate provision is. We'll continue to monitor and adapt dynamic way, but we think our practices are good and we will continue to engage in a constructive way and with the supervisors on that on that dialogue.\nKian Abouhossein: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Tom Hallett from KBW.\nTom Hallett: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you tell us how you see the deposit mix and main trends developing in the second half of the year across the Corporate Bank and the Private Bank and how much some of the recent political uncertainty may be impacting this? And then secondly, on SRP.s, which is obviously becoming quite a popular tool for banks these days. Could you just give us some color on the potential CET1 benefit over the next year and then maybe quantify or help us understand the size of the overall opportunity here, which as an outsider, I guess I'm thinking about it in terms of size of the scope of assets that are generally earning below the regulatory cost of capital. Thank you.\nChristian Sewing: Thanks, Tom. And two interesting questions. Look, loan growth has been more sluggish incoming than we'd expected as you've heard on our calls for the past year or so. That said, we did have loan growth in the second quarter. And so the kind of first encouraging sign we have $2 billionof loan growth this quarter. And we think that the kind of indicators of increasing activity are there. And there's certainly demand in some of the more more structured lending areas some. So we think that that recovery is starting. And in the retail portfolios in particular, there's still sort of a relatively slow environment in German mortgages and our portfolio have traded slightly. But again, there I think we've found a floor and can grow from here. And on the deposit side, really encouraging sort of performance, especially in corporate bank, but we also see in the private bank have a clear ability to raise deposits at a pricing that is that is attractive. And so you may see a leveling out a little bit of the deposit growth in the back half of the year. But but we think the volumes there generally are encouraging in terms of healthy growth, frankly, on both sides of the balance sheet going forward. If I look at SRT. look for us, some of our risk transfer programs are 20 years old. So we've been at this for a while and we have good structured programs, and we have a great level of engagement with the investors in our structures that have been with us for a long time. And we're sort of constantly on the lookout for portfolios where we think they can be more efficiently held off of the bank's balance sheet than on our balance sheet. \\ Therefore, I would say the scope isn't dramatic, but they're still there's still things we look at. And you've seen that as part of the, you know, program we've had for capital efficiency of where we were after 25 to 30, as you've seen in the past year or so, securitization has been part of that growing our SRT. programs or the funded credit-linked note programs we have is also being part of that. So I think a marginal contribution from here and we're always looking, but we have a reasonably sizable benefit as things stand from those types of tougher types of structures. One last comment to make at the risk of going long as we get into the CRR. three world and the impact of the output floor. Obviously, there's a there's a whole new sort of Vista, if you like, of assets that we may look to take off our balance sheet because we'll be solving for another variable. So in the past, it's been managing concentration risk and to a lesser extent, RWA going forward, it will be those two things plus plus the impact on the output floor of different asset classes.\nTom Hallett: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Giulia Aurora Miotto from Morgan Stanley.\nGiulia Aurora Miotto: Yes, hi, good morning. My first question is on the private bank. And could you please give us a bit more detail a bit more color on how quickly the fee line can grow and what initiatives you have underway to really control this and drive this in the next quarters and in 25 in particular. And so that would be my first question. And then secondly, and you talked about a loan growth dynamics? What about asset and margins? How are those evolving in your main products, please? Thank you.\nChristian Sewing: Yes, let me take a let me take the first question, Julia, on the private bank. And actually, it's a first of all, a continuous improvement on the fee business, a grocer in the private bank. I'm kind of in particular, when I look to the future a quarter over quarter and why? Because we have a constant inflow in our assets under management, by the way, domestically as well as internationally. And by the way, also and this is very nice, not only sort of say in the private bank and wealth management business, but also in the personal banking business in Germany. Secondly, I think for the private bank. And if we if we think about the overall profitability, there is a huge focus. Now on turning around the personal banking business in the private bank in Germany, that obviously, given all the integration work, which we which we are doing and which we have done in particular last year with the IT transformation had an unacceptable return on equity. So far. But if I look actually at the strategy from Claudio, how we will digitalize this business, how we actually will make this business in particular for the investment and fee-related business a business, which is there for 19 million clients and in particular, for the 50 million Post Bank clients, I expect actually a good growth coming from this personal banking and at the same time, we are now realizing the fruits of integrating the IT, i.e., the costs are coming down. And here we are talking, like we said in the previous calls about a 500 million cost reduction just as a direct cost in the private bank as a result of the integration. So it's a constant, a growth across the subdivisions in the private bank. But the real lever is actually bringing the personal bank in Germany with a clear plan to an acceptable return on equity over the next 12 to 18 months, which is then obviously also a huge lever for the overall Group profitability.\nJames von Moltke: So maybe I could add, and this is also a little bit in answer to Chris's question earlier, which was about sort of fee and commission engines outside the Investment Bank, obviously, just in the Investment Bank, a big part of the story this year and next year is is advisory and underwriting fees where we think the momentum, the wallet growth is there and there's an opportunity that we're executing on to increase our market share. But if you go away from the Investment Bank. As Christian just said, you know, the the private bank earns commissions and fee revenues in brokerage and investment management fees and commissions and asset management does the same on the investment management side and you have visibility into those revenue sources from the AUM increases or development over time. And then you can also you can also be helped or hindered by the market levels, but the visibility is there. And then in the corporate bank and you've got fees on loan inception, loan processing processing, you have payment activity, custody activity again, sort of an asset driven trust and agency services. And again, the visibility into those revenue sources is high, including based on the the RFP process and the implementation of new business that we win. And so so as I say, the visibility into these revenue sources is strong. And based on our current outlook, we can see some of these lines continuing the types of growth rates this year so far, which has been 12% each quarter and for the half extending into next year. On the and on the spread side, there, too we've been surprised to the upside this year, frankly, on both sides of the balance sheet. So as we've talked about, deposit margins have been better than anticipated as the pass through and continues to outperform. On the loan side. The same has been true. The spreads in the front book have been better than our than we anticipated to be fair a bit mixed on the private bank and corporate bank and investment bank. There's been reasonably healthy spreads and new lending in the front book. And those that's that sort of margin expansion has contributed to the to the better than expected net interest income than we had anticipated. And by the way, the other driver of the NI outperformance is also spreads on our unsecured debt. And so so all of those engines are helping sustain this year that net interest income line and contribute to the expected growth next year.\nGiulia Aurora Miotto: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Mate Nemes from UBS.\nMate Nemes: Yes, good afternoon and thanks for the presentation. I have three questions, please. First of all, on RWA reduction, I think you have achieved now EUR19 billion in total RAB reduction as a result of the optimization program. And could you give us a sense of the timing of the remaining reductions to get to your EUR25 billion targets. Is that largely coming through in the second half of this year or some of that should be in 25? And then the second question is on share buybacks. Just referring to your slide 22 and the 50% per annum growth in share buybacks, I think the original expectation certainly by the market was and a higher total amount of buyback in 2024 on which the increase into next year would have been obviously quite substantial. My question is, are we looking at a 50% increase versus the 675 million for the buyback next year? Or should we think of a potentially larger increase due to the scrapped second tranche of the buyback in 24. And finally, the last question is on the Corporate Bank loss provisions. And could you give us any sense of these single cases or single corporate events are they reflective of any deterioration in the overall asset quality in the broader corporate sector. Thank you.\nJames von Moltke: So thank you, guys, for the questions. Look at first of all, we're very pleased with the progress there and credit to the teams that have been working so hard to drive this optimization. And, you know, broadly speaking, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, I would hope that we could achieve another 2 billion in Q3. And there I think we've got good line of sight to that, maybe a little bit more. And if we achieve the same in Q4, I would be pleased. So if we got to say 4 billion incremental this year, bringing us to 23 billion, maybe 24, that would be that would be good performance, which, to your point, leaves five or six next year to get to 30 and potentially there's upside beyond that. And that obviously is helpful in driving the excess capital creation that I talked about earlier. So So assume for modeling purposes, 4 billion this year and at least six next year.\nMate Nemes: And on the buyback?\nJames von Moltke: Yes, it was what was taken out. And in 24, I think that the consensus number was that the second buyback authorization could be something in the order of four to 500 million. This year, and that was actually a fair assumption. And absent the litigation provision, I think we would have been in a good position to seek that. But I want to be clear the baseline was intended always to be off the in this case, the six 75 with potential top-ups, depending on the level of excess capital in each year. And so I want to reiterate the baseline expectation that something that management's working towards to deliver and and let's see what whether there's room for the top-ups. We certainly haven't given up on the idea that there wouldn't could be top-ups. And those top-ups would take us from the call it 9.2 that's implied by the by the the progression and to something beyond that again, it underscores why it is that we say we've got confidence and exceeding the 8.8 billion.\nChristian Sewing: And on the asset quality in the corporate book, I think James already said that, no, there is no deterioration. To be honest. The two cases James were referring to. It's actually sort of say, dominated by one case in Europe, but also here? Yes, we have to have we had to build a loan-loss provision. But I think overall, we should also not forget that the risk management overall has actually worked quite well because we have a substantial coverage actually from a CLO point of view, which again, brings me back to the point that, yes, you see a slightly elevated loan-loss provision number, but the real run rate if we take overlays out. And if I also take this into account, the real run rate of loan loss provision is, in my view, actually the normal stock of run rate of the EUR250 million plus a quarterly number, which always can happen. And you can now say it's 75, it's EUR100 million but that brings me also to the confidence because we don't see from a rating point of view from a watch list point of view from upgrades versus downgrades. We don't see any material deterioration, also not in the German mid-cap book. Brings me to the confidence that actually a number of EUR1.3 billion is a number where I'm absolutely confident that there should be a run rate for Deutsche Bank in terms of loan-loss provisions per year.\nJames von Moltke: That's great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Stefan Stalmann from Autonomous.\nStefan Stalmann: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have just two left, please. Starting with the private bank, you mentioned an NPL sale. Can you tell us roughly how big this was notionally the terms and whether there was actually a P&L profit or loss on the back of this sale? And the second question relates to the valuation and timing differences in your corporate center, which have been mostly positive in recent quarters? And can we think of this as here balance, which is still negative? I think you are still working yourself out of the spectrum neutral or is it actually now a positive and overall balancing there's a risk that eventually that normalizes down to neutral with negative effects in coming quarters? Thank you very much.\nJames von Moltke: Thanks for the question, Stefan. So briefly, I don't know the notional of the NPL sale, but but in round numbers, think of us as having a CLP benefit of about EUR25 million in the quarter on the sale, which was offset by incremental CLPR., continued drag from the operational disruptions of about the same amount. So the call it 150 that you see in the second quarter is a pretty good indication of the run rate and going into the second half of the year in the private bank, given we wouldn't necessarily expect will the drag from operational items. We do expect to go away and potentially reverse in the second half of the year and the P&L sale, the NPL sale wouldn't necessarily repeat either on the valuation timing differences, I'd really call out two elements. The first is pull to par in the investment portfolio. And that has has a short term and a sort of a more medium term element in the short term, some of the pull to par in Q2 was actually Q1 losses given given the market movements, and we expect some more of that to bleed into earnings in the second half of the year. So there's a short-term element. It's actually also. And given the way the hedges work, there's also a longer-term element which we expect to come out over a much longer period of time. So yes, in a sense. There's a there's a a positive balance, call it that way that is that is to come there. There's also the impact of our, you know, our swap funding book and which is which is helpful. It today represents it's driven by the differential between euro and dollar rates. That's remained by and large supportive. And how that trends from here will depend on the on the on the gap between the two rates. So So different parts, I don't see it disappearing in a heartbeat, but some but over time would moderate. Let's say in a two, three year time horizon.\nStefan Stalmann: Many thanks.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Matthew Clark from Mediobanca.\nMatthew Clark: Hi. It's just a follow up question on the leverage loan and potential ECB supervisory expectations deductions compared to your risk-weighted asset on a Pillar two add-on. So do you see that the supervisory expectations on provisioning as being incremental to the existing Pillar two add-on that you have or do you see it as potentially netting a gain for that effective, but you've already got some new requirements? Thank you.\nChristian Sewing: But Matthew, it's always hard to speculate about the items which which are at the end of the day in the hands of the regulators, again, are I really would like to say that we find it positive that the ECB is taking our arguments. It is reviewing its process. And I told you that we already were subject to a capital add-on. We feel with all the information we have that we have provisioned in an absolute accurate way, and I think we have shown that over the long term. And therefore, overall, we feel comfortable, but I think it would be it would be the wrong thing. Now to speculate about anything, I think the direction of the ECB, I find that constructive, we have constructive discussions and then let's see what happens. But the direction last year that reduced from 20 basis points to 15 also shows that there was at least some confidence in our processes. Perfect.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Jeremy Sigee from BNP Paribas Exane.\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you. Just a couple of small follow-ups, please. Firstly, on the changes in regulatory adjustments, that helped capital in the quarter. Can you talk a bit more about what those were and whether there's more of them to come or any reversals or they just are what they are so and that would be helpful. And then my second question is just on the Russia case you mentioned in the notes. And could you confirm that there's no financial impact in this quarter. And in fact, there's no provision booked because it's fully offset by the claim. And just how confident you are in that? Because other banks involved seem to be taking charges relating to that case.\nJames von Moltke: Thanks, Jeremy. And so I'll refer you on the first question to page 42 of the of the interim report and the main driver that we're referring to is what we call the expected loss shortfall. And that's but but in that disclosure, you see the various regulatory capital deduction items. The LSF. has been something that's increased significantly year on year, reflecting the portfolio changes that we introduced last year and some of the I'll call it seasoning of those parts of those models and yes, it's one of the areas that we're now looking at and how we can mitigate and manage. And so that helped us on the regulatory capital deduction items in the quarter. Is just learning which exposures drive the LSF. and how we can we can mitigate that. And to your question about direction of travel, actually, the next step will be up as one more model kind of becomes live in that world. But then we, I think would be at a sort of a steady state level and we will work to to optimize from that. On Russia, we essentially booked offsetting provision and an indemnification asset. And so we feel we're appropriately the risk is appropriately reflected on the balance sheet and the fee evolution of the cases has been overall in line with our expectations. So we don't see sort of a change in the risk position there and therefore no change in how it's reflected in the financial statements. Our expectation is that that claim will be prosecuted and in a way that enables us to enforce the the indemnification claim.\nJeremy Sigee: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the next question comes from Andrew Coombs from Citi.\nAndrew Coombs: It's morning and I think the vast majority of questions have been answered now. But perhaps I can just ask I'm on slide 29 on your interest income sensitivity and to take in light of the PMI data today, I think this is the first time we switch this from 24 to 26, 25 to 27 sensitivity and but a big step uptick in euro sensitivity coming through in 2027. I assume it isn't Tom related to the structural hedge that and you can do in terms of providing more color on why such a big step-up coming through from 26 to 27 are in your interest rate sensitivity guidance?\nJames von Moltke: Thanks, Andrew. Appreciate the question. Really just time. We actually the first time when we prepared this slide, I was surprised because it looked like the sensitivity and expanded. And I I missed that we'd moved it forward by a year. And so that gives you an indication of how successful we've been, frankly in closing down the rate sensitivity on our balance sheet. So 27 being larger is simply a function that are that are our hedge portfolio, you know, are less of it goes out that far in time. And what you'd expect to see us do as we roll over the hedges is bring more of that in and reduce the sensitivity further down the down the track and equivalently the 90 million in 27 on EUR, I would I would expect to see go down unless there's some change in our in our view of the, you know, of the likely future path of interest rates. And so in short, I'm I'm happy with the way that we've managed the sort of ALM challenges of the last several years. And I think, again, it's one of the things that gives us confidence and visibility into revenues in the future is the success of our hedging and the impact of the of the hedge rollover and over the next several years.\nAndrew Coombs: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I would now like to turn the conference back over to you on our, but we need to for any closing remarks.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you. Thank you for joining us and your questions. For any follow-ups. Please come through to the Investor Relations team, and we look forward to speaking to you on our third-quarter call.",

        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "A warm welcome from me. I'm delighted to be discussing our second quarter and first half results with you today. After another quarter where we made progress across the businesses. On our strategic initiatives, we are on track to hit our financial targets. We generated revenues of EUR15.4 billion in the first half on track to EUR30 billion of revenues this year. We have franchise momentum across all businesses, driving commissions and fee income. Our capital-light businesses are gaining market share such as our Corporate Bank and Origination & Advisory, which we expect to continue in the second half alongside a more supportive NI environment. We also delivered on our adjusted cost target our quarterly run rate is at EUR5 billion, in line with our commitments. Our results were impacted by the litigation provision of EUR1.3 billion related to the acquisition of Postbank, which we had to book this quarter. As said before, we strongly disagree with the changed and unexpected assessment of the court, and we are working hard to ultimately minimize the impact of this legal matter for our shareholders. But importantly, the bank's operational performance was not impacted. On the contrary, on an underlying basis, we delivered year-on-year improvements on our key target ratios. Excluding the Postbank takeover litigation provision, our post-tax return on tangible equity was 7.8%, up from 6.8% in the first half last year. The best first half and second quarter since 2011, which demonstrates the continued momentum in our operating businesses. Our cost-to-income ratio also improved from 73% to 69% year on year. And finally, our CET1 ratio of 13.5% remains solid despite absorbing Postbank and a number of legacy litigation matters, which shows our capital strength and gives us confidence to deliver on our capital distribution commitments. Let me now discuss in more detail some of the drivers of our first half results on slide 2. Pre-provision profit was up 17% year on year to EUR4.7 billion. Excluding the impact of the Postbank takeover litigation provision, we also demonstrated positive operating leverage, a core element of our strategy execution we grew revenues in our core businesses by 3% year on year, while Group revenues were up 2%. On a reported basis, our reported noninterest revenues were up 14% year on year with strong growth in commissions and fee income of 12%, which demonstrates clearly that our strategy to grow our capital-light business is working and we continue to deliver better than expected NI performance in our banking books, which provides additional comfort to our revenue path for 2024 and in years thereafter, we reduced our adjusted cost to EUR10.1 billion year on year. And we continue to deliver savings through our operational efficiency program, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. Now let's look at the franchise achievements across our businesses on Slide 3. In the first half year, the Corporate Bank delivered a 16% increase in incremental deals won with multinational clients compared to the prior year period. Our success with our with our clients were also rewarded with a series of high-profile awards, and we have continued to make investments to further strengthen our positioning with our clients. We are building out our structuring capabilities and our originate-to-distribute model, taking advantage of our broad investor base. All of that gives us confidence we can sustain our momentum. The Investment Bank made significant advances across the franchise over the first half of the year. Origination & Advisory increased its global market share to 2.6% in the first half year, a gain of more than 70 basis points over the full year 2023. And we raised our global ranking from the 11th to the seventh business continued to support clients through its multifaceted product offering, including M&A, sell side advice as well as debt issuance linked to the partnership between Grant Thorton and New Mountain Capital, fixed income and currency revenues were up 3% year on year, supported by a 7% increase in financing revenues even compared to a strong prior year period. Private Bank also continued to build momentum with EUR19 billion of net inflows in the first six months, supporting growth in assets under management of EUR34 billion. We are also seeing recognition for our transformation and digitalization efforts in our retail personal banking franchise with 13% more log-ins in Postbank mobile app since end of 2023. We are also improving services for our ultra-high net worth clients and for example, have established a dedicated team in Germany for ultra-high net worth clients. We are leveraging our enhanced technology and product capabilities to expand into FX products, strategic asset allocation or Lombard lending to ultra-high-net-worth clients in Europe. And we have further developed our key client relationships to boost asset gathering in the first half year, Asset Management grew assets under management by EUR37 billion to EUR933 billion. This was boosted by continued strong inflows into passive, in line with our strategy, which saw net inflows of EUR18 billion in the first six months and is expected to support future revenue generation. Now let me turn to our progress against our strategic objectives. On slide 4. We continued to make progress on all three pillars of our global house bank strategy. Starting with revenue growth, we delivered a compound annual growth rate of 5.7% since 2021. This underscores the benefit of a well-diversified and complementary business mix. Stable NII in our banking book segments was supported by strong non-interest revenues following our investments in our growth initiatives. Looking at the drivers behind commissions and fee income strength in the first six months, we saw growth mainly in our capital-light businesses. We saw particular strong momentum in Origination & Advisory as the market recovered and our franchise is strengthening and gaining market share a trend we expect to continue our initiatives in the Corporate Bank also paying off commissions and fee income grew by 6% with business growth across all regions, which is notably visible in trade finance and lending. We gained market share in our documentary trade business and our structuring capabilities are expanding, which includes increasing contribution from larger transition financing deals and in wealth management and private banking, we grew non-interest revenues from investment products and lending by 11%. We will continue to build on these developments and with business volumes growing, we are confident that our revenue trajectory will remain strong in the second half of the year. First, the impact from the expected NI normalization will be lower than initially anticipated with full year NII in our banking book segment broadly stable to the prior year level, and we will see continued commissions and fee income growth, mainly in Origination & Advisory, Corporate Bank and Asset Management. This puts revenues of EUR30 billion clearly in sight. Additionally, we are highly focused on targeted resource allocation and on driving balance sheet velocity, we continue to deliver on our EUR2.5 billion operational efficiency program, having completed measures, which delivered our expected gross savings of EUR1.5 billion, 60% of our target with around EUR1.2 billion in savings already realized. As part of this program, we have made workforce reductions of 2,700, including 700 FTEs during the second quarter, low, reaching nearly 80% of the planned total through end 2024. In addition, we have reduced contract external staff by approximately 1,100 in 2024. To date, we have clear sight of the remaining savings yet to come from our operational efficiency program, which will offset inflation in our investments in business growth. Our optimization initiatives in Germany are expected to generate savings of around EUR500 million, investments to reduce the complexity of our organization by improving technology and optimizing the workforce across infrastructure will deliver a further EUR550 million, an automation of processes alongside better alignment of our front-to-back setup, including the recent organizational changes will deliver another EUR250 million. This gives us further confidence that we are on track to deliver on our commitment of a quarterly run rate of adjusted cost of around EUR5 billion in 2024, and that we will further reduce this run rate closer to EUR4.9 billion by the end of the year to meet our noninterest expense objectives of around EUR20 billion. Finally, on capital efficiency, we achieved a beneficial equal to a EUR4 billion RWA reduction in the second quarter through data and process improvements. As a result, cumulative RWA reductions from capital efficiency measures reached already EUR19 billion. We have a line of sight on further reductions coming in the second half, and we are working towards meeting or exceeding our EUR25 million to EUR30 billion target. Let me conclude with a few words on our strategy on Slide 5. Our first half results represent another milestone in the progress with our global house bank strategy and set a path to achieving our 2025 target of greater than 10% return on tangible equity. First, we saw strong momentum across all businesses in a more mixed operating environment than we had expected with a better than expected NI trajectory, coupled with our complementary and growing global franchise. We are confident that our strong revenue momentum will deliver revenues of EUR30 billion this year. The investments we have made in our business give us confidence that this run rate will continue as around 75% of revenues come from more predictable base businesses. And we are the go-to European bank for our clients, and we'll continue to build on it by offering clients, full service product and solutions. This builds our confidence that we can achieve our 2025 target of EUR32 billion. Second we are delivering operational efficiencies, which maintain our EUR5 billion run rate in 2024 and will translate into further cost savings, achieving EUR20 billion of noninterest expenses in 2025. Simply put, our revenue growth, combined with our cost reductions will ensure positive operating leverage. Third, we have put material legacy items behind us. And although this results in higher litigation charges this year. Progress we are making should position us to deliver without major surprises in 2025. Fourth, we will see normalization and credit costs next year, closer to the underlying run rate we have this year after overlays and hedging, which will further bolster higher net income. We remain dedicated to creating value for our shareholders. Our earnings power and the progress we have made with capital optimization give us full confidence that we can maintain our trajectory to increase distributions beyond our original goal of EUR8 billion. In respect of the financial years 2021 to 2025, we completed the share repurchase program launched in March, bringing cumulative shareholder distributions through dividends and share repurchases to EUR3.3 billion since 2022. And we will continue to manage capital with the same discipline as over the past several years. To sum up with our business momentum and all the progress made, we have a clear line of sight on our target for IoT of greater than 10% for 2025. With that, let me hand over to James."

        "text": "Thank you, Christian. Let me start with a few key performance indicators on Slide 7 and place that in the context of our 2025 targets, Christian mentioned our continued business momentum, which resulted in revenue growth of 5.7% on a compound basis for the last 12 months relative to 2021. Within our revenue growth target range our reported half year cost income ratio was 78% and return on tangible equity was 3.9%, both impacted by the Postbank takeover litigation provision, excluding the for this provision, the ratios were 69% and 7.8%, showing further improvement compared to 2023. Our capital position remained solid in the second quarter with a CET1 ratio at 13.5% despite absorbing the aforementioned litigation provision. Our liquidity metrics also remained strong. The liquidity coverage ratio was 136% above our target of around 130%, and the net stable funding ratio was 122%. In short, our performance in the period reaffirms our resilience and our confidence in reaching our 2025 targets. With that, let me turn to the second quarter highlights on Slide 8. Group revenues were EUR7.6 billion, up 2% on the second quarter of 2023. Non-interest expenses were EUR6.7 billion, up 20% year on year, driven by the increased litigation charges in the quarter. Nonoperating costs, including litigation charges of EUR1.55 billion beyond the Postbank takeover litigation provision of EUR1.3 billion, there were additional charges of approximately EUR220 million related to a series of legacy items we resolved in the quarter. We also booked EUR106 million of restructuring and severance charges in line with our full year guidance. Adjusted costs increased 2% year on year due to higher compensation and benefits. Provision for credit losses was EUR476 million or 40 basis points of average loans, and I will discuss both adjusted costs and provisions in more detail shortly. We generated a profit before tax of EUR411 million and a net profit of EUR52 million. Our tax rate in the quarter of 87% was impacted by the aforementioned litigation charges, which were largely nondeductible. Excluding these litigation effects. The expected tax rate for the full year continues to be around 30%. In the second quarter, diluted earnings per share was negative $0.28 and tangible book value per share was EUR28.65, up 6% year on year. Let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results. Let me start with a review of our net interest income on Slide 9. And I was essentially flat across all of our key banking book segments at EUR3.4 billion, slightly above prior expectations and II. and each of the banking book segments follow the same trends as seen in the prior quarter. Our base case is that our quarterly NOI run rate will remain broadly stable, and we reiterate that we expect to improve on our earlier guidance for the full year banking book. Ni, the group number, reflecting accounting effects decreased by approximately EUR100 million compared to the previous quarter. This effect is offset by an increase in noninterest revenues and has no overall revenue impact to the group. With that, let's turn to adjusted cost development on Slide 10. Adjusted costs were EUR5 billion for the quarter, up 2% year on year. Year-on-year increase was driven by higher compensation and benefits costs, which were up by 6%, reflecting higher performance related compensation, wage growth as expected and increases in internal workforce after our targeted investments in talent throughout 2023, including numerous. Let's now turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 11. Provision for credit losses in the second quarter was one EUR476 million, equivalent to 40 basis points of average loans. The sequential increase in Stage one and two provisions to EUR35 million was mainly driven by the net effect of overlays and model enhancements, which were partly mitigated by quarter on quarter portfolio movements, Stage three provisions remained at an elevated level, but reduced slightly to EUR441 million. The decrease was mainly driven by the private bank, while provisions in the Investment Bank remained stable and were largely related to commercial real estate exposures. Provisions in the Corporate Bank increased driven by two larger impairment events looking ahead to the second half of the year, we are now seeing some stabilization in the broader U.S. CRE sector. So office US. office remains broadly unchanged. Overall, this should lead to lower provisions compared to the first half, but our office CRE portfolio will continue to be impacted. We also continue to conservatively manage our loan book with lower growth rates including active management of single-name concentration risks through well established comprehensive hedging programs reflecting on these items and considering developments in the first half of the year, we revised our full year guidance for provision for credit losses to be slightly above 30 basis points of average loans. Before we move to performance in our businesses, let me turn to capital on Slide 12. With 13.5%. Our second quarter Common Equity Tier one ratio was up slightly compared to the previous quarter. Cet one capital improved slightly, reflecting lower regulatory capital deduction items and strong net income for the quarter, largely offset by the Postbank takeover litigation provision. Risk-weighted assets increased from business growth, together with higher operational risk RWA, including the impact of the Postbank takeover mitigation provision, mostly offset by reductions from strong delivery of capital efficiency measures. At the end of the second quarter, our leverage ratio was 4.6%, 13 basis points higher compared to the previous quarter 12 basis, 12 basis points of the increase were driven by higher Tier one capital due to the EUR1.5 billion additional Tier one issuance in June. With that, let's now turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 14. Corporate Bank revenues in the second quarter were EUR1.9 billion, essentially flat year on year and up sequentially driven by growth in commissions and fee income and resilient deposit revenues as higher business volumes compensated higher client payouts. We have seen good progress on our growth initiatives to offset the normalization of deposit revenues by further accelerating non-interest revenue growth. Commissions and fee income increased by 5% sequentially and 9% year on year, driven by strong momentum in trade finance and lending across all products as well as in depositary receipts in our trust and agency services business, deposits increased by EUR3 billion in the quarter and are EUR32 billion higher year on year, driven by higher term and site deposits across currencies. The sequential increase in provision for credit losses was driven by Stage one and two provisions after moderate releases in the prior quarter and higher Stage three provisions, which included two larger events in the European and German corporate segment, which were largely covered by risk mitigating measures. Noninterest expenses were essentially flat year on year as higher internal service cost allocations and compensation costs were mostly offset by lower litigation costs. This resulted in a post-tax return on tangible equity of 15% and a cost-income ratio of 62%. I'll now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 15. Revenues for the second quarter were 10% higher year on year, driven by a strong performance in Origination & Advisory revenues and fixed income and currencies were essentially flat year on year reflecting the base effect of a strong prior year quarter. Financing credit trading and Emerging Markets' revenues were essentially flat year on year in credit trading, the non-repeat of strong distress performance in the prior year was offset by strength in the flow business. Thanks to our prior period investments, the macro businesses were both down year on year. The performance in rates primarily reflected the ongoing uncertainty around Central Bank interest rate policies. While FX revenues were impacted by reduced volatility, this was partially mitigated by strong performance in the spot business, benefiting from investments into technology. Moving to Origination & Advisory revenues doubled compared to the prior year, gaining market share both year on year and sequentially, while we maintained the number one rank in our home market debt origination continued to drive performance with an ongoing recovery in the leveraged debt market. While investment grade debt issuance activity remained elevated, advisory revenues were strong and materially higher both year on year and quarter on quarter, benefiting from the previously highlighted investments made into the franchise. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by our third quarter O&A pipeline, which is materially higher year on year. Although the market anticipated slowdown in M&A, M&A industry volumes in the summer and over the third quarter may limit the possibility to outperform the very strong second quarter. Noninterest expenses and adjusted costs were both slightly higher year on year, reflecting the impact of strategic investments, including the numerous acquisition. Provision for credit losses was EUR163 million or 63 basis points of average loans driven by Stage three impairments. Turning to the Private Bank on Slide 16. Pretax profit nearly doubled compared to the second quarter last year. Let me walk you through the drivers. Revenues in the quarter were EUR2.3 billion. This includes higher revenues from investment products and lending, which were more than offset by continued higher funding costs, including the impact of minimum reserves and the group neutral impact of certain hedging costs to the business. Excluding these effects, revenues would have been up by 1% year on year. The sequential revenue development reflects a typical seasonal pattern as some investment activities tend to be concentrated at the beginning of the year. As Christian mentioned before, the Private Bank saw strong business momentum with net inflows into assets under management of EUR7 billion in the quarter, Personal Banking revenues were impacted by the aforementioned higher funding and hedging costs for our lending books, partially offset by resilient deposit revenues in Germany, revenues in wealth management and private banking increased due to higher lending business and investment revenues offset by lower deposit revenues in Germany. Private Bank has continued its transformation with 38 branch closures in the first half of the year, and headcount reductions of more than 1,000 FTEs. In the last 12 months, noninterest expenses declined by 13%, including lower restructuring and severance costs and the non-recurrence of provisions for individual litigation cases. The improvement in adjusted cost of 3% reflects normalized investment spend and transformation benefits, partially offset by still elevated surface remediation costs. We expect these to taper off in the remainder of the year, contributed contributing to a run rate improvement in the second half of the year. The overall quality of our portfolio remained stable. Provision for credit losses benefited from a gain on sale of a nonperforming loan portfolio, but still includes the temporary effects of the operational backlog in personal banking, which are expected to reduce during the second half. Let me continue with Asset Management on Slide 17. My usual reminder, the asset management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Profit before tax improved by 55% from the prior year period, driven by higher revenues and lower noninterest expenses. Revenues increased by 7% versus the prior year. This was primarily from higher management fees of EUR613 million, resulting from higher fees generated by liquid products due to increasing average assets under management. Other revenues were significantly higher, benefiting from lower treasury funding charges and a one-off insurance recovery in the quarter. Performance and transaction fees were significantly lower, driven by performance fees and alternatives. Real estate noninterest expenses were 4% lower due to lower litigation expenses in the quarter, while adjusted costs were essentially flat compared to the prior year. Despite inflationary pressures, passive investments saw a net inflow of EUR9 billion in the quarter due to shifting consumer behavior from active into passive investment strategies. Digital channel distribution is supporting strong growth in Passave, resulting in positive momentum and six consecutive quarters of net inflows. Assets under management decreased by EUR8 billion to EUR933 billion in the quarter. The decrease was attributable to net outflows despite positive market appreciation and FX effects. Net outflows of EUR19 billion were primarily in low margin products in fixed income, cash and advisory services cost income ratio for the quarter declined to 68% and return on tangible equity was 18%, both improving from the prior year quarter. Moving to Corporate and Other on slide 18, Corporate & Other reported a pretax loss of EUR1.5 billion this quarter versus the equivalent pre-tax loss of EUR153 million in the second quarter of 2023, primarily driven by the Postbank takeover litigation provision of EUR1.3 billion. Revenues were positive EUR73 million this quarter. This compares to positive EUR85 million in the prior year quarter. Valuation and timing differences were positive EUR216 million in the quarter, driven by partial reversion of prior period losses and impacts from interest rate moves. This compares to positive EUR252 million in the prior year quarter. The pretax loss associated with legacy portfolios was EUR144 million, driven primarily by litigation charges and other expenses. At the end of the second quarter, risk-weighted assets stood at EUR32 billion, including EUR13 billion of operational risk RWA. In aggregate, RWAs have reduced by EUR9 billion since the prior year quarter. Leverage exposure was EUR36 billion at the end of the second quarter, slightly higher than the prior year quarter. Finally, let me turn to the group outlook on Slide 19, second quarter and first half performance demonstrate the successful execution of our strategy, and we remain confident that our businesses have strong momentum and are positioned for further growth and so our full year 2024 guidance for revenues and adjusted costs have not changed, respectively, at EUR30 billion and around EUR20 billion provision for credit losses for the year are now expected to come in slightly above 30 basis points of average loans. Finally, we have successfully mitigated several hundred headwinds to our capital position, which supports our distribution plan and this remains a key management priority. And as Christian said, our full focus remains on the execution of our strategy and the progress made in 2024 positions us well to achieve our 2025 targets. With that, let me hand back to you on up and we look forward to your questions."

I guess on a headline basis, the momentum is positive, but the mix is changing a little bit more on NI, perhaps a little bit less on fees outside of the Investment Bank. So if we look through for the EUR30 billion for this year and EUR32 billion, let's say, for next year, are you confident on those two numbers in particular, how would you see fees progressing both inside and outside of the IB? And then second, could you give us an update on where your discussions have got to with the ECB regarding any additional capital requirements relating to your leveraged finance business and how you see the outlook for your, let's say, franchise over the coming couple of years."

        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Thank you, Chris. That's a Christian. Thank you very much for your questions. Let me start and as usual, James may want to chip in on your first question on revenues and on kind of your key question, both numbers for 24 and 25. The answer is a clear. Yes, and let me start with 2024 and you have seen the H1 numbers, to be honest, I'm really happy with that with the 15.4 billion because all businesses have actually delivered. And the nice thing is if I now go over the next quarters and let me start with the predictable or more predictable divisions, i.e., the corporate bank, the private bank asset management, you can actually see that the momentum and the numbers which we have seen in the first two quarters are very, very good guidance for Q3 and Q4. I would even say that for the Private Bank and Asset Management, I even expect a slightly better development in H2 versus H1, given also that what James said in his prepared remarks on NII, but also in particular, because of the inflows and the assets under management behave in a very satisfactory way. On the corporate bank, I think a number of you know, which is around 1.9 billion given all the what I can see from the mandates we win is something which we can also plan for Q3 and Q4 that I would really say those three divisions are really having a good momentum. And yes, we benefit a bit more from a better NI than we expected at the start of the year. But even next to that, the underlying fee business behaving very well on the investment banking side, I absolutely believe that overall the I think the trajectory which we have seen over the last years in terms of market share wins in terms of stability of revenues and in terms of also predictability of revenues. If you think about the financing businesses, which we have also show me that the second half will be a very satisfactory one. Honestly, July started so far, pretty pretty good in the Investment Bank. And what makes me confident in the O&A business could be that the summer is a little bit slower in terms of M&A business than what we have seen in Q2. But overall, the market will further recover. We have gained 70 basis points in market share in the first half year. We believe that this will also be the case throughout the year. And to be honest, the investments which we have done in the origination and advisory business are really only starting to pay off. So the new people which we hired last year, they are gaining more and more momentum. So to be honest, I even expect that we get more market share in an overall market, which from a fee pool is increasing over the next 12 to 18 months. So that makes me confident that starting with the EUR15.4 billion revenue number, that 30 billion is absolutely inside, and I'm highly confident that we achieve that. Now 25. The first thing I would like to say it's for the first time. So to say, Chris, other than '24 and '23, they're both kind of income streams. And I and fee income are both going into an increasing direction. So it's different than in the former years where we always had one of these streams, which was kind of decreasing in 25, we have sort of, say, two positive growing engines, and that obviously helps us as a start. Now if I there go and actually through the business on the corporate bank, we think that 25 would be another increase over 20 for Y. because we can simply see the number of mandates transactions we are doing and the investments which we had in particular in our platform business in our payment businesses are paying off. And so therefore, we gave you also in the prepared remarks, the wins which we had in Q2, all that and the feedback we have from the client's point into another increase in 25. And again, the ENI is behaving even better than than we thought at the start of this year. Private Bank. I'm clearly up next year why we always told you that we have a tailwind in NII in 25 over 24. Secondly, we are obviously benefiting from the constant inflows into assets under management. And we don't believe that there is any change in the second half of the year. So the starting point is even a different one, similar actually in asset management. Also in those areas like alternatives and passive, where Stefan, who accesses a focus on, we are growing. And on the Investment Bank, actually, I do believe we will grow in all three areas. Number one, we have made further investments into our trading business, in particular, regionally in the US. We have new people starting now as we speak and we will grow that business the trading business over there. Secondly, I refer back to the remarks on the O. and A. business. We expect the fee market share to increase next year further increase over over this year. Secondly, market shares will grow with those investments, which we have done also talking about numerous. And thirdly, the financing business is not only stable but if I look at the income and revenue streams, which we have planned for next year, actually also an increase, all of that from a very encouraging behavior in 2024 makes me absolutely confident that we can achieve the EUR32 billion next year. So the second question on the ECB, to be honest, a, you know, I have seen that portfolio, the leverage lending portfolio now for the last 15 years. And to be honest, it always behaved very well because I think our risk appetite and the way we have managed. Our risk has demonstrated that we are in very good control of that business. You also know Chris, and this is not a secret that a few years ago, we had started the discussions with the ECB. We got a capital add on at that point time of 20 basis points, which was reduced last year by five basis, five basis points. I know that there is a discussion between the industry and the ECB. I take it as a very positive signal that the ECB is now reviewing the comments and our arguments from the industry. And therefore, you know, also obviously, with all outside opinions, which we get for our portfolio, I feel very confident with the level of provisions we have with the way we manage it. It's a it's a key business for us. It's a core business of ours that will not change. And I'm sure we will also come to a solution there which shows that we have managed it in a fair way. I don't know, James, whether you want to add. James von Moltke, Deutsche Bank AG - President, Chief Financial Officer and Responsible for the Asset Management, Member of the Management Board All good."

I was wondering if we could have an update on what is your total distribution targets? Because you committed to distribute above EUR8 billion of capital, but could we have a bit more clarity by how much you expect to exceed this 8 billion mark? And also timing wise, what should we expect notably for the share buyback is a top-up completely excluded for H2 and what about the pace in 2025? And regarding litigation, what should we expect regarding the litigation provision H2 through more globally? You have now reduced quite significantly turnkey or contingent liabilities. So I was wondering should we expect a lower litigation cost run rate for the future rates for the future years? Thank you."

        "text": "Thank you very much. And let let me start, Nicolas and then James will I think comment on both question on the distribution because that is really important for me. There is no change in guidance. We will distribute more than 8 billion in the timeframe from 21 to 25. Nothing has changed, obviously, from a timing point of view, as we said end of April with the with the item on the Postbank provision of EUR1.3 billion, which we had to digest. We always said that we now need to have two quarters actually where we show operating strengths where we restore capital. And to be honest, I'm really happy of what has been done in this bank. We are at 13.5% capital. We have created excess capital. Also in the last quarter, we are clearly above, so to say the 13.2%, we have created excess capital, but I want to show to the market another quarter of this operating strength. And with the with the comments I just made on revenues with costs, which are absolutely in control, we are around the EUR5 billion we have our clear way to the next year. I'm absolutely confident that we show another very strong quarter in Q three, which generates capital. And then obviously we are back in the progress process and we will go back and enter into discussions. That is clear for me. But I always signaled that after the Postbank litigation, which the bank digested, we really powered through this we want to show too good quarters. Number one is done, and I'll tell you, number two will come."

      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Thanks, Christian. Nicola, thanks for the question. Look, I'd just echo Christian's comments. We've returned almost EUR1.6 billion already this year through the capital actions that we took in the second quarter. We were, I think, very successful offsetting the impact of the Postbank provision and our step off into the second half of 13.5% on the CET1 ratio is a good starting place. Your question about the trajectory going forward. If I refer you to slide 22 of our investor deck, we've tried to be as clear as possible on what we've referred to as baseline expectations. And so if you look at that on the dividend, we've paid out this year 883 and the $0.675 next year would be about 1.3 billion. The EUR1 dividend that we intend to pay out in 26 in respect of 25 would be another nearly 2 billion. And then if you trace the the buyback sort of trajectory forward. And let's just assume for a second, 50% increase a year, the next two numbers in that series would be about EUR1 billion and 1 billion and a half cumulatively that would add to slightly above 9 billion. And so that's what we're working to deliver to shareholders. As we, as Christian mentioned, build excess capital in the back half of the year, we want to be positioned to achieve those those types of payout. Now we did make a sort of an editorial change to the to page 22 really trying to kind of separate a little bit the share buybacks from the the payout ratio discussion because to some extent we look at the payout ratio as a minimum, not a maximum and hence building excess capital into the back half of the year can position us to preserve that buyback trajectory even if the payout ratio goes goes north of 50%. And so that's the hopefully clarity and on what the baseline expectations are. And just the last thing to say last time, you saw that slide there was this idea of top-ups. And obviously, the unexpected provision in 24, at least for now is taken away the idea of a top-up in 24. But we haven't given up on top-ups in 25 and 26. It depends on sort of all of the ins and outs in the capital plan. But I'd just echo Christian's confidence that we I think we've been able to show that the Postbank provision did not take us off stride, and we remain committed to the to the so the profile we show on page 22 if I go to your litigation question, look, obviously there's been a and a transition between the contingent liability number and the and the balance sheet provision driven by the Postbank litigation takeover litigation provision, but actually not only that provision of some other items also move between the two sort of the off balance sheet and the on-balance sheet accounts. As we said, last quarter. The profile has changed pretty significantly, if you like, of risks that are still unknown and we are committed to continuing the work over the back half of the year to put ourselves in a position for, I would call it dramatically lower litigation provisions and regulatory enforcement actions going forward. Really we'd like to be in a position at the end of the year to have what I call is as clean a slate as possible going into 25 and sustainably. So because if you like, we'll address the the unknown elements of the known items. And as we look to the future sort of the pipeline of new things coming in that we can see and by the way, the benefits of all the investments we've made in controls should should give us much more confidence about the outlook going forward."

So more like 25, 30 basis points in the second half and what you've assumed on commercial real estate AmerGen, that number and as you sort of like set in 2025, you expect on loan losses to normalize. Would that be a 25, 30 basis points or that 20 basis points you mentioned in the past. And then just on CapEx, I just wondered if you can give us some more clarity on the expectation with the benefit from the delay of the FITB., what it could mean for for the 15 billion you previously guided? And would you consider this and your distribution as an extra benefit? And then sorry, just one last question on the dividend and the distributions, if I may. If you have a payout rate, if the 68 dividend per share, which corresponds to more than 50%, am I right in from your previous comments to understand that come the focus is the absolute distribution rather than the payout ratio. Thank you very much."

        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Thank you, Anke, and I'm happy to take all three, Chris, you may want to add, but look at the CLP. guidance change, I would think of it as more related to what has already happened in the year in the first half than then about our outlook for the second half. And we've had a number of events really to corporates default and then an overlay that we booked in Q2 that have taken us slightly north of what we'd anticipated when we spoke to you three months ago. And while you're always a little bit looking in a crystal ball. We've been we've been in a granular way looking through the portfolio, including commercial real estate to have a view on the second half. You'll recall that I've talked in the past of a 24 run rate closer to say, EUR350 million per quarter that we that we felt was sort of present and that in a sense is, let's say, EUR100 million of CRE. sitting on top of EUR250 million of ordinary course run rates that is in the portfolio. Now let's start with the last point, we still see the same stability in our own underlying portfolios in both the retail and the corporate portfolios. So we haven't seen a deterioration on top of that. We've seen, as I mentioned, a handful of defaults and also an overlay that we booked in CRE. I recall that we've seen a stabilization in 24 and relative to the deterioration that was taking place last year that actually persisted in the second quarter. What is perhaps a little bit worse? Is that the the sort of beginnings of a recovery that I might have expected three months ago. That hasn't happened yet. It doesn't change our view, frankly, of the direction of travel and that essentially over time, the new defaults and the valuation adjustments that remain in that portfolio begin to sort of burn out some CRE. If you if you go back to the fourth quarter results, we'd said to expect about $450 million in 24, consistent with our 23 performance that is probably worsened ever so slightly, call it 50, maybe EUR75 million in terms of our expectation, but not dramatically. As I say, the larger part of the change in guidance is what's already happened in the year around a couple of corporate items in the corporate defaults in the and the overlay and on FRTB, obviously good news for the industry in Europe because I think it would have put us at a competitive disadvantage if the U.S. were not to go forward and Europe to go forward. So we think it's a sensible change. It essentially cuts in half just simple math. We had given you say, EUR15 billion of RWA increase from CRR. three as of January 1st next year. I'd now build about 7.5 into the models and move the other $7.5 billion into the 1st of January 2026. So that's obviously helpful in our capital path. Helpful to us in terms of building up this excess capital, I just talked about I'm looking into the 25 distributions and then that feeds nicely into your third question, which is which is which is binding, we think of the 50% payout intention as you know, if you like a floor, it's what we would then accrue to during the year based on the interim profit recognition and because of the impact on profitability in 24 coming from the Postbank provision, that payout ratio, I think we'll easily cover our dividend and maybe some amount of repurchase. But what we want to do is put ourselves in a position of being an excess capital to to fund and then the rest of the repurchase in 25. And hence, to your point, we wouldn't view the 50% payout as being binding again."

Tom, I wanted to come back briefly on cost in your remarks, Christian, you talked about the EUR4.9 billion run rate potentially at the end of the year. And I just wanted to see how you think about the flexibility that that offers next year to get your cost income guidance from? If you can talk maybe around is there flexibility to run below EUR20 billion in that sense, I'm considering you're indicating a lower number for the end of the year, even if it's adjusted versus stated and how that thinking is around and confident around the cost income guidance. And the second question is related to provisions again, I wanted to just dig a little bit deeper after anchors question. The detailed answer in respect to CRE. Clearly, the assumptions are that CRE will stabilize? It sounded like that come in 2025. And I wanted to just get a better understanding what assumptions you're making. If you can talk a little bit about the input assumptions, price, the price performance and CREU. S and default rates, are you assuming on a macro level in CRE? And so we get a better understanding. And lastly, if I just may on leverage loans, you kind of answered the question, but I also wanted to see if there's any leverage loan additional provision requirement. Does that mean there could be a buyback push back?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Perfect. Okay. And let me start with the cost answer. First of all, I think most important is that we stick to our target and that we show you that we deliver on that likely like I think we have demonstrated from Q4 23 when we started with the EUR5.3 billion of quarterly cost that we come down to 5.0, which we have done now looking ahead and what is in the pipeline of additional cost measures to be executed over the next quarters in terms of achieving the EUR2.5 billion of overall cost cuts. And I'm very confident that we will come to the EUR4.9 billion of quarterly costs at the end of Q4, Q4 starting of Q1. So this is for us where we are focusing on in this regard. We have obviously put all the cost measures into so-called key deliverables, which we are tracking on a biweekly basis in the Management Board. And we can actually see that with all the investments we have done with all the also headcount cuts, which we have executed in Q1 and Q2. We are delivering on that in Q3 and Q4. And therefore, I'm confident that the run rate of EUR4.9 billion, which we need for 2025 will be achieved, to be honest in this regard key. And just to give you a little bit of a seal the hardest core quarter to achieve the EUR5 billion was actually Q2, right from the start of the year where and why? Because all the salary increases actually came into Q2 we had a lot of the staff reductions to be done in Q2 where these people were still so to say on our payroll and both we have managed, i.e., you saw the number of reduced workforce, not only internally, but also externally what we managed to do in Q2. And secondly, we digested the wage and salary increases, i.e., the annual tariff increases which we which we digested. And now we are working down these key deliverables, as I just said. And that gives me all the confidence that we are coming to the run rate of EUR4.9 billion. Now what further flexibility do we have in that? The EUR4.9 billion is obviously then also correlated to sort of say our revenue aspirations and the revenue target I laid out, you know, from our previous discussions that there is always certain flexibility also on the cost number in terms of flexibility when it comes to less volumes when it comes to variable comp when it comes to technology investments. And obviously, this is all in our hand and therefore, I don't want to rule out at all that there is further flexibility. But for me, given there where the momentum of the bank is on the revenue side, I have all all eyes focused on the EUR4.9 billion. And here I can give you my full confidence that we will achieve that because or the underlying structural cost reductions are actually in time, in plan, in execution."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "And turning to your question on provisions and the impact of CRE, I maybe I can draw your attention to Slide 34 and the and the investment in the IR deck. Now this is where I had guided that the next in the series would be down in Q2. And so as always, predictions about the future are a slightly uncertain science but we've sort of traveled more or less at the level we had in Q4 and Q1. So the recovery that I mentioned earlier didn't come as quickly as as I had expected and look, by the way, the one 30 in Q2 actually had some some impact of the overlay. So so if you take that out, we were at one 23 essentially flat for the last two quarters. Now what gives us confidence about the direction of travel here? Really two things. One is that the if we look at the portfolio in a granular way. So loan-by-loan, which loans in which loans do we see there a possibility of future defaults? That number is declining. And so so the if you like, the risk content that remains in the portfolio, it is declining. And but what drove the kind of missed my expectations this quarter was more that the existing the defaulted portfolio, our estimate is my estimation of lifetime losses increased in the quarter. So that also will find a level and stabilize it at some point. So I had hoped that and expected that we'd probably be closer to 100 in there in the second quarter. Let's see how this develops in the quarters to come. But given the way portfolios like this perform, you can the downslope can be can be quite dramatic. And then on leverage lending, look, we we believe our provisions or the allowance for loan losses is prudent and adequate for the risks we see in the portfolio. And we are always open to and taking on feedback from our internal AQR views, our auditors and also the regulators when they come into to review the portfolios and see. And at the end of the day, it is for us to determine on the basis of the accounting rules, what the appropriate provision is. We'll continue to monitor and adapt dynamic way, but we think our practices are good and we will continue to engage in a constructive way and with the supervisors on that on that dialogue."

And then secondly, on SRP.s, which is obviously becoming quite a popular tool for banks these days. Could you just give us some color on the potential CET1 benefit over the next year and then maybe quantify or help us understand the size of the overall opportunity here, which as an outsider, I guess I'm thinking about it in terms of size of the scope of assets that are generally earning below the regulatory cost of capital. Thank you."

        "text": "Thanks, Tom. And two interesting questions. Look, loan growth has been more sluggish incoming than we'd expected as you've heard on our calls for the past year or so. That said, we did have loan growth in the second quarter. And so the kind of first encouraging sign we have $2 billionof loan growth this quarter. And we think that the kind of indicators of increasing activity are there. And there's certainly demand in some of the more more structured lending areas some. So we think that that recovery is starting. And in the retail portfolios in particular, there's still sort of a relatively slow environment in German mortgages and our portfolio have traded slightly. But again, there I think we've found a floor and can grow from here. And on the deposit side, really encouraging sort of performance, especially in corporate bank, but we also see in the private bank have a clear ability to raise deposits at a pricing that is that is attractive. And so you may see a leveling out a little bit of the deposit growth in the back half of the year. But but we think the volumes there generally are encouraging in terms of healthy growth, frankly, on both sides of the balance sheet going forward. If I look at SRT. look for us, some of our risk transfer programs are 20 years old. So we've been at this for a while and we have good structured programs, and we have a great level of engagement with the investors in our structures that have been with us for a long time. And we're sort of constantly on the lookout for portfolios where we think they can be more efficiently held off of the bank's balance sheet than on our balance sheet. \\ Therefore, I would say the scope isn't dramatic, but they're still there's still things we look at. And you've seen that as part of the, you know, program we've had for capital efficiency of where we were after 25 to 30, as you've seen in the past year or so, securitization has been part of that growing our SRT. programs or the funded credit-linked note programs we have is also being part of that. So I think a marginal contribution from here and we're always looking, but we have a reasonably sizable benefit as things stand from those types of tougher types of structures. One last comment to make at the risk of going long as we get into the CRR. three world and the impact of the output floor. Obviously, there's a there's a whole new sort of Vista, if you like, of assets that we may look to take off our balance sheet because we'll be solving for another variable. So in the past, it's been managing concentration risk and to a lesser extent, RWA going forward, it will be those two things plus plus the impact on the output floor of different asset classes."

And could you please give us a bit more detail a bit more color on how quickly the fee line can grow and what initiatives you have underway to really control this and drive this in the next quarters and in 25 in particular. And so that would be my first question. And then secondly, and you talked about a loan growth dynamics? What about asset and margins? How are those evolving in your main products, please? Thank you."

        "text": "Yes, let me take a let me take the first question, Julia, on the private bank. And actually, it's a first of all, a continuous improvement on the fee business, a grocer in the private bank. I'm kind of in particular, when I look to the future a quarter over quarter and why? Because we have a constant inflow in our assets under management, by the way, domestically as well as internationally. And by the way, also and this is very nice, not only sort of say in the private bank and wealth management business, but also in the personal banking business in Germany. Secondly, I think for the private bank. And if we if we think about the overall profitability, there is a huge focus. Now on turning around the personal banking business in the private bank in Germany, that obviously, given all the integration work, which we which we are doing and which we have done in particular last year with the IT transformation had an unacceptable return on equity. So far. But if I look actually at the strategy from Claudio, how we will digitalize this business, how we actually will make this business in particular for the investment and fee-related business a business, which is there for 19 million clients and in particular, for the 50 million Post Bank clients, I expect actually a good growth coming from this personal banking and at the same time, we are now realizing the fruits of integrating the IT, i.e., the costs are coming down. And here we are talking, like we said in the previous calls about a 500 million cost reduction just as a direct cost in the private bank as a result of the integration. So it's a constant, a growth across the subdivisions in the private bank. But the real lever is actually bringing the personal bank in Germany with a clear plan to an acceptable return on equity over the next 12 to 18 months, which is then obviously also a huge lever for the overall Group profitability."

        "text": "So maybe I could add, and this is also a little bit in answer to Chris's question earlier, which was about sort of fee and commission engines outside the Investment Bank, obviously, just in the Investment Bank, a big part of the story this year and next year is is advisory and underwriting fees where we think the momentum, the wallet growth is there and there's an opportunity that we're executing on to increase our market share. But if you go away from the Investment Bank. As Christian just said, you know, the the private bank earns commissions and fee revenues in brokerage and investment management fees and commissions and asset management does the same on the investment management side and you have visibility into those revenue sources from the AUM increases or development over time. And then you can also you can also be helped or hindered by the market levels, but the visibility is there. And then in the corporate bank and you've got fees on loan inception, loan processing processing, you have payment activity, custody activity again, sort of an asset driven trust and agency services. And again, the visibility into those revenue sources is high, including based on the the RFP process and the implementation of new business that we win. And so so as I say, the visibility into these revenue sources is strong. And based on our current outlook, we can see some of these lines continuing the types of growth rates this year so far, which has been 12% each quarter and for the half extending into next year. On the and on the spread side, there, too we've been surprised to the upside this year, frankly, on both sides of the balance sheet. So as we've talked about, deposit margins have been better than anticipated as the pass through and continues to outperform. On the loan side. The same has been true. The spreads in the front book have been better than our than we anticipated to be fair a bit mixed on the private bank and corporate bank and investment bank. There's been reasonably healthy spreads and new lending in the front book. And those that's that sort of margin expansion has contributed to the to the better than expected net interest income than we had anticipated. And by the way, the other driver of the NI outperformance is also spreads on our unsecured debt. And so so all of those engines are helping sustain this year that net interest income line and contribute to the expected growth next year."

        "text": "Yes, good afternoon and thanks for the presentation. I have three questions, please. First of all, on RWA reduction, I think you have achieved now EUR19 billion in total RAB reduction as a result of the optimization program. And could you give us a sense of the timing of the remaining reductions to get to your EUR25 billion targets. Is that largely coming through in the second half of this year or some of that should be in 25? And then the second question is on share buybacks. Just referring to your slide 22 and the 50% per annum growth in share buybacks, I think the original expectation certainly by the market was and a higher total amount of buyback in 2024 on which the increase into next year would have been obviously quite substantial. My question is, are we looking at a 50% increase versus the 675 million for the buyback next year? Or should we think of a potentially larger increase due to the scrapped second tranche of the buyback in 24. And finally, the last question is on the Corporate Bank loss provisions. And could you give us any sense of these single cases or single corporate events are they reflective of any deterioration in the overall asset quality in the broader corporate sector. Thank you."

Look at first of all, we're very pleased with the progress there and credit to the teams that have been working so hard to drive this optimization. And, you know, broadly speaking, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, I would hope that we could achieve another 2 billion in Q3. And there I think we've got good line of sight to that, maybe a little bit more. And if we achieve the same in Q4, I would be pleased. So if we got to say 4 billion incremental this year, bringing us to 23 billion, maybe 24, that would be that would be good performance, which, to your point, leaves five or six next year to get to 30 and potentially there's upside beyond that. And that obviously is helpful in driving the excess capital creation that I talked about earlier. So So assume for modeling purposes, 4 billion this year and at least six next year."

        "text": "Yes, it was what was taken out. And in 24, I think that the consensus number was that the second buyback authorization could be something in the order of four to 500 million. This year, and that was actually a fair assumption. And absent the litigation provision, I think we would have been in a good position to seek that. But I want to be clear the baseline was intended always to be off the in this case, the six 75 with potential top-ups, depending on the level of excess capital in each year. And so I want to reiterate the baseline expectation that something that management's working towards to deliver and and let's see what whether there's room for the top-ups. We certainly haven't given up on the idea that there wouldn't could be top-ups. And those top-ups would take us from the call it 9.2 that's implied by the by the the progression and to something beyond that again, it underscores why it is that we say we've got confidence and exceeding the 8.8 billion."

        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "And on the asset quality in the corporate book, I think James already said that, no, there is no deterioration. To be honest. The two cases James were referring to. It's actually sort of say, dominated by one case in Europe, but also here? Yes, we have to have we had to build a loan-loss provision. But I think overall, we should also not forget that the risk management overall has actually worked quite well because we have a substantial coverage actually from a CLO point of view, which again, brings me back to the point that, yes, you see a slightly elevated loan-loss provision number, but the real run rate if we take overlays out. And if I also take this into account, the real run rate of loan loss provision is, in my view, actually the normal stock of run rate of the EUR250 million plus a quarterly number, which always can happen. And you can now say it's 75, it's EUR100 million but that brings me also to the confidence because we don't see from a rating point of view from a watch list point of view from upgrades versus downgrades. We don't see any material deterioration, also not in the German mid-cap book. Brings me to the confidence that actually a number of EUR1.3 billion is a number where I'm absolutely confident that there should be a run rate for Deutsche Bank in terms of loan-loss provisions per year."

        "text": "Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have just two left, please. Starting with the private bank, you mentioned an NPL sale. Can you tell us roughly how big this was notionally the terms and whether there was actually a P&L profit or loss on the back of this sale? And the second question relates to the valuation and timing differences in your corporate center, which have been mostly positive in recent quarters? And can we think of this as here balance, which is still negative? I think you are still working yourself out of the spectrum neutral or is it actually now a positive and overall balancing there's a risk that eventually that normalizes down to neutral with negative effects in coming quarters? Thank you very much."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Thanks for the question, Stefan. So briefly, I don't know the notional of the NPL sale, but but in round numbers, think of us as having a CLP benefit of about EUR25 million in the quarter on the sale, which was offset by incremental CLPR., continued drag from the operational disruptions of about the same amount. So the call it 150 that you see in the second quarter is a pretty good indication of the run rate and going into the second half of the year in the private bank, given we wouldn't necessarily expect will the drag from operational items. We do expect to go away and potentially reverse in the second half of the year and the P&L sale, the NPL sale wouldn't necessarily repeat either on the valuation timing differences, I'd really call out two elements. The first is pull to par in the investment portfolio. And that has has a short term and a sort of a more medium term element in the short term, some of the pull to par in Q2 was actually Q1 losses given given the market movements, and we expect some more of that to bleed into earnings in the second half of the year. So there's a short-term element. It's actually also. And given the way the hedges work, there's also a longer-term element which we expect to come out over a much longer period of time. So yes, in a sense. There's a there's a a positive balance, call it that way that is that is to come there. There's also the impact of our, you know, our swap funding book and which is which is helpful. It today represents it's driven by the differential between euro and dollar rates. That's remained by and large supportive. And how that trends from here will depend on the on the on the gap between the two rates. So So different parts, I don't see it disappearing in a heartbeat, but some but over time would moderate. Let's say in a two, three year time horizon."

It is reviewing its process. And I told you that we already were subject to a capital add-on. We feel with all the information we have that we have provisioned in an absolute accurate way, and I think we have shown that over the long term. And therefore, overall, we feel comfortable, but I think it would be it would be the wrong thing. Now to speculate about anything, I think the direction of the ECB, I find that constructive, we have constructive discussions and then let's see what happens. But the direction last year that reduced from 20 basis points to 15 also shows that there was at least some confidence in our processes. Perfect."

And then my second question is just on the Russia case you mentioned in the notes. And could you confirm that there's no financial impact in this quarter. And in fact, there's no provision booked because it's fully offset by the claim. And just how confident you are in that? Because other banks involved seem to be taking charges relating to that case."

And so I'll refer you on the first question to page 42 of the of the interim report and the main driver that we're referring to is what we call the expected loss shortfall. And that's but but in that disclosure, you see the various regulatory capital deduction items. The LSF. has been something that's increased significantly year on year, reflecting the portfolio changes that we introduced last year and some of the I'll call it seasoning of those parts of those models and yes, it's one of the areas that we're now looking at and how we can mitigate and manage. And so that helped us on the regulatory capital deduction items in the quarter. Is just learning which exposures drive the LSF. and how we can we can mitigate that. And to your question about direction of travel, actually, the next step will be up as one more model kind of becomes live in that world. But then we, I think would be at a sort of a steady state level and we will work to to optimize from that. On Russia, we essentially booked offsetting provision and an indemnification asset. And so we feel we're appropriately the risk is appropriately reflected on the balance sheet and the fee evolution of the cases has been overall in line with our expectations. So we don't see sort of a change in the risk position there and therefore no change in how it's reflected in the financial statements. Our expectation is that that claim will be prosecuted and in a way that enables us to enforce the the indemnification claim."

I assume it isn't Tom related to the structural hedge that and you can do in terms of providing more color on why such a big step-up coming through from 26 to 27 are in your interest rate sensitivity guidance?"

We actually the first time when we prepared this slide, I was surprised because it looked like the sensitivity and expanded. And I I missed that we'd moved it forward by a year. And so that gives you an indication of how successful we've been, frankly in closing down the rate sensitivity on our balance sheet. So 27 being larger is simply a function that are that are our hedge portfolio, you know, are less of it goes out that far in time. And what you'd expect to see us do as we roll over the hedges is bring more of that in and reduce the sensitivity further down the down the track and equivalently the 90 million in 27 on EUR, I would I would expect to see go down unless there's some change in our in our view of the, you know, of the likely future path of interest rates. And so in short, I'm I'm happy with the way that we've managed the sort of ALM challenges of the last several years. And I think, again, it's one of the things that gives us confidence and visibility into revenues in the future is the success of our hedging and the impact of the of the hedge rollover and over the next several years."

I would like to remind you that all participants will be in a listen only mode and the conference is being recorded. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast. At this time, it\u2019s my pleasure to hand over to Ioana Patriniche, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2024 results call. As usual, our Chief Executive Officer, Christian Sewing will speak first, followed by our Chief Financial Officer, James von Moltke. The presentation, as always, is available to download on the Investor relations section of our website at db.com Before we get started, let me just remind you that the presentation contains forward-looking statements which may not develop as we currently expect. We therefore ask you to take notice of the precautionary warning at the end of our materials. With that, let me hand over to Christian.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you Ioana, and a warm welcome from me. I'm delighted to be discussing our third quarter and nine month results with you today. These show our ongoing strong operating performance, further reinforcing our confidence in our 2024 ambitions and 2025 financial targets. I'm particularly pleased that our continued intense client engagement has supported momentum in all businesses. This enabled us to generate revenues of \u20ac22.9 billion in the first nine months, putting us well on track towards our goal of \u20ac30 billion for the year. We recorded the third successive quarter of adjusted costs at \u20ac5 billion, inline with our 2024 guidance underpinning our forward trajectory. We are pleased with the settlements we achieved in August and September in the Postbank takeover litigation matter, equivalent to around 60% of the total claims by value. This resulted in a litigation release that supported our reported pretax profit of \u20ac2.3 billion, up over \u20ac500 million year-on-year, and our reported post tax return on tangible equity of 10.2% in the third quarter. For the first nine months, our reported RoTE stood at 6%, excluding the Postbank takeover litigation related impact, RoTE was 7.8%, up from 7% in the prior year period. Asset quality remains stable despite the sequential increase in our provision for credit losses, which James will go through in more detail. Importantly, we expect provisions to reduce towards more normalized levels going forward, particular in expectation of improvements in commercial real estate over the next quarters. Our CET1 ratio of 13.8% reflects our strong organic capital generation. This puts us on a clear path to distribute capital to our shareholders as planned and we have now sought authorization from the ECB for our next share buyback. Let me now discuss in more detail some of the drivers of our nine month results on slide three. Disciplined execution of our Global Hausbank strategy is driving steadily improving performance and operating leverage. Pre provision profit grew by 17% year-on-year to \u20ac7 billion in the first nine months, with operating leverage of 5%, both excluding the Postbank takeover litigation related impact. Growth was driven by both revenue momentum and cost discipline. Nine months revenues grew 3% year-on-year, with around 75% of revenues coming from more predictable income streams. Reported non-interest revenues were up 14% year-on-year with continued strong growth in commissions and fee income of 9%. This demonstrates that our strategy of growing our capital light business is paying off. At the same time, net interest income in our key banking book segments remain stable and better than anticipated at the beginning of the year. We remain focused on expense discipline, keeping our adjusted cost to \u20ac15.1 billion or \u20ac5 billion per quarter as we continue to offset inflation while allowing for investments by delivering savings from our operational efficiency program. Our cost income ratio, excluding Postbank litigation related impacts, improved to 69% from 73% year-on-year. Now let's look at the franchise achievements across our business on slide four. The corporate bank increased the number of deals won with multinational clients by 18% compared to the first nine months of the prior year. We also had strong momentum in commissions and fee income, which grew by 5% across all regions. At the same time, NII remained resilient, supported by continued pricing discipline and deposit growth of 8% year-on-year. In the investment bank we increased activity so far this year with our priority institutional clients by 11%, demonstrating the ongoing commitment and focus of our business and coverage teams in supporting our clients. Nine months revenues in fixed income and currencies were up 5% year-on-year, supported by a 5% increase in financing revenues, even compared to a strong prior year. Looking at the third quarter, FIC demonstrated a strong performance and was up by 11% year-on-year. Origination & Advisory grew revenues by 58% and increased its global market share year-to-date compared to the full year 2023. While we maintained our number one ranking in our home market. The Private Bank sees further momentum with \u20ac27 billion of net inflows and grew non-interest revenues by 5% year-on-year, driven by higher margin products in volumes across both client segments. The division continues to transform its personal banking unit with around 50 branch closures year-to-date and more to come. The business also announced to a further optimization of our Deutsche Bank branch network in the quarter which will start next year. Asset Management grew assets under management by \u20ac67 billion year-to-date to \u20ac963 billion. This was boosted by continued strong inflows into our diverse product suite, which should support future revenues. The Group also made progress on its sustainability strategy including ESG rating upgrades. In October, S&P\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Assessment was upgraded to 66 and is now within the top decile of the financial industry. The MSCI rating was upgraded to AA from A. Let me turn to our progress against our strategic objectives on slide five. Our third quarter results demonstrates our continued progress across all three pillars of our Global Hausbank strategy. Starting with revenue growth our well diversified and complementary business mix delivered a compound annual growth rate of 5.6% since 2021, in line with our upgraded target range, and we expect it to increase from here. For the remainder of the year we anticipate continued momentum in commissions and fee income, driven by ongoing high client engagement and our franchise strengths, while NII remains stable. This gives us full confidence in reaching our revenue ambition of \u20ac30 billion for the full year 2024, providing a strong step off into 2025. Moving to costs, we continue to deliver on our Operational Efficiency program, having completed measures with delivered or expected gross savings of \u20ac1.7 billion, almost 70% of our target with around \u20ac1.5 billion in savings already realized. We have made further progress on workforce reductions, including 600 FTEs in the third quarter, bringing the total number to more than 90% of the 2024 year-end target. The achieved progress to date and efficiency still in the pipeline will support our adjusted cost run rate for the remainder of 2024 and further reductions in 2025 to meet our objective of around \u20ac20 billion in non-interest expenses while continuing to invest in business growth, technology and controls. Lastly, we delivered a further benefit of \u20ac3 billion of RWA equivalent reductions in the third quarter, driven by data and process improvements. This brings total RWA equivalent reductions from capital efficiency measures to \u20ac22 billion, which puts us inside of our end 2025 target range of \u20ac20 billion to \u20ac30 billion more than one year early. We expect to achieve further reductions from securitizations as well as data and process enhancements, and we continue to work on finding further incremental optimization opportunities to exceed our target. Let me conclude with a few words on our strategy on slide six. Our operating performance in the first nine months shows that our Global Hausbank strategy positions us well to serve our client\u2019s needs and continues to deliver growth and profitability. We have firm confidence in reaching our RoTE of at least 10% next year. To be clear, our focus remains on us, our strategy and financial targets, unlocking further value for shareholders through the measures we have underway. Looking at revenues into 2025, we expect continued franchise momentum and our capital light businesses to drive further growth, harvesting investments we have made and are still making. In the corporate bank, we expect further growth in commissions and fee income from our investments in our fee based institutional business as well as our payment platforms. FIC is expected to show further improvements into next year, benefiting from our investments into the franchise in both existing and adjacent businesses, as well as continued strengthen in financing. In ONA, we have a clear value proposition to our clients supported by our investments, which should help us to further increase our market share in what we expect to be a growing market environment with further benefit of new hires still to come. At the same time, the private bank anticipates growing non-interest income, mainly from investment products, predominantly in wealth management and private banking, further supported by NII. Within our Asset Management business, we expect to benefit from higher assets under management levels this year, which should lead to an increase in management fees in 2025. Additionally, we anticipate positive flows into the Alternatives business and continued growth in passive including X-trackers. These drivers underline our confidence in achieving our revenue goal of \u20ac32 billion in 2025. Turning to costs, we have taken decisive action to put legacy items behind us, substantially reducing our risk profile and driving restructuring measures in order to clear the path to 2025 and we continue to focus on controls to future proof the franchise which will help us reduce non-operating costs. The delivery of operational efficiencies is expected to further reduce adjusted costs over the coming quarters. Together, we are confident these measures will bring us on a path to around \u20ac20 billion of non-interest expenses in 2025, which will also support delivery of robust operating leverage. We expect credit costs to reduce towards more normalized levels in 2025, largely driven by the expected continuation of the positive development of CRE provisions and the benefits of interest rate reductions flowing through into the economy, providing us with a much cleaner slate into 2025. We remain dedicated to creating values for our shareholders and confident that with achieving our financial targets, we can also maintain our trajectory to increase distributions beyond our original goal of \u20ac8 billion in respect of the financial years 2021 to 2025. Given this continued progress, we have now thought authorization from the ECB for our next share buyback. To sum up, we remain focused on our Global Hausbank strategy and with our business momentum and all the progress made, we have clear line of sight on our target of an RoTE of greater than 10% for 2025. With that, let me hand over to James.\nJames von Moltke: Thank you Christian, and good morning. As usual, let me start with a few key performance indicators on slide eight and place them in the context of our 2025 targets. As Christian mentioned before, we are on track towards our objectives and we expect further improvements over the coming quarters. Our liquidity metrics also remain strong. Liquidity coverage ratio was 135% above our target of around 130% and the net stable funding ratio was 122%. In short, our performance in the period reaffirms our franchise strength and our confidence in reaching the 2025 targets. With that, let me turn to the third quarter highlights on slide nine. Group revenues were \u20ac7.5 billion, up 5% on the prior year quarter. Non-interest expenses were \u20ac4.7 billion, down 8%, benefitting from a partial release of the Postbank takeover litigation provision following the settlements in the third quarter. A provision of \u20ac547 million remains in place for the outstanding plaintiff claims. The settlements achieved in August and September enabled us to release around \u20ac440 million of Postbank-related provisions in the quarter which were partially offset by charges of around \u20ac90 million related to other legacy litigation items. Non-operating costs were positive \u20ac302 million in the quarter, including a net litigation release of \u20ac344 million and restructuring and severance charges of \u20ac42 million. We generated a profit before tax of \u20ac2.3 billion, up 31%, and a net profit of \u20ac1.7 billion, up 39% to the prior year quarter. Our tax rate in the quarter of 26% was impacted by the aforementioned litigation effects. In the third quarter, diluted earnings per share was \u20ac0.81 and tangible book value per share was \u20ac29.34, up 6% year-on-year. Let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results. We remain well positioned to continue delivering strong net interest income over the coming years, so let me start with a review of our NII on slide 10. NII across key banking book segments was \u20ac3.2 billion, and our trajectory continues to outperform our guidance from earlier in the year. Compared to the prior quarter, higher deposit volumes and loan margin expansion offset expected beta convergence in the Corporate Bank, although reported NII includes lower levels of CLO recoveries than in the prior quarter. Private Bank was stable sequentially, reflecting ongoing strength in deposit revenues. Our base case remains that our quarterly NII run rate will continue to be broadly stable and we reiterate that we expect full-year banking book NII to remain in line with the \u20ac13.1 billion reported in 2023, despite absorbing a headwind of around \u20ac150 million versus 2023, from the discontinuation of the minimum reserve remuneration. Our hedging strategy has positioned us well for a declining rate environment, as outlined on page 32 in the appendix. Our hedge portfolio stabilizes our income by extending the tenor of interest rate risk, but it also protects us against a drop in interest rates, and to that end we have increased the notional of our hedge portfolio over the last 12 to 18 months in response to the slower-than-expected rise in deposit betas. The weighted average maturity of our hedges is around 5 years. Based on current forward rates, we expect the income from the hedge book to grow by \u20ac300 million to \u20ac400 million each year as we roll maturing hedges. As such, we expect the hedge portfolio to provide a long-term tailwind to our revenues at current forward rates. With respect to 2025, more than 90% of the income is locked in with existing positions already. With that, let\u2019s turn to adjusted cost development, on slide 11. Adjusted costs were \u20ac5 billion for the quarter, in line with our guidance. Savings from streamlining our IT platform and lower spend for professional services were offset by higher costs for compensation and benefits, which increased by 4% year-on-year. The increase reflected wage growth as expected, higher performance-related compensation and increases in internal workforce after our targeted investments throughout 2023, partially offset by further workforce optimization. Let\u2019s now turn to provision for credit losses on slide 12. As Christian mentioned, I will elaborate on the headwinds which have persisted this year, but let\u2019s start with this quarter\u2019s provision for credit losses, which was \u20ac494 million, equivalent to 41 basis points of average loans. Stage 1 and 2 provisions were on a moderate level, as various portfolio effects largely offset increases from softer macroeconomic forecasts and overlay recalibrations in the third quarter. Stage 3 provisions increased sequentially to \u20ac482 million mainly driven by the Private Bank, including transitional Postbank integration effects. Provisions in the Corporate Bank remained stable and included the gross impact from a larger corporate restructuring event, which had already impacted the second quarter. Investment Bank provisions were slightly lower sequentially, given the anticipated and substantial improvement in Commercial Real Estate in the quarter, including a negative impact of \u20ac23 million from the expected CRE loan portfolio sale, which is underway and where we have gained pricing visibility. Let me now take you through some additional detail on our provisions on slide 13. This year, we faced several headwinds, which negatively impacted provisions and our full-year guidance, but which we do not expect to persist into 2025 at all, or in the same magnitude depending on the item. First, the transitional effects from the Postbank integration led to longer-than-expected impacts across our internal collection and recovery processes, but we expect these to fade over the coming quarters. Second, we have been dealing with two relatively fast-paced larger corporate events, impacting year-to-date provisions at a level unusual compared to historical standards. However, the pre-tax impact was mitigated by around 70%, as these loans benefitted from credit-concentration hedging. And lastly, our full-year CRE provision run rate has been at a cyclically higher level, but has now substantially declined quarter on quarter, as envisaged. We continue to see more signs of stabilization, which supports our confidence in a gradual reduction in future provisions. In general, we maintain tight underwriting standards and continue to conservatively manage our loan book which includes managing single-name concentration risks through comprehensive hedging programs, including our recently issued Significant Risk Transfer transactions, which bring the total notional volume of hedges to \u20ac41 billion. Our regular and comprehensive portfolio reviews, including close assessment of trends at the sub-segment level and deeper dives into more vulnerable sectors, show that overall credit quality remains stable; forward-looking indicators such as rating migration and trends in our non-investment grade portfolio and watchlist ratios do not suggest a noteworthy deterioration in asset quality. We also see broadly stable developments in our domestic market, as outlined on page 38 of the appendix. Our \u20ac220 billion German loan book is low risk and well diversified across businesses, and 70% of the portfolio is either collateralized or supported by financial guarantees. We also have more than \u20ac12 billion in hedges. More than three quarters of the book is in the Private Bank, of which around 90% consists of low-risk German retail mortgages. Our corporate loan book is well diversified and of high quality. Exposure is predominantly to multi-national corporates and MidCaps, with almost 70% of loans rated investment grade. Importantly, early warning indicators in Germany remain robust; the number of limits subject to our watchlist remains largely unchanged since the end of last year and we do not observe any significant, broad-based rating deterioration across the portfolio. In summary, our portfolio is holding up well and adjusting our reported gross provisions for offsetting effects from recoveries through hedging, which are captured as revenues, our pro-forma year-to-date net provisions would have been around 34 basis points. We continue to expect a sequential reduction in provisions, towards more normalized levels as we go into 2025. Before we move to performance in our businesses, let me turn to capital on slide 14. Our third-quarter Common Equity Tier 1 ratio came in at 13.8%, 30 basis points higher compared to the previous quarter. The increase was largely driven by CET1 capital, reflecting strong earnings net of deductions, and an approximately \u20ac790 million or 22-basis-point positive effect from the adoption of the Article 468 CRR transitional rule for unrealized gains and losses. Risk-weighted assets increased for market risk and credit risk. The credit risk RWA increase was driven by model impacts and business growth, mostly offset by reductions from capital efficiency measures. Lower operational risk RWA were driven by the partial release of the Postbank takeover litigation provision. At the end of the third quarter our leverage ratio was 4.6%, flat sequentially, as higher leverage exposure driven by securities financing transactions and trading assets offset an increase in Tier 1 capital in line with the CET1 capital development. With that, let\u2019s now turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on slide 16. Corporate Bank revenues in the third quarter were \u20ac1.8 billion essentially flat year-on-year, as normalization of deposit margins was mostly offset by higher deposit volumes, growth in commissions and fee income, and increased loan NII. The 5% increase in commissions and fee income in the first nine months reflects the impact of our growth initiatives and shows good progress to offset the normalization of deposit revenues. In the third quarter, commissions and fee income was 4% higher year-on-year, reflecting growth in our Institutional Client Services business, and essentially flat compared to the seasonally strong second quarter. Deposits increased by \u20ac7 billion in the quarter and are \u20ac23 billion higher year-on-year driven by higher term and sight deposits across currencies. This growth was partially driven by certain client accommodation activities, which we expect to normalize in the fourth quarter. Provision for credit losses was at \u20ac126 million, in line with the previous quarter, and increased significantly year-on-year driven by higher stage 3 provisions and the non-recurrence of a one-off model change in stage 1 and 2 in the prior year. Higher stage 3 provisions included a larger corporate restructuring event, which had already impacted the second quarter and was partially covered by risk mitigation measures. Non-interest expenses were slightly higher year-on-year driven by front office investments and higher internal service cost allocations. This resulted in a post-tax return on tangible equity of 13.1% and a cost/income ratio of 64%. I\u2019ll now turn to the Investment Bank on slide 17. Revenues for the third quarter were 11% higher year-on-year on a reported basis, driven by improvements across both FIC and O&A. Revenues in Fixed Income & Currencies also increased by 11%, driven by significantly higher Credit Trading and Emerging Markets revenues and supported by stable performance in Financing Credit Trading showed strength in the Distressed business and continued performance in Flow, reflecting investments made into the franchise. Emerging Markets demonstrated year-on-year growth across regions. Foreign Exchange revenues were higher, with continued strength in Spot, while revenues in Rates were lower in a market environment that continues to be uncertain. Moving to O&A, revenues were significantly higher than in the prior year, with increases across business lines reflecting a growing industry fee pool. Debt Origination revenues were higher, driven by increased industry activity across Investment Grade and Leveraged Debt. Advisory revenues were strong and materially higher year-on-year, with the business benefitting from prior period investments. Non-interest expenses and adjusted costs were both essentially flat year-on-year, with the impact of strategic investments offset by lower infrastructure allocations. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac135 million, or 52 basis points of average loans. The previous year quarter materially benefitted from a provision release from model changes. Turning to the Private Bank on slide 18. Revenues in the quarter were \u20ac2.3 billion, essentially flat, with non-interest revenue growth of 7% year-on-year. The decline in NII was driven by continued higher funding costs from the impact of minimum reserves, the Group-neutral impact of certain hedging costs as well as a negative episodic effect from our lending books, mainly in Personal Banking. Excluding these effects, third-quarter revenues in the Private Bank would have been up 4% year-on-year. Personal Banking continues to record higher deposit revenues in Germany which were more than offset by the aforementioned impacts weighing on the net interest income. Wealth Management & Private Banking grew revenues by 5% to \u20ac1 billion, driven by higher lending and investment revenues, partially offset by lower deposit revenues. We continue to see good business momentum with net inflows into assets under management of \u20ac8 billion in the quarter mainly in Wealth Management & Private Banking. The Private Bank continues the transformation of the Personal Banking business in Germany with around 50 branch closures and further workforce reductions in the first nine months of the year. Savings have been offset this quarter by higher infrastructure cost allocations and higher compensation expenses, including wage inflation, as well as continued residual expenses for service remediation. As announced in the fourth quarter of 2022, the refinement of our methodology to allocate infrastructure costs resulted in Group-neutral year-on-year expense shifts between the businesses, noticeable this quarter in the Private Bank; however, even including the allocations, adjusted costs were down 2% in the first nine months, compared to the prior year period. Looking ahead, we foresee the Private Bank to resume the cost reduction path next quarter with residual costs for service remediation to continue to taper and further benefits from ongoing transformation, including from the integration of the IT platform and further branch closures. As I outlined earlier, credit quality of our domestic and international portfolios remains high. Loan loss provisions this quarter still included \u20ac40 million of transitional Postbank integration effects which should cease. Let me continue with Asset Management on slide 19. My usual reminder: the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Profit before tax improved by 54% from the prior year period, reflecting operating leverage from higher revenues and stable noninterest expenses. Revenues increased by 11%, driven by management fees of \u20ac626 million. This growth from both Active and Passive products reflected increasing average assets under management from market development and net inflows. Performance and transaction fees were significantly lower driven by the impact of real estate valuations and lower transaction volumes in Alternatives. Non-interest expenses were 1% lower, while adjusted costs were essentially flat compared to the prior year. Lower non-compensation costs, particularly in IT, offset slightly higher compensation and benefits costs. Assets under management increased by \u20ac30 billion to \u20ac963 billion resulting in record-high assets under management levels. The increase was attributable to positive market appreciation and net inflows. The positive net inflow trend for Passive continues, with a further \u20ac10 billion gathered in the quarter, resulting in over \u20ac27 billion of net inflows year-to-date. Active Fixed Income contributed with net inflows of \u20ac10 billion in the quarter, more than offsetting net outflows in Active Equity, Multi-Asset and Alternatives products. The cost/income ratio for the quarter declined to 67% and return on tangible equity was 18.9%, both improving from the third quarter last year. Moving to Corporate & Other on slide 20. - Corporate & Other reported a pre-tax profit of \u20ac424 million compared to a pre-tax loss of \u20ac202 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by a provision release in the Postbank takeover litigation matter of around \u20ac440 million. Revenues were positive \u20ac157 million; this compares to positive \u20ac35 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by valuation and timing differences, which were positive \u20ac295 million, reflecting partial reversion of prior period losses and impacts from market moves. The pre-tax losses associated with legacy portfolios were \u20ac142 million driven primarily by provisions for legacy litigation items. At the end of the quarter, risk-weighted assets stood at \u20ac34 billion, including \u20ac13 billion of operational risk RWA. In aggregate, RWAs have reduced by \u20ac8 billion year-on-year, mainly reflecting a change in the allocation of operational risk RWA. Leverage exposure was \u20ac36 billion at the end of the quarter, slightly lower than the prior year quarter. Finally, let me turn to the Group outlook on slide 21. Our ongoing performance demonstrates the successful execution of our strategy. Our revenue trajectory remains on track to \u20ac30 billion for this year, on the path to our goal for \u20ac32 billion in 2025. Looking at the fourth quarter and starting with the Corporate Bank, we expect revenues to remain essentially flat sequentially, as growth in non-interest revenues compensates for lower deposit income. In the Investment Bank, we expect a strong performance across our businesses in FIC, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. We are encouraged by our fourth-quarter pipeline in Origination & Advisory, which is higher year-on-year and suggests positive momentum for the remainder of 2024, both sequentially and year-on-year. The Private Bank is expected to grow revenues sequentially driven by higher NII. Finally, we expect Asset Management to grow revenues as the momentum of the last six months carries over and further accelerates into the fourth quarter, with potential upside from performance fees. We expect to further reduce our adjusted cost run rate closer to \u20ac4.9 billion in the coming quarters to allow us to achieve around \u20ac20 billion of non-interest expenses in 2025. The reduction should come through a combination of ongoing cost discipline and benefits from our efficiency and tactical measures. We expect reported provision for credit losses for 2024 to land at around \u20ac1.8 billion, higher than our prior guidance, but we continue to expect an amelioration will follow next year, as the transitory headwinds we called out will pass, leading to a reduction towards more normalized levels. Our robust operating performance in the third quarter, including the ongoing work in putting legacy items behind us, helps us lay the foundation for delivery in 2025. Furthermore, our strong capital position gives us a good step off for our 2025 and 2026 distribution objectives. And as Christian said, our full focus remains on the execution of our own strategy. With that, let me hand back to Ioana, and we look forward to your questions.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you James. Operator, we are now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for the first question please. And the first question comes from Anke Reingen from RBC. Please go ahead.\nAnke Reingen: Yes, thank you very much for taking my questions. The first is on loan losses. When we talk about 2025 and towards more normalized level, is that closer to 30 basis points? And then what should give us the confidence that the loan losses can come down in Q4 and 2025? I mean you show us slide 13 should the Postbank integration and the large corporate events almost drop out or drop out in 2025? And when you gave us 24 guidance and we've been looking, sorry to say, about two quarters of upward revision. So what did you underestimate when you previously guided for 2024. And then second on the buybacks. Yes, great to hear you applied for approval. But can you be more specific on the amount should we use the slide 24 where you talk about the 50% increase year-over-year as a potential indicator of your request at this time? And what does it mean for potential additional buybacks in calendar year 2025? When do you think you can make a decision and is that a function of the loan loss charge guidance as well? And maybe that\u2019s an opportunity to say something about the still outstanding settlements post the Postbank ruling today. Thank you very much.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you. Anke, it's Christian. Let me start. And as usual, James will add obviously to all your questions. Let me start with the share buybacks because that also goes into the direction of, so to say, the most recent ruling of the Cologne court. First of all with the share buyback. As we always said after the full provisioning of the Postbank litigation case in April, we always said, we want to show to you two clean quarters, Q2, Q3 which we did. And even without the release which we recorded in the third quarter for Postbank, we have shown a record quarter for Deutsche bank in the third quarter. And that gave us then obviously the conviction and the clear path now to apply for a share buyback. By the way, I think with the 13.8 core tier one, this is also a nice step which gives us the confidence for the application. With regard to amounts and timing, we always do it like in the past. We obviously keep that discussion with our regulator. But I can tell you that there is full confidence with James and myself and the management team that based on the step off of 30.8%, based on the trajectory of our operating results, we are convinced of our distribution of above 8 billion for the time zone between 21 and 25. So nothing changed. Also, what I would like to emphasize is actually that today's ruling you have just seen that is not actually affecting our share buyback because we provisioned that amount in full and also in our capital plan going forward we did actually not assume further releases in our capital plan. So in this regard of course we don't like the ruling and now we have to analyze it and think about potential next steps. But for the capital plan going forward and for the share buyback this is no impact because we are fully provisioned. And in this regard we remain convinced and confident that we can deliver above the 8 billion. For us it was important to show two good quarters and solid quarters in terms of operating performance. And I think we see that from a revenue point of view, from a cost point of view and hence with the underlying result. Let me briefly go over to the loan loss provision question because I understand that that obviously raises some questions on your side. Look, I really think it's important that we look into the composition of the loan loss provision and what really drove the number to 494 million this quarter. And yes, we said that we see in the second half of 2024, a decreasing trend. Let me explain why this did not happen. Number one, I know you, you are looking with concerns to Germany and the commercial real estate with regards to both items. To be honest, I see robust portfolio quality. In particular, if I look at the corporate side and the private banking side and the underlying loan loss provisions in Germany, we don't see any material change. We don't see any material change in the portfolio composition. If you look at indicators like up versus downgrades, if you look like additions to watch lists, this is not a concerning trend. Now, what increased in the private bank is still the result of the backlog in the Postbank operations that actually we thought that this comes earlier down. It will come down. We even will see some bookings. That is, in terms of that, we will see releases of certain reserves in 2025. So the trend is coming down and we will see releases. But we hoped actually for a faster reduction in this regard during the year 2024. So that is one item. The second item, I think, which is underlying positive is on the commercial real estate. If you actually look at the underlying portfolio composition, the trend is coming down. It's for the first time that commercial real estate provisions have come down sequentially, quarter-over-quarter. And it would have come even more down if we wouldn't have done a portfolio sale where we got the first mark and where actually we booked an additional provision from the portfolio sale in the low double digit number, that is obviously capital accretive. But overall, the commercial real estate provisions are coming down, and that is, again, something which we forecasted at the start of the year. But to be honest, we thought that this is already happening in Q2, now it is coming in, in Q3. Now, if I take all these items, and the third item, sorry, I should have said that is one larger loan loss provision in the south of Germany for a corporate name which is, though significantly hedged. So if you see the net loss position which we have from that, it is obviously far less than the gross loan loss provision which we have booked in Q3 that was also, by the way, a name where we already booked the first loan provision in Q2. So if you take these three items, the Postbank item, which will come down, and we even see reversals of bookings in 2025, if you see the underlying rate in the commercial real estate, and on top of that, if you look at the one name where we had gross loan provisions, but which was significantly hedged, actually, we see also with regard to 2025, and that was that what James was referring to in his prepared remarks, a normalized run rate for loan loss provisions of \u20ac350 million. And that is actually where we see, based on the portfolio quality, we have the trend going. And in this regard, I do think that we have seen now in this quarter, the peak of the loan loss provisions, with that number coming down to approximately 350 million per quarter in the 2025 year.\nAnke Reingen: Thank you. Can you come back on the capital, on the buyback? So should we look at the 50% increase, and is the plan still to potentially top up in the course of 2025? Thank you.\nChristian Sewing: So, Anke, you referred to page 24 in the appendix, and yes, that lays out the path that we broadly wish to follow to deliver on the promises we've made. As I said, the 8 billion to us is a number that we think we're confident will exceed. We're not going to go into precise euro numbers at this point, but I think 24 lays out a good path. As it relates to incremental buybacks next year it's very early to make that determination. As we've talked about, there are lots of moving parts in a capital plan. Under the best of circumstances, next year we'll have CRR3 coming due in two phases, changes in the environment, potential upside in areas like, for example, the sectoral buffer that's been applied in Germany to mortgages. So lots of moving parts that at this point, one doesn't want to get ahead of. So we'll make that decision much later in 25 than today's application.\nAnke Reingen: Okay, thank you very much. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Flora Bocahut from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nFlora Bocahut: Yes, thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have one on NII and one on cost, please. So on the NII, could we come back, please, to the drop? We saw this quarter in the corporate bank. It's led the banking book and AI to be just 3.2 billion this quarter. And I think the full year guidance you have implies it would be, again, about that level in Q4. I mean, when I look at the slide, 32 and it's useful. Thank you very much for putting in that slide. I see you blocked a significant part of the hedge income already for the next two years, so that's very reassuring. I also see that you've used a ten year swap that would be 2.3 to 2.5%. That makes sense based on today's curve. But, the risk here is rather to the downside. So the question here is also, the light blue column, the contribution from the rollover of the hedges. If, you know, the ten year swap would go towards, say, 2% or 2.2%, would we still see, the rollover, contribute positively in the next two years, despite, on top of what you've locked already? So that's for NII. And then the second question is on cost. I think you were saying before, James, that to make your guidance for 2025 cost, you would need to get adjusted cost quarterly run rate down towards \u20ac4.9 billion. Obviously, you just had three quarters in a row where you've met the guidance for this year at \u20ac5.0 billion. So maybe could you talk a little bit into the capacity for you to get there already in Q4? And what gives you the confidence that you can get to \u20ac4.9 billion quarterly run rate for adjusted cost next year? Thank you.\nJames von Moltke: Thank you, Flora. Happy to answer those questions. So, on the NII disclosure that we provide, you're right, there's, of course, some risk on the rollover of the hedges. We like that. We've locked in 90% for next year. And, yes, we use the implied forward curve to look at what the future might be. The dark blue is as I say what's locked in for the next several years. Remember, of course, that the gap is against hedges that are rolling off, that were essentially at zero or very, very low. So the idea that there may be a little bit of downside in the light blue bars, that's true. But the quantum is against very low hedges put in many years ago, as much as ten years ago in that rollover. And that actually goes to the first part of your question, which is the corporate bank. Yes, we had in the series sort of a low point in the corporate bank, but actually there are some hedges that now roll off in the fourth quarter into chunks, and that gives us some good visibility into the trajectory for the corporate bank. If I think about the two businesses separately, we are -- we think we may have passed the low point in the trajectory for private bank already now in Q3, and we'll be passing that low point in Q4 for the corporate bank. It's obviously early to make that judgment and we'll see how everything plays out, including the balance sheet growth, deposit growth betas and what have you. But we think we're on a path now to be rising in 2025, not just because of the benefit of the long-term hedges. So it's overall quite encouraging pictures as we see it. Going to costs. Yes, absolutely. We're focused sort of every day on managing the run rate down, and I think we've said in the past towards \u20ac4.9 billion that remains our objective here. The trajectory in the first three quarters of this year has been encouraging. And even in the third quarter, I can point to some things that are, that are of a non-recurring nature in the third quarter, I think so. I think we're close to or at the \u20ac5 billion level, but we need to continue working it down from this point. And that is the full focus of the firm. We have the projects and the initiatives in place to do that. So for us, it's just about additional delivery of our operational efficiency program. We've talked about it in the past. It's optimization initiatives in Germany. We've announced some more actions on the distribution network in Germany. We've been investing in technology and we're having harvesting some of the benefits of that. I think we have a very successful track record now on workforce optimization, because what you see in the overall headcount, as well as the compensation and benefits line, is the impact of reductions in force that we've implemented reinvestments both in the front office in technology and controls, all of which we've managed within the run rate and we think we've got a whole raft of initiatives of a strategic nature underway to deliver further on those run rate improvements as well as tactical steps that we've been taking throughout the year and will continue to take to ensure we deliver on the objectives. Hope that all helps, Flora.\nFlora Bocahut: Yes, that's very clear. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKian Abouhossein: I got two questions. One is relating more specifically a question on the Article 468, the CRR3. Using these transitional rules, I'm just trying to understand the dynamic on the OCI. It's about 20 basis points on your capital and why are you using it? Because it is transitional, so at one point, you will have to take the impact. So just to understand, first of all, the dynamic, but also your decision process or why you've taken the benefit. And then second question is related to your 2025 revenues, you need to grow revenues just under 7% from \u20ac30 billion to \u20ac32 billion, even if you adjust for the \u20ac300 million delta on your hedges, clearly it's quite an upward sloping curve in terms of revenue growth in a more difficult German environment. And maybe you could just outline a bit how we should think about your assumptions in a more difficult German environment, and I'm not sure what your German environment outlook is in 2025 in terms of reaching that \u20ac32 billion, especially, again, Corporate Bank 2025 and then Private Bank in 2025.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, Kian. Let me start with the revenues and James is then going to your capital question. Look, first of all, before we talk about 2025 and fully understood your question, I think it's very encouraging that we have full sight on the \u20ac30 billion for 2024. And again, I think we have established a track record in achieving our revenue guidance for the last years. And if I look actually where we stand at the end of the third quarter, how actually October started in particular on the trading side. You just heard James talking about sort of say, a potential low point in the NII in the Private Bank, then also where equity indices are and what that potentially means for performance fees and asset management, we are super confident that we can achieve the \u20ac30 billion, which is obviously the right jump-off your question regarding the \u20ac32 billion. Now when we come to the \u20ac32 billion, look, the first item is, again, a continuation of that for James outlined on the NII side because everything what we can see from our forecast, given our hedging profile, but also, in particular, looking at our deposit growth, which we see in the Corporate Bank, but also in the Private Bank, we do feel that actually, just from an NII across the bank and in particular, carried by the Corporate Bank and by the Private Bank, we do see an upside of approximately \u20ac300 million to \u20ac400 million on the NII side. By the way, Kian, that does not include the expected growth on the financing volume, in particular also in [Indiscernible] business in the Investment Bank. So that when I look at the forecast, just from the financing part in that area and the NII part, obviously, my starting position is then \u20ac500 million up, i.e., \u20ac30.5 million. And now let's go through the businesses and, in particular, look at the investments which we have done over the last 18 months to move the businesses, in particular in the non-NII area. There's, of course, the Investment Bank, and there the O&A business. You have seen with the last quarters that we clearly outperformed the market. We have grown market share. Actually, not everybody, so to say, which we hired over the last 18 months is yet obviously running at full speed. So this is still to come. So we actually expect in the O&A business further market share gains, and we also expect actually that 2025, with all indications we have from our from our mandates, which we see for Q4 and Q1 already, this will be a year with actually higher fees for the banks. And that means if you have a higher market share, which we already increased by 60 or 70 basis points, which we will obviously benefit. So we do believe that, just in the O&A business, we see upside of another \u20ac500 million towards the number which we are printing for the year 2024. Then we have invested and you have also seen over the last years actually to compliment here, Ram Nayak, we have seen constant increases in market share in the FIC business. I think we have done a terrific job over there. Now if you follow Ram's planning going forward, obviously, we have an eye in certain areas, so to say, business areas like credit. But also from a regional point of view, we invested quite significantly over the last 9 months into our U.S. franchise. So I would say, with the market shares, which we definitely also won again in Q3 with the investments we have done in that business, there is also further increases to come from the FIC business in the Investment Bank. Then let's turn to the private bank. So I talked about the NII profile. But obviously, the biggest lever, which we see in the Private Bank. And there, we see actually already a good momentum on the wealth management side. But if you look at the assets under management, which are increasing steadily, I think we are year-to-date in the private bank, approximately \u20ac27 billion or \u20ac29 billion assets under management. We will obviously benefit from that NIC [ph] to the NII I described before, similar, by the way, on the assets under management in Asset Management in Stefan's book. So that I also clearly expect a 3-digit million increase in revenues in asset management next year. And that leaves me with the Corporate Bank. I think the Corporate Bank in itself is a success story. This is, in the meantime, so to say, at the heart of the bank. Quarter-by-quarter, we are increasing the mandates we get from our corporate clients around the world. There is clearly, clearly, the trend of the corporates around the world to go for at least one alternative to the U.S. banks. They would like to have the European alternative. With the network we have and the investments we have done in our platform, payment platform business, as well into our digital offerings, we can see further increases in the fee business there. So all-in-all, starting actually at \u20ac30.5 billion with the hedging profile on the NII side, and looking at the track record, I'm very confident that the \u20ac32 billion is a number which we can achieve. And last but not least, if I really think about 2025, if you think about the walk and the normalized costs we have on the loan loss provision, clearly reduced costs on the legal side. James was just talking about all our efforts and also progress we are doing on the operating cost side. And we will have less restructuring costs. To be honest, Kian, but you know me personally, we don't even need \u20ac32 billion of revenues in order to go to the 10%. But that doesn't mean that I'm trying to put a soft touch on the \u20ac32 billion. I think you have heard my absolute conviction that \u20ac32 billion is definitely achievable.\nJames Von Moltke: And Kian, just to touch your OCI filter, the CRR3 rule that we're taking advantage of. I think the short answer is, because it's there. The time value of capital in our ratio, especially as we're often measured against a distance to MDA appears, to us to be valuable and hence, the decision to take advantage of that transitional arrangement. Remember that the 22 basis points could be a lower number when the time comes that the transition benefit is over. So the passage of time and the book of securities that are generating those unrealized losses, we'll see some attrition and then the interest environmental change. So it's a number that may be considerably lower than 20 basis points when that transition period ends. And therefore, we think it's valuable for our shareholders to be able to redeploy that capital during that 18-month period.\nKian Abouhossein: Very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Chris Hallam from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChris Hallam: Yes, morning everybody. Just two for me. So first, on M&A. Does the current M&A situation in Germany impact at all how you think about your banking strategy in the home market, the competitive landscape in Germany or how you would prioritize organic versus inorganic growth? And then the second in O&A, it looks like you lost some share in the quarter. Your share was trending up 70 basis points in the first half, and now I think you're calling it up 50 bps versus 2023. So just what are the moving parts there, is that just mix? And does that change at all how you think about the composition of O&A revenues into next year, obviously, notwithstanding the answer you just gave to Kian?\nChristian Sewing: Thank you Chris. Let me take the first one and James just taking the second one. Look, on the M&A side and on the specific potential situation you're referring to in Germany, that doesn't change our strategy at all. I think we have a very solid and a very good footprint in Germany, both in the Private Bank as well as in the Corporate Bank. We have worked on, obviously, on two sites in Germany to make that even more attractive. A, you see all the work just done by Claudio, in particular, in the Retail Bank to make this business more efficient. We know that there is work to be done, but I can see how Claudio you is actually focusing on that to have an efficient platform to offer digitalized products to our retail clients. And honestly, quarter-by-quarter, also with the feedback we get from the clients, we see clear improvement. On the Corporate Side, I think, again, what I said before, it was the right decision to establish ourselves with an own Corporate Bank and to make sure that we are, sort of say, the bank for German Mittelstand family-owned clients and obviously the large clients to support them domestically, but in particular, when they go abroad. And in this regard, we feel that we are rightly positioned. And with all the efficiency programs, we can actually see that the profitability in the German business on both sides is further increasing and will further increase. Now whenever it comes to these kind of potential items, to be honest, Chris, we shouldn't underestimate the opportunities for us. Because at the end of the day, it creates uncertainty, it creates uncertainty, so to say, with the other institutions, but in particular also with the clients. And we are ready to act. And this is what we established over the last three years to four years, both in the Corporate Bank and in the Private Bank. And in this regard, we have a clear strategy that is delivery of 20%, 25%, 10% and in this regard, whenever there is an opportunity to gain market share domestically, we will do this.\nJames Von Moltke: And Chris, your question about O&A market share, you're correct that Q3 was a little lower than the year-to-date. And that was mostly mix, particularly the leveraged debt capital markets was a smaller part of the wallet in Q3. We're actually encouraged by continued sort of year-on-year improvement in our M&A market share, where some of the investments are beginning to bear fruit. And that's particularly on an announced basis rather than a booked basis. If I look to the -- what we would estimate the market share to be in the fourth quarter based on the forward look of our pipeline and estimates of next quarter, we think we'll be back in the kind of 2.5, 2.6 range where we've been this year, and that's an encouraging step-up into next year.\nChris Hallam: Okay, thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Giulia Aurora Miotto from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nGiulia Miotto: Yes hi good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two both very longer dated. So the first one is on the Postbank integration. If we take a step back, why is this still a topic? I mean by now, I would have expected the bank to be fully integrated, the IT to be merged. So when can we essentially stop talking about this and really see a step change in the cost on the Private Bank? And then my second question is on Private Credit, and this is becoming incrementally a topic. U.S. investment banks were talking a lot about this in Q3 results. And how do you approach Private Credit? Do you see it as a potential disruptor to some of your lending business? Do you see it as an opportunity to grow fee businesses by partnering? Yes, any comments on the Private Credit side? Thank you.\nJames Von Moltke: Sure, Giulia, it's James. I'll take the both, and Christian, I want to add on the private credit side. Look, Postbank, the recovery from the operational disruptions that took place in last year's third quarter has taken us longer than we expected. Among other things, we were extremely focused on ensuring that we close out the backlogs of processes that were adversely affecting our clients. That was our focus. It was also the BaFin focus as they looked at the problem set. Hence, collections was an area that we waited longer to focus on improving. We've now made those investments, and we've hired the people, we've trained the people and that collections process is getting closer to normal. That took us longer than we expected this year, no question, which is why it's had the impact on the CLP guidance that it did. But given where we are right now and being up and running on that process, I think we feel much more comfortable that we're at the end rather than that there's still risk. The other thing is a little bit in the details, but the last model conversion of a portfolio from Postbank onto the DB systems and models on the risk side, that took place in the third quarter, that also influenced that number of \u20ac40 million. So why is it a topic? The sort of longer-term impact of the operational disruptions that is coming to an end as well as the models. On Private Credit, we see it more as an opportunity than as a threat. Obviously, there's a degree to which the banks face the risk of disintermediation. But I think that is -- that downside is more than offset by the upside of, frankly, a growing market, a growing ability to place risk in the marketplace and thereby increase our origination sort of business model, fees on origination and expand loan origination beyond what the capital on our balance sheet supports by itself. We also see opportunities sort of in collaboration with private credit firms to do more, collaboration with our own asset manager, DWS, to do more as DWS builds its strategies in Private Credit. So we aim to be here a participant not just as an originator, but also as a partner and a participant in managing private credit. So it is a change in the market. It is a disruption to some extent, but one that we're strategically we, at Deutsche Bank, feel we're actually well positioned on a relative basis globally and particularly in Europe, to be a beneficiary.\nGiulia Miotto: Thank you. Can I just check on Postbank. So now the IT system is fully integrated, you have just one? Or are you still running more than one?\nJames Von Moltke: No, at this point, everything has moved over, and the remaining work is really archiving and what have you, one system. Interestingly, there's some future opportunities. There's actually one of the cost benefits that we see and revenue benefits going forward, Postbank has actually jumped out ahead of Deutsche Bank in some of its digital properties. And the investments we're making this year going into next year would actually help us catch up and accelerate further the Deutsche Bank side of that equation. So in a sense, there is more opportunity to be serving customers in a leading way competitively in this marketplace in both brands now that we have the hard work behind us. And by the way, most of the synergy value captured a little bit more still to come in Q4 and Q1.\nGiulia Miotto: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Stefan Stalmann from Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nStefan Stalmann: Hi, good morning. Gentlemen, thank you very much for taking my questions. I wanted to ask, please, you're mentioning that you're clearing the path for 2025 targets, acting decisively to address legacy items. Does it hint at any elevated one-offs potentially coming in the fourth quarter, let's say, on restructuring expenses? The second question I wanted to ask is on this upcoming portfolio sale in U.S. commercial real estate. Can you give us a rough sense of what the notion of that portfolio is in how Stage 3 loans, please? And if I may, just a quick third question. You mentioned these credit concentration hedges and the benefits from them. Could you let us know in which P&L items, which revenue items and which divisions we would find these hedge benefits, please, and how large they are? Thank you.\nJames Von Moltke: Stefan, thanks for the questions. I'll take all three. Again, Christian, you may want to add. I'd say it's too early to tell on your question of is there anything sort of extraordinary that we may book in Q4. And the reason for that is in -- when I think about litigation, for example, what's in our control and not either analytically or in actual settlement activity is always hard to tell. But certainly, and I think we've been consistent in messaging on this, we want to put ourselves in a place where we no longer have surprises like the Postbank takeover litigation item for shareholders. Equally, we're in the planning process, restructuring and severance, we're still working towards our \u20ac400 million budget for the year, you'll see -- you've seen that Q4 -- actually, we did less than we expected in Q3, I'm sorry. And so there may be a bit of a catch-up in Q4. If there are additional tactical measures that we identify, we may go a little bit further there. Another area I might point out is real estate, we're always looking at our real estate portfolio and to see where we can optimize further. In all of those areas, too early to say what actions we could find to take place. But I think it's a signal of a company always looking for ways to optimize, improve our run rates and then deliver on promises -- in a sustainable way, by the way, deliver our promises for next year. On the CRE portfolio, it was approaching but not quite \u20ac1 billion that we put in the market. Of that, a little bit is sort of approaching 40% with Stage 3, and then the rest, a mix of performing in Stage 2. We were encouraged, frankly, by the pricing that we saw. Remember that when you're doing a portfolio sale, does it the \u20ac23 million we book, is it telling us our marks weren't right or simply that we're placing somebody else's cost of capital for our own? I think more of the latter. And given how close the marks on the Stage 3 are to on the Stage 3 elements are to our bookings, we see that as encouraging and further evidence of our view that the commercial real estate is at least found a floor and is stabilizing. That transaction, incidentally, I hope we were clear, but we have not closed on that transaction, but we have now booked to where we think it leads us in terms of marks. So that's overall encouraging. On the hedges, it's in both CB and IB, and a couple of those exposures they were shared across the two. We call them sort of concentration hedges. Well, we have a programmatic sort of policy to ensure that our concentrations don't exceed certain levels. When they do in terms of the underwriting, we sell those exposures away into typically CLO structures, sometimes other structures. The accounting has an asymmetry and produces revenue. Actually, net interest income was smaller this quarter, a little bit more in the first half. In total, over the course of the year, that's amounted to about \u20ac200 million. So only 30% of the losses actually sort of went to capital given the benefit of the hedging. I think it's a sign of the prudence that goes into that programmatic hedging that we do. And actually, going back to Giulia's question, it's an area where the growth of Private Credit is obviously helpful, because we see improvements both in capacity and pricing in the market into which we sell away the risk that we're talking about. I hope that all helps, Stefan.\nStefan Stalmann: Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from M. Clark from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Clark: Hi, actually, it's a similar question on the hedges. So there's a commentary of group mutual hedge in Private Banking revenues as a drag this quarter. So I'm just wondering where within the group is the offsetting benefit there. Thank you. Both in terms of division.\nJames Von Moltke: Thank you. It's in treasury was where -- or Corporate & Other, where the offset last year was. So what we did was there was some what I think of as hedging of the convexity of the mortgage portfolio, which we historically had kept in treasury. This year, the decision was to push that out to the business where we think it appropriately belongs. And where -- by the way, one of the reasons to do that was the hedge programs that we're able to implement have improved. So that was the trigger for the change. And so that's meant that Private Bank on the surface has had a year-on-year comparison that's worse, both on revenues, by the way, and on costs than the -- I'll use the word, underlying performance would show. So it's been a noisy quarter for PB, but in areas that at least two of which are group neutral, either on the cost side with other segments or, in this case, on the revenue side with Corporate & Other.\nMatthew Clark: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeremy Sigee from BNP Paribas Exane. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Sigee: Hi, there, thank you. A couple of follow-ups. A lot has also been talked about. Firstly, on the U.S. CRE. I just wanted to check something that I think you implied, but your -- on Slide 37, you've shown the quarterly CLPs have now stepped back down to sort of \u20ac68 million. I think you're implying that that's the new run rate. We stay around that level going forward. I just wanted to make sure that I'm sort of understanding that right. And I guess it's a positive really that your modified loans are now \u20ac13 billion out of the \u20ac15 billion. So it sort of implies you work your way through the -- pretty much the whole portfolio, and I guess that supports that outlook. So first question is really just are we now expecting to go forward at that 68-ish run rate? And then the second question, I just wanted to press you a bit more on the M&A topic. You were commenting this morning on the Newswire, James, about Deutsche Bank positioned to play a leading role in European consolidation. The industrial logic makes sense, but you're just not ready right now. And I just wondered sort of how you view the scenario of someone like Commerzbank tying up with a different bank and effectively becoming unavailable, what remaining optionality would you have? Where else would you see opportunities for consolidation and for Deutsche Bank to play a leading role?\nJames Von Moltke: So Jeremy, thanks for the questions. So more or less the answer is yes. We -- if we had printed in Q2 what we did in Q3, I think we would have been congratulated for the foresight. But we are absolutely seeing a trend here, and it's based on the items that we've talked about for a while. So relative stability in valuations, which you see in the loan to value. The interest rate environment. Obviously, the external indices that you've seen. And now having tested the market with the loan sale, also the results of that market check. As you also alluded to, inside the \u20ac68 million is \u20ac23 million that is -- and you could also think of it as bringing forward. And so the underlying run rate was even better. Look, I don't want to promise a number, I think having leaned out a little bit far in Q1 about Q2. But the direction of travel is there and all of the drivers that I referred to are there and visible. And as it relates to the modifications, you're correct. I mean, look, some of this portfolio will have been modified and then have its new maturity and come up for an extension a second time. So it's not impossible that it grows beyond the 15%, but it is -- just as a metric. But it is the case that we've been through the lion's share of the maturity profile and potential for modification. As we said last quarter, the list of projects where we see kind of scope for new defaults is obviously declining. So the number of loans where we see a risk in -- that there are modifications or default for the next 12 months, declining significantly. So all of those things to us are encouraging. Given you referred to my comments, I'll go quickly and Christian may want to add. I think our language on the strategic environment in Europe has been consistent throughout Deutsche Bank. I don't think it's a God-given right, but given the business that we do, our size, our home market and our sort of global capabilities, we think we are well positioned to be -- to play a leading role in time. We've also been consistently clear that we didn't see that time as having come. And that remains the case today. We've been consistent in our messaging that as we look to 2025, executing on our strategies delivering profitability, demonstrating its sustainability, demonstrating the growth, we'll do more for our shareholders considerably than anything that's inorganic. And so I think we -- I want to just emphasize the consistency of our language, but also over time, the ambitions we have for the organization, but it's all over time. One last note to just make -- to your question, our opportunity set changes, no question. If, in fact, the combination that is muted does take place. But it's one of a number of opportunities that one could consider. I don't want to be drawn on what those look like or when, but as you can imagine, we've given thought to the question you posed over the years.\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Tom Hallett from KBW. Please go ahead.\nThomas Hallett: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, when I look to fourth quarter guidance of the core businesses, I still seem to be coming out short relative to your \u20ac30 billion guidance, unless trading revenue is coming well over double digits and the same for O&A. So it feels like you expect the Corporate Center to continue to positively surprise, is that a fair assessment? And into next year, how does that -- how does the \u20ac500 million valuation timing differences, which we've seen year-to-date, feed into the revenue guidance for next year? And then secondly, it's been a whole [ph] based question, but does the general consensus that as long as rates stay between 2% to 3%, everything is fine. But if rates fall below 2%, it's a different story. So how would you see your interest rate sensitivity changing the further below 2% as we go? Thank you.\nJames Von Moltke: Thanks, Tom. In Q4, I'd say, well, one thing that is not built into the guidance that we referred to is potential performance fees on the asset management side, which they are -- the way they are accounted for, they're not certain until the year is done and final. We do see, as you say, sequential growth in O&A, that's encouraging and that would help against the 7.1 that we're looking at for Q4. And if I just kind of walk forward the momentum we've had so far in FIC markets this year that should also produce, I think, a very solid quarter and contributed to the run rate. So we're encouraged there. Look, the corporate and other lines are hard to predict just by the nature. Valuation and timing, the nice thing this year really in the third quarter, remember, in the first quarter, we had some losses and valuation timing that were -- because of their short nature, actually, the pull to par happen very quickly. There is some longer-dated pull to par that we can already see going forward. It's not a big part of what we're planning for 2025. And overall, I'd say 2025 would probably be a reversal to some degree, from 2024. But it's always hard to predict what goes in those lines. They're very market dependent. I hope that helps kind of square the math.\nThomas Hallett: Yes. Thank you. And then on the right, the 2% to 3% [Indiscernible].\nJames Von Moltke: Yes. Look, it's always hard to predict. But as I've said to the question earlier, obviously, it would be -- we would like for our -- these roles to hedge -- to roll at 2% or more. To be fair, that's what the market expects in terms of a terminal rate in euros. Remember, though, that this is long-term rates. And so the scenarios of a steepening curve especially as you see less liquidity in the market, maybe higher fiscal deficits and other things, you could actually, in the long end, even in scenarios where the short goes down further see higher long-end rates. So it's not just the level, but also the shape of the curve. And what we look at this hard in treasury in our ALCO and ALM processes, how do we lock in as much of the future not just simply by rolling ten years, which is a big part of it for sure, but also by thinking about sort of option structures and other things that can protect specific sort of curve shapes over time. So I don't think it is -- don't think of it as totally linear in terms of our exposure to that environment.\nChristian Sewing: And Tom, just one addition to that. I mean I also think about outside the rate sensitivity. Actually, what kind of investments which we have done over the last 18 months actually in the non-NII business. And exactly for that reason, in order to be really diversified from the revenue streams, that was the reason why we invested into Wealth Management, the fee business part of Corporate Bank and obviously, in the O&A business. So I do believe that even if this would come, that, A, I refer to James' comments, but also the strength of the bank in the non-NII business, which is clearly significantly improving.\nThomas Hallett: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Piers Brown from HSBC. Please go ahead.\nPiers Brown: Yes, good morning. I've just got one final one is just a modeling question in terms of the -- some of the moving parts on capital into next year items that we discussed last quarter. But if you could just tell us whether there's any update to the Basel IV guidance. I think I had about \u20ac7.5 billion versus January 2025, and then another similar amount with FRTB at the beginning of 2026. And then if there's anything to update on the leverage finance reviews on the AVA technical draft, I think those are two other potential moving parts for next year that would be helpful. Thank you.\nJames Von Moltke: Thanks, Piers. No, not much in the way of new news. It's still our estimate \u20ac15 billion in total split basically 50-50 is still about right. So next, the Q1 impact is operational risk related. Q1 2026 would be FRTB related. The OCI filter item that I talked about with Kian would also be a feature then whatever that number is in 2026. So those are the build items that are still left ahead of us. I think, as I say, there are also the possibility of things taking place that give benefits against that future. I mentioned the sectoral buffer against mortgages in Germany, considerably a delay in FRTB. So is the nature of the beast here is that it's a bit of a moving target. But with all of the things that we can see right now, we feel very comfortable in our path. On the leverage, well, the AVA item, which I take to be the question, so the EBA Q&A on additional valuation adjustments, I'm not aware of any real -- any sort of movement there. I know there was an exposure sort of draft, as I might call it, a lot of feedback for the industry, but there hasn't been a reissuance of that. We do, obviously, have very strong views about the ideas that were laid out in the EBA draft. That would be a headwind to our current expectations in capital plan, but we also think that those ideas were excessively conservative and would argue strongly around that. Was your question though, also more broadly about the leverage lending review with the ECB, there wasn't much really to update there either, I have to say.\nChristian Sewing: But we should only say that we are still waiting actually for the final report. I think given all the discussions over the summer, we can only tell you that the number came substantially down. And to be honest, we feel very comfortable with the exposures we have. And now we have to wait for the further debate with ECB.\nPiers Brown: That's fine. Yes, I was actually referring to -- I think we've mentioned in the past is a 15 basis point add-on to your CET1. And I think the way [indiscernible] I'd just assume that or in the form of higher RWA or some form of capital reduction, but [indiscernible].\nJames Von Moltke: No change today to that. As you know, we were given 5 basis points back a year ago, which we took to be a good sign in terms of where we were on a relative basis, but no change to that.\nPiers Brown: Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you very much.\nJames Von Moltke: Thank you Piers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from Andrew Coombs from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Coombs: Good afternoon. Firstly, just a quick clarification. I think in the revenue walk from \u20ac30billion to \u20ac32 billion, you talked about \u20ac300 million to \u20ac400 million incremental NII in PB and CB from deposit growth. Can I just confirm that that's the case and that the \u20ac300 million from the structural hedge tailwind is then on top of that?\nJames Von Moltke: So Andrew, no. Just to be clear, we would expect, ballpark, \u20ac200 million in each of the larger deposit businesses next year and that ties to the disclosure around the hedges. That number is before any benefits of growth in the balance sheet, whether loans or deposits or spreads on either of those two things. So that's why, I think, in Christian's comments, we see upside in NII not just from the rollover, and let's say that's \u20ac300 million to \u20ac400 million depends a little bit still on the interest rate environment, but an incremental NII benefit next year from all those other factors. So I hope that clarifies.\nAndrew Coombs: Okay. And then as a follow-up to that, I always thought the hedge wasn't allocated evenly between PB and CB. So interested in anything you can say on the hedge allocation. And then more broadly, just the deposit margin trends that you're seeing both currently but what you're also assuming going into next year as well? Thank you.\nJames Von Moltke: Yes. So you're right that typically, the longer-term hedges, especially the euro hedge book, is more in the Private Bank and the Corporate Bank. As it happens in this year-on-year comparison, the Corporate Bank had a larger dollar hedge on, which is the same hedge I referred to earlier that's rolling off in Q4. So there's an unusual uplift from a 3-year dollar hedge -- U.S. dollar hedge that the Corporate Bank is benefiting from, that evens out the mix next year. On the -- sorry, what was the second question, just blanking for a second, Andrew.\nAndrew Coombs: It was just on the deposit margins, yes. Can you hear me?\nJames Von Moltke: Deposit margins, yes. Thank you. Yes, sorry for the blank. We still plan arguably with conservative views on deposit margins and beta behavior. Now the scope for upside from conservative assumptions there naturally has diminished because we've sort of gone through the upswing and now the beginning of the downswing of the cycle. We're not seeing anything in terms of behavior today that would suggest more pressure on the banks in terms of pricing. And so that's encouraging. But as I say, the scope for over-earning at this point in the cycle is obviously less. I'm going to say in beta terms, single-digit percentages rather than double-digit percentages that we once had.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this was the last question. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ioana Patriniche for any closing remarks.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you for joining us, and thank you for your questions. For any follow-up, please come through to the Investor Relations team, and we look forward to speaking to you on our fourth quarter call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now over. Thank you for choosing Chorus Call, and thank you for participating in the conference. You may now disconnect your lines. Goodbye.",

        "text": "Thank you Ioana, and a warm welcome from me. I'm delighted to be discussing our third quarter and nine month results with you today. These show our ongoing strong operating performance, further reinforcing our confidence in our 2024 ambitions and 2025 financial targets. I'm particularly pleased that our continued intense client engagement has supported momentum in all businesses. This enabled us to generate revenues of \u20ac22.9 billion in the first nine months, putting us well on track towards our goal of \u20ac30 billion for the year. We recorded the third successive quarter of adjusted costs at \u20ac5 billion, inline with our 2024 guidance underpinning our forward trajectory. We are pleased with the settlements we achieved in August and September in the Postbank takeover litigation matter, equivalent to around 60% of the total claims by value. This resulted in a litigation release that supported our reported pretax profit of \u20ac2.3 billion, up over \u20ac500 million year-on-year, and our reported post tax return on tangible equity of 10.2% in the third quarter. For the first nine months, our reported RoTE stood at 6%, excluding the Postbank takeover litigation related impact, RoTE was 7.8%, up from 7% in the prior year period. Asset quality remains stable despite the sequential increase in our provision for credit losses, which James will go through in more detail. Importantly, we expect provisions to reduce towards more normalized levels going forward, particular in expectation of improvements in commercial real estate over the next quarters. Our CET1 ratio of 13.8% reflects our strong organic capital generation. This puts us on a clear path to distribute capital to our shareholders as planned and we have now sought authorization from the ECB for our next share buyback. Let me now discuss in more detail some of the drivers of our nine month results on slide three. Disciplined execution of our Global Hausbank strategy is driving steadily improving performance and operating leverage. Pre provision profit grew by 17% year-on-year to \u20ac7 billion in the first nine months, with operating leverage of 5%, both excluding the Postbank takeover litigation related impact. Growth was driven by both revenue momentum and cost discipline. Nine months revenues grew 3% year-on-year, with around 75% of revenues coming from more predictable income streams. Reported non-interest revenues were up 14% year-on-year with continued strong growth in commissions and fee income of 9%. This demonstrates that our strategy of growing our capital light business is paying off. At the same time, net interest income in our key banking book segments remain stable and better than anticipated at the beginning of the year. We remain focused on expense discipline, keeping our adjusted cost to \u20ac15.1 billion or \u20ac5 billion per quarter as we continue to offset inflation while allowing for investments by delivering savings from our operational efficiency program. Our cost income ratio, excluding Postbank litigation related impacts, improved to 69% from 73% year-on-year. Now let's look at the franchise achievements across our business on slide four. The corporate bank increased the number of deals won with multinational clients by 18% compared to the first nine months of the prior year. We also had strong momentum in commissions and fee income, which grew by 5% across all regions. At the same time, NII remained resilient, supported by continued pricing discipline and deposit growth of 8% year-on-year. In the investment bank we increased activity so far this year with our priority institutional clients by 11%, demonstrating the ongoing commitment and focus of our business and coverage teams in supporting our clients. Nine months revenues in fixed income and currencies were up 5% year-on-year, supported by a 5% increase in financing revenues, even compared to a strong prior year. Looking at the third quarter, FIC demonstrated a strong performance and was up by 11% year-on-year. Origination & Advisory grew revenues by 58% and increased its global market share year-to-date compared to the full year 2023. While we maintained our number one ranking in our home market. The Private Bank sees further momentum with \u20ac27 billion of net inflows and grew non-interest revenues by 5% year-on-year, driven by higher margin products in volumes across both client segments. The division continues to transform its personal banking unit with around 50 branch closures year-to-date and more to come. The business also announced to a further optimization of our Deutsche Bank branch network in the quarter which will start next year. Asset Management grew assets under management by \u20ac67 billion year-to-date to \u20ac963 billion. This was boosted by continued strong inflows into our diverse product suite, which should support future revenues. The Group also made progress on its sustainability strategy including ESG rating upgrades. In October, S&P\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Assessment was upgraded to 66 and is now within the top decile of the financial industry. The MSCI rating was upgraded to AA from A. Let me turn to our progress against our strategic objectives on slide five. Our third quarter results demonstrates our continued progress across all three pillars of our Global Hausbank strategy. Starting with revenue growth our well diversified and complementary business mix delivered a compound annual growth rate of 5.6% since 2021, in line with our upgraded target range, and we expect it to increase from here. For the remainder of the year we anticipate continued momentum in commissions and fee income, driven by ongoing high client engagement and our franchise strengths, while NII remains stable. This gives us full confidence in reaching our revenue ambition of \u20ac30 billion for the full year 2024, providing a strong step off into 2025. Moving to costs, we continue to deliver on our Operational Efficiency program, having completed measures with delivered or expected gross savings of \u20ac1.7 billion, almost 70% of our target with around \u20ac1.5 billion in savings already realized. We have made further progress on workforce reductions, including 600 FTEs in the third quarter, bringing the total number to more than 90% of the 2024 year-end target. The achieved progress to date and efficiency still in the pipeline will support our adjusted cost run rate for the remainder of 2024 and further reductions in 2025 to meet our objective of around \u20ac20 billion in non-interest expenses while continuing to invest in business growth, technology and controls. Lastly, we delivered a further benefit of \u20ac3 billion of RWA equivalent reductions in the third quarter, driven by data and process improvements. This brings total RWA equivalent reductions from capital efficiency measures to \u20ac22 billion, which puts us inside of our end 2025 target range of \u20ac20 billion to \u20ac30 billion more than one year early. We expect to achieve further reductions from securitizations as well as data and process enhancements, and we continue to work on finding further incremental optimization opportunities to exceed our target. Let me conclude with a few words on our strategy on slide six. Our operating performance in the first nine months shows that our Global Hausbank strategy positions us well to serve our client\u2019s needs and continues to deliver growth and profitability. We have firm confidence in reaching our RoTE of at least 10% next year. To be clear, our focus remains on us, our strategy and financial targets, unlocking further value for shareholders through the measures we have underway. Looking at revenues into 2025, we expect continued franchise momentum and our capital light businesses to drive further growth, harvesting investments we have made and are still making. In the corporate bank, we expect further growth in commissions and fee income from our investments in our fee based institutional business as well as our payment platforms. FIC is expected to show further improvements into next year, benefiting from our investments into the franchise in both existing and adjacent businesses, as well as continued strengthen in financing. In ONA, we have a clear value proposition to our clients supported by our investments, which should help us to further increase our market share in what we expect to be a growing market environment with further benefit of new hires still to come. At the same time, the private bank anticipates growing non-interest income, mainly from investment products, predominantly in wealth management and private banking, further supported by NII. Within our Asset Management business, we expect to benefit from higher assets under management levels this year, which should lead to an increase in management fees in 2025. Additionally, we anticipate positive flows into the Alternatives business and continued growth in passive including X-trackers. These drivers underline our confidence in achieving our revenue goal of \u20ac32 billion in 2025. Turning to costs, we have taken decisive action to put legacy items behind us, substantially reducing our risk profile and driving restructuring measures in order to clear the path to 2025 and we continue to focus on controls to future proof the franchise which will help us reduce non-operating costs. The delivery of operational efficiencies is expected to further reduce adjusted costs over the coming quarters. Together, we are confident these measures will bring us on a path to around \u20ac20 billion of non-interest expenses in 2025, which will also support delivery of robust operating leverage. We expect credit costs to reduce towards more normalized levels in 2025, largely driven by the expected continuation of the positive development of CRE provisions and the benefits of interest rate reductions flowing through into the economy, providing us with a much cleaner slate into 2025. We remain dedicated to creating values for our shareholders and confident that with achieving our financial targets, we can also maintain our trajectory to increase distributions beyond our original goal of \u20ac8 billion in respect of the financial years 2021 to 2025. Given this continued progress, we have now thought authorization from the ECB for our next share buyback. To sum up, we remain focused on our Global Hausbank strategy and with our business momentum and all the progress made, we have clear line of sight on our target of an RoTE of greater than 10% for 2025. With that, let me hand over to James."

        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Thank you Christian, and good morning. As usual, let me start with a few key performance indicators on slide eight and place them in the context of our 2025 targets. As Christian mentioned before, we are on track towards our objectives and we expect further improvements over the coming quarters. Our liquidity metrics also remain strong. Liquidity coverage ratio was 135% above our target of around 130% and the net stable funding ratio was 122%. In short, our performance in the period reaffirms our franchise strength and our confidence in reaching the 2025 targets. With that, let me turn to the third quarter highlights on slide nine. Group revenues were \u20ac7.5 billion, up 5% on the prior year quarter. Non-interest expenses were \u20ac4.7 billion, down 8%, benefitting from a partial release of the Postbank takeover litigation provision following the settlements in the third quarter. A provision of \u20ac547 million remains in place for the outstanding plaintiff claims. The settlements achieved in August and September enabled us to release around \u20ac440 million of Postbank-related provisions in the quarter which were partially offset by charges of around \u20ac90 million related to other legacy litigation items. Non-operating costs were positive \u20ac302 million in the quarter, including a net litigation release of \u20ac344 million and restructuring and severance charges of \u20ac42 million. We generated a profit before tax of \u20ac2.3 billion, up 31%, and a net profit of \u20ac1.7 billion, up 39% to the prior year quarter. Our tax rate in the quarter of 26% was impacted by the aforementioned litigation effects. In the third quarter, diluted earnings per share was \u20ac0.81 and tangible book value per share was \u20ac29.34, up 6% year-on-year. Let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results. We remain well positioned to continue delivering strong net interest income over the coming years, so let me start with a review of our NII on slide 10. NII across key banking book segments was \u20ac3.2 billion, and our trajectory continues to outperform our guidance from earlier in the year. Compared to the prior quarter, higher deposit volumes and loan margin expansion offset expected beta convergence in the Corporate Bank, although reported NII includes lower levels of CLO recoveries than in the prior quarter. Private Bank was stable sequentially, reflecting ongoing strength in deposit revenues. Our base case remains that our quarterly NII run rate will continue to be broadly stable and we reiterate that we expect full-year banking book NII to remain in line with the \u20ac13.1 billion reported in 2023, despite absorbing a headwind of around \u20ac150 million versus 2023, from the discontinuation of the minimum reserve remuneration. Our hedging strategy has positioned us well for a declining rate environment, as outlined on page 32 in the appendix. Our hedge portfolio stabilizes our income by extending the tenor of interest rate risk, but it also protects us against a drop in interest rates, and to that end we have increased the notional of our hedge portfolio over the last 12 to 18 months in response to the slower-than-expected rise in deposit betas. The weighted average maturity of our hedges is around 5 years. Based on current forward rates, we expect the income from the hedge book to grow by \u20ac300 million to \u20ac400 million each year as we roll maturing hedges. As such, we expect the hedge portfolio to provide a long-term tailwind to our revenues at current forward rates. With respect to 2025, more than 90% of the income is locked in with existing positions already. With that, let\u2019s turn to adjusted cost development, on slide 11. Adjusted costs were \u20ac5 billion for the quarter, in line with our guidance. Savings from streamlining our IT platform and lower spend for professional services were offset by higher costs for compensation and benefits, which increased by 4% year-on-year. The increase reflected wage growth as expected, higher performance-related compensation and increases in internal workforce after our targeted investments throughout 2023, partially offset by further workforce optimization. Let\u2019s now turn to provision for credit losses on slide 12. As Christian mentioned, I will elaborate on the headwinds which have persisted this year, but let\u2019s start with this quarter\u2019s provision for credit losses, which was \u20ac494 million, equivalent to 41 basis points of average loans. Stage 1 and 2 provisions were on a moderate level, as various portfolio effects largely offset increases from softer macroeconomic forecasts and overlay recalibrations in the third quarter. Stage 3 provisions increased sequentially to \u20ac482 million mainly driven by the Private Bank, including transitional Postbank integration effects. Provisions in the Corporate Bank remained stable and included the gross impact from a larger corporate restructuring event, which had already impacted the second quarter. Investment Bank provisions were slightly lower sequentially, given the anticipated and substantial improvement in Commercial Real Estate in the quarter, including a negative impact of \u20ac23 million from the expected CRE loan portfolio sale, which is underway and where we have gained pricing visibility. Let me now take you through some additional detail on our provisions on slide 13. This year, we faced several headwinds, which negatively impacted provisions and our full-year guidance, but which we do not expect to persist into 2025 at all, or in the same magnitude depending on the item. First, the transitional effects from the Postbank integration led to longer-than-expected impacts across our internal collection and recovery processes, but we expect these to fade over the coming quarters. Second, we have been dealing with two relatively fast-paced larger corporate events, impacting year-to-date provisions at a level unusual compared to historical standards. However, the pre-tax impact was mitigated by around 70%, as these loans benefitted from credit-concentration hedging. And lastly, our full-year CRE provision run rate has been at a cyclically higher level, but has now substantially declined quarter on quarter, as envisaged. We continue to see more signs of stabilization, which supports our confidence in a gradual reduction in future provisions. In general, we maintain tight underwriting standards and continue to conservatively manage our loan book which includes managing single-name concentration risks through comprehensive hedging programs, including our recently issued Significant Risk Transfer transactions, which bring the total notional volume of hedges to \u20ac41 billion. Our regular and comprehensive portfolio reviews, including close assessment of trends at the sub-segment level and deeper dives into more vulnerable sectors, show that overall credit quality remains stable; forward-looking indicators such as rating migration and trends in our non-investment grade portfolio and watchlist ratios do not suggest a noteworthy deterioration in asset quality. We also see broadly stable developments in our domestic market, as outlined on page 38 of the appendix. Our \u20ac220 billion German loan book is low risk and well diversified across businesses, and 70% of the portfolio is either collateralized or supported by financial guarantees. We also have more than \u20ac12 billion in hedges. More than three quarters of the book is in the Private Bank, of which around 90% consists of low-risk German retail mortgages. Our corporate loan book is well diversified and of high quality. Exposure is predominantly to multi-national corporates and MidCaps, with almost 70% of loans rated investment grade. Importantly, early warning indicators in Germany remain robust; the number of limits subject to our watchlist remains largely unchanged since the end of last year and we do not observe any significant, broad-based rating deterioration across the portfolio. In summary, our portfolio is holding up well and adjusting our reported gross provisions for offsetting effects from recoveries through hedging, which are captured as revenues, our pro-forma year-to-date net provisions would have been around 34 basis points. We continue to expect a sequential reduction in provisions, towards more normalized levels as we go into 2025. Before we move to performance in our businesses, let me turn to capital on slide 14. Our third-quarter Common Equity Tier 1 ratio came in at 13.8%, 30 basis points higher compared to the previous quarter. The increase was largely driven by CET1 capital, reflecting strong earnings net of deductions, and an approximately \u20ac790 million or 22-basis-point positive effect from the adoption of the Article 468 CRR transitional rule for unrealized gains and losses. Risk-weighted assets increased for market risk and credit risk. The credit risk RWA increase was driven by model impacts and business growth, mostly offset by reductions from capital efficiency measures. Lower operational risk RWA were driven by the partial release of the Postbank takeover litigation provision. At the end of the third quarter our leverage ratio was 4.6%, flat sequentially, as higher leverage exposure driven by securities financing transactions and trading assets offset an increase in Tier 1 capital in line with the CET1 capital development. With that, let\u2019s now turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on slide 16. Corporate Bank revenues in the third quarter were \u20ac1.8 billion essentially flat year-on-year, as normalization of deposit margins was mostly offset by higher deposit volumes, growth in commissions and fee income, and increased loan NII. The 5% increase in commissions and fee income in the first nine months reflects the impact of our growth initiatives and shows good progress to offset the normalization of deposit revenues. In the third quarter, commissions and fee income was 4% higher year-on-year, reflecting growth in our Institutional Client Services business, and essentially flat compared to the seasonally strong second quarter. Deposits increased by \u20ac7 billion in the quarter and are \u20ac23 billion higher year-on-year driven by higher term and sight deposits across currencies. This growth was partially driven by certain client accommodation activities, which we expect to normalize in the fourth quarter. Provision for credit losses was at \u20ac126 million, in line with the previous quarter, and increased significantly year-on-year driven by higher stage 3 provisions and the non-recurrence of a one-off model change in stage 1 and 2 in the prior year. Higher stage 3 provisions included a larger corporate restructuring event, which had already impacted the second quarter and was partially covered by risk mitigation measures. Non-interest expenses were slightly higher year-on-year driven by front office investments and higher internal service cost allocations. This resulted in a post-tax return on tangible equity of 13.1% and a cost/income ratio of 64%. I\u2019ll now turn to the Investment Bank on slide 17. Revenues for the third quarter were 11% higher year-on-year on a reported basis, driven by improvements across both FIC and O&A. Revenues in Fixed Income & Currencies also increased by 11%, driven by significantly higher Credit Trading and Emerging Markets revenues and supported by stable performance in Financing Credit Trading showed strength in the Distressed business and continued performance in Flow, reflecting investments made into the franchise. Emerging Markets demonstrated year-on-year growth across regions. Foreign Exchange revenues were higher, with continued strength in Spot, while revenues in Rates were lower in a market environment that continues to be uncertain. Moving to O&A, revenues were significantly higher than in the prior year, with increases across business lines reflecting a growing industry fee pool. Debt Origination revenues were higher, driven by increased industry activity across Investment Grade and Leveraged Debt. Advisory revenues were strong and materially higher year-on-year, with the business benefitting from prior period investments. Non-interest expenses and adjusted costs were both essentially flat year-on-year, with the impact of strategic investments offset by lower infrastructure allocations. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac135 million, or 52 basis points of average loans. The previous year quarter materially benefitted from a provision release from model changes. Turning to the Private Bank on slide 18. Revenues in the quarter were \u20ac2.3 billion, essentially flat, with non-interest revenue growth of 7% year-on-year. The decline in NII was driven by continued higher funding costs from the impact of minimum reserves, the Group-neutral impact of certain hedging costs as well as a negative episodic effect from our lending books, mainly in Personal Banking. Excluding these effects, third-quarter revenues in the Private Bank would have been up 4% year-on-year. Personal Banking continues to record higher deposit revenues in Germany which were more than offset by the aforementioned impacts weighing on the net interest income. Wealth Management & Private Banking grew revenues by 5% to \u20ac1 billion, driven by higher lending and investment revenues, partially offset by lower deposit revenues. We continue to see good business momentum with net inflows into assets under management of \u20ac8 billion in the quarter mainly in Wealth Management & Private Banking. The Private Bank continues the transformation of the Personal Banking business in Germany with around 50 branch closures and further workforce reductions in the first nine months of the year. Savings have been offset this quarter by higher infrastructure cost allocations and higher compensation expenses, including wage inflation, as well as continued residual expenses for service remediation. As announced in the fourth quarter of 2022, the refinement of our methodology to allocate infrastructure costs resulted in Group-neutral year-on-year expense shifts between the businesses, noticeable this quarter in the Private Bank; however, even including the allocations, adjusted costs were down 2% in the first nine months, compared to the prior year period. Looking ahead, we foresee the Private Bank to resume the cost reduction path next quarter with residual costs for service remediation to continue to taper and further benefits from ongoing transformation, including from the integration of the IT platform and further branch closures. As I outlined earlier, credit quality of our domestic and international portfolios remains high. Loan loss provisions this quarter still included \u20ac40 million of transitional Postbank integration effects which should cease. Let me continue with Asset Management on slide 19. My usual reminder: the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Profit before tax improved by 54% from the prior year period, reflecting operating leverage from higher revenues and stable noninterest expenses. Revenues increased by 11%, driven by management fees of \u20ac626 million. This growth from both Active and Passive products reflected increasing average assets under management from market development and net inflows. Performance and transaction fees were significantly lower driven by the impact of real estate valuations and lower transaction volumes in Alternatives. Non-interest expenses were 1% lower, while adjusted costs were essentially flat compared to the prior year. Lower non-compensation costs, particularly in IT, offset slightly higher compensation and benefits costs. Assets under management increased by \u20ac30 billion to \u20ac963 billion resulting in record-high assets under management levels. The increase was attributable to positive market appreciation and net inflows. The positive net inflow trend for Passive continues, with a further \u20ac10 billion gathered in the quarter, resulting in over \u20ac27 billion of net inflows year-to-date. Active Fixed Income contributed with net inflows of \u20ac10 billion in the quarter, more than offsetting net outflows in Active Equity, Multi-Asset and Alternatives products. The cost/income ratio for the quarter declined to 67% and return on tangible equity was 18.9%, both improving from the third quarter last year. Moving to Corporate & Other on slide 20. - Corporate & Other reported a pre-tax profit of \u20ac424 million compared to a pre-tax loss of \u20ac202 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by a provision release in the Postbank takeover litigation matter of around \u20ac440 million. Revenues were positive \u20ac157 million; this compares to positive \u20ac35 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by valuation and timing differences, which were positive \u20ac295 million, reflecting partial reversion of prior period losses and impacts from market moves. The pre-tax losses associated with legacy portfolios were \u20ac142 million driven primarily by provisions for legacy litigation items. At the end of the quarter, risk-weighted assets stood at \u20ac34 billion, including \u20ac13 billion of operational risk RWA. In aggregate, RWAs have reduced by \u20ac8 billion year-on-year, mainly reflecting a change in the allocation of operational risk RWA. Leverage exposure was \u20ac36 billion at the end of the quarter, slightly lower than the prior year quarter. Finally, let me turn to the Group outlook on slide 21. Our ongoing performance demonstrates the successful execution of our strategy. Our revenue trajectory remains on track to \u20ac30 billion for this year, on the path to our goal for \u20ac32 billion in 2025. Looking at the fourth quarter and starting with the Corporate Bank, we expect revenues to remain essentially flat sequentially, as growth in non-interest revenues compensates for lower deposit income. In the Investment Bank, we expect a strong performance across our businesses in FIC, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. We are encouraged by our fourth-quarter pipeline in Origination & Advisory, which is higher year-on-year and suggests positive momentum for the remainder of 2024, both sequentially and year-on-year. The Private Bank is expected to grow revenues sequentially driven by higher NII. Finally, we expect Asset Management to grow revenues as the momentum of the last six months carries over and further accelerates into the fourth quarter, with potential upside from performance fees. We expect to further reduce our adjusted cost run rate closer to \u20ac4.9 billion in the coming quarters to allow us to achieve around \u20ac20 billion of non-interest expenses in 2025. The reduction should come through a combination of ongoing cost discipline and benefits from our efficiency and tactical measures. We expect reported provision for credit losses for 2024 to land at around \u20ac1.8 billion, higher than our prior guidance, but we continue to expect an amelioration will follow next year, as the transitory headwinds we called out will pass, leading to a reduction towards more normalized levels. Our robust operating performance in the third quarter, including the ongoing work in putting legacy items behind us, helps us lay the foundation for delivery in 2025. Furthermore, our strong capital position gives us a good step off for our 2025 and 2026 distribution objectives. And as Christian said, our full focus remains on the execution of our own strategy. With that, let me hand back to Ioana, and we look forward to your questions."

And then what should give us the confidence that the loan losses can come down in Q4 and 2025? I mean you show us slide 13 should the Postbank integration and the large corporate events almost drop out or drop out in 2025? And when you gave us 24 guidance and we've been looking, sorry to say, about two quarters of upward revision. So what did you underestimate when you previously guided for 2024. And then second on the buybacks. Yes, great to hear you applied for approval. But can you be more specific on the amount should we use the slide 24 where you talk about the 50% increase year-over-year as a potential indicator of your request at this time? And what does it mean for potential additional buybacks in calendar year 2025? When do you think you can make a decision and is that a function of the loan loss charge guidance as well? And maybe that\u2019s an opportunity to say something about the still outstanding settlements post the Postbank ruling today. Thank you very much."

Let me start with the share buybacks because that also goes into the direction of, so to say, the most recent ruling of the Cologne court. First of all with the share buyback. As we always said after the full provisioning of the Postbank litigation case in April, we always said, we want to show to you two clean quarters, Q2, Q3 which we did. And even without the release which we recorded in the third quarter for Postbank, we have shown a record quarter for Deutsche bank in the third quarter. And that gave us then obviously the conviction and the clear path now to apply for a share buyback. By the way, I think with the 13.8 core tier one, this is also a nice step which gives us the confidence for the application. With regard to amounts and timing, we always do it like in the past. We obviously keep that discussion with our regulator. But I can tell you that there is full confidence with James and myself and the management team that based on the step off of 30.8%, based on the trajectory of our operating results, we are convinced of our distribution of above 8 billion for the time zone between 21 and 25. So nothing changed. Also, what I would like to emphasize is actually that today's ruling you have just seen that is not actually affecting our share buyback because we provisioned that amount in full and also in our capital plan going forward we did actually not assume further releases in our capital plan. So in this regard of course we don't like the ruling and now we have to analyze it and think about potential next steps. But for the capital plan going forward and for the share buyback this is no impact because we are fully provisioned. And in this regard we remain convinced and confident that we can deliver above the 8 billion. For us it was important to show two good quarters and solid quarters in terms of operating performance. And I think we see that from a revenue point of view, from a cost point of view and hence with the underlying result. Let me briefly go over to the loan loss provision question because I understand that that obviously raises some questions on your side. Look, I really think it's important that we look into the composition of the loan loss provision and what really drove the number to 494 million this quarter. And yes, we said that we see in the second half of 2024, a decreasing trend. Let me explain why this did not happen. Number one, I know you, you are looking with concerns to Germany and the commercial real estate with regards to both items. To be honest, I see robust portfolio quality. In particular, if I look at the corporate side and the private banking side and the underlying loan loss provisions in Germany, we don't see any material change. We don't see any material change in the portfolio composition. If you look at indicators like up versus downgrades, if you look like additions to watch lists, this is not a concerning trend. Now, what increased in the private bank is still the result of the backlog in the Postbank operations that actually we thought that this comes earlier down. It will come down. We even will see some bookings. That is, in terms of that, we will see releases of certain reserves in 2025. So the trend is coming down and we will see releases. But we hoped actually for a faster reduction in this regard during the year 2024. So that is one item. The second item, I think, which is underlying positive is on the commercial real estate. If you actually look at the underlying portfolio composition, the trend is coming down. It's for the first time that commercial real estate provisions have come down sequentially, quarter-over-quarter. And it would have come even more down if we wouldn't have done a portfolio sale where we got the first mark and where actually we booked an additional provision from the portfolio sale in the low double digit number, that is obviously capital accretive. But overall, the commercial real estate provisions are coming down, and that is, again, something which we forecasted at the start of the year. But to be honest, we thought that this is already happening in Q2, now it is coming in, in Q3. Now, if I take all these items, and the third item, sorry, I should have said that is one larger loan loss provision in the south of Germany for a corporate name which is, though significantly hedged. So if you see the net loss position which we have from that, it is obviously far less than the gross loan loss provision which we have booked in Q3 that was also, by the way, a name where we already booked the first loan provision in Q2. So if you take these three items, the Postbank item, which will come down, and we even see reversals of bookings in 2025, if you see the underlying rate in the commercial real estate, and on top of that, if you look at the one name where we had gross loan provisions, but which was significantly hedged, actually, we see also with regard to 2025, and that was that what James was referring to in his prepared remarks, a normalized run rate for loan loss provisions of \u20ac350 million. And that is actually where we see, based on the portfolio quality, we have the trend going. And in this regard, I do think that we have seen now in this quarter, the peak of the loan loss provisions, with that number coming down to approximately 350 million per quarter in the 2025 year."

As I said, the 8 billion to us is a number that we think we're confident will exceed. We're not going to go into precise euro numbers at this point, but I think 24 lays out a good path. As it relates to incremental buybacks next year it's very early to make that determination. As we've talked about, there are lots of moving parts in a capital plan. Under the best of circumstances, next year we'll have CRR3 coming due in two phases, changes in the environment, potential upside in areas like, for example, the sectoral buffer that's been applied in Germany to mortgages. So lots of moving parts that at this point, one doesn't want to get ahead of. So we'll make that decision much later in 25 than today's application."

      {
        "speaker": "Flora Bocahut",
        "text": "Yes, thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have one on NII and one on cost, please. So on the NII, could we come back, please, to the drop? We saw this quarter in the corporate bank. It's led the banking book and AI to be just 3.2 billion this quarter. And I think the full year guidance you have implies it would be, again, about that level in Q4. I mean, when I look at the slide, 32 and it's useful. Thank you very much for putting in that slide. I see you blocked a significant part of the hedge income already for the next two years, so that's very reassuring. I also see that you've used a ten year swap that would be 2.3 to 2.5%. That makes sense based on today's curve. But, the risk here is rather to the downside. So the question here is also, the light blue column, the contribution from the rollover of the hedges. If, you know, the ten year swap would go towards, say, 2% or 2.2%, would we still see, the rollover, contribute positively in the next two years, despite, on top of what you've locked already? So that's for NII. And then the second question is on cost. I think you were saying before, James, that to make your guidance for 2025 cost, you would need to get adjusted cost quarterly run rate down towards \u20ac4.9 billion. Obviously, you just had three quarters in a row where you've met the guidance for this year at \u20ac5.0 billion. So maybe could you talk a little bit into the capacity for you to get there already in Q4? And what gives you the confidence that you can get to \u20ac4.9 billion quarterly run rate for adjusted cost next year? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James von Moltke",
        "text": "Thank you, Flora. Happy to answer those questions. So, on the NII disclosure that we provide, you're right, there's, of course, some risk on the rollover of the hedges. We like that. We've locked in 90% for next year. And, yes, we use the implied forward curve to look at what the future might be. The dark blue is as I say what's locked in for the next several years. Remember, of course, that the gap is against hedges that are rolling off, that were essentially at zero or very, very low. So the idea that there may be a little bit of downside in the light blue bars, that's true. But the quantum is against very low hedges put in many years ago, as much as ten years ago in that rollover. And that actually goes to the first part of your question, which is the corporate bank. Yes, we had in the series sort of a low point in the corporate bank, but actually there are some hedges that now roll off in the fourth quarter into chunks, and that gives us some good visibility into the trajectory for the corporate bank. If I think about the two businesses separately, we are -- we think we may have passed the low point in the trajectory for private bank already now in Q3, and we'll be passing that low point in Q4 for the corporate bank. It's obviously early to make that judgment and we'll see how everything plays out, including the balance sheet growth, deposit growth betas and what have you. But we think we're on a path now to be rising in 2025, not just because of the benefit of the long-term hedges. So it's overall quite encouraging pictures as we see it. Going to costs. Yes, absolutely. We're focused sort of every day on managing the run rate down, and I think we've said in the past towards \u20ac4.9 billion that remains our objective here. The trajectory in the first three quarters of this year has been encouraging. And even in the third quarter, I can point to some things that are, that are of a non-recurring nature in the third quarter, I think so. I think we're close to or at the \u20ac5 billion level, but we need to continue working it down from this point. And that is the full focus of the firm. We have the projects and the initiatives in place to do that. So for us, it's just about additional delivery of our operational efficiency program. We've talked about it in the past. It's optimization initiatives in Germany. We've announced some more actions on the distribution network in Germany. We've been investing in technology and we're having harvesting some of the benefits of that. I think we have a very successful track record now on workforce optimization, because what you see in the overall headcount, as well as the compensation and benefits line, is the impact of reductions in force that we've implemented reinvestments both in the front office in technology and controls, all of which we've managed within the run rate and we think we've got a whole raft of initiatives of a strategic nature underway to deliver further on those run rate improvements as well as tactical steps that we've been taking throughout the year and will continue to take to ensure we deliver on the objectives. Hope that all helps, Flora."

So just to understand, first of all, the dynamic, but also your decision process or why you've taken the benefit. And then second question is related to your 2025 revenues, you need to grow revenues just under 7% from \u20ac30 billion to \u20ac32 billion, even if you adjust for the \u20ac300 million delta on your hedges, clearly it's quite an upward sloping curve in terms of revenue growth in a more difficult German environment. And maybe you could just outline a bit how we should think about your assumptions in a more difficult German environment, and I'm not sure what your German environment outlook is in 2025 in terms of reaching that \u20ac32 billion, especially, again, Corporate Bank 2025 and then Private Bank in 2025."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Thank you, Kian. Let me start with the revenues and James is then going to your capital question. Look, first of all, before we talk about 2025 and fully understood your question, I think it's very encouraging that we have full sight on the \u20ac30 billion for 2024. And again, I think we have established a track record in achieving our revenue guidance for the last years. And if I look actually where we stand at the end of the third quarter, how actually October started in particular on the trading side. You just heard James talking about sort of say, a potential low point in the NII in the Private Bank, then also where equity indices are and what that potentially means for performance fees and asset management, we are super confident that we can achieve the \u20ac30 billion, which is obviously the right jump-off your question regarding the \u20ac32 billion. Now when we come to the \u20ac32 billion, look, the first item is, again, a continuation of that for James outlined on the NII side because everything what we can see from our forecast, given our hedging profile, but also, in particular, looking at our deposit growth, which we see in the Corporate Bank, but also in the Private Bank, we do feel that actually, just from an NII across the bank and in particular, carried by the Corporate Bank and by the Private Bank, we do see an upside of approximately \u20ac300 million to \u20ac400 million on the NII side. By the way, Kian, that does not include the expected growth on the financing volume, in particular also in [Indiscernible] business in the Investment Bank. So that when I look at the forecast, just from the financing part in that area and the NII part, obviously, my starting position is then \u20ac500 million up, i.e., \u20ac30.5 million. And now let's go through the businesses and, in particular, look at the investments which we have done over the last 18 months to move the businesses, in particular in the non-NII area. There's, of course, the Investment Bank, and there the O&A business. You have seen with the last quarters that we clearly outperformed the market. We have grown market share. Actually, not everybody, so to say, which we hired over the last 18 months is yet obviously running at full speed. So this is still to come. So we actually expect in the O&A business further market share gains, and we also expect actually that 2025, with all indications we have from our from our mandates, which we see for Q4 and Q1 already, this will be a year with actually higher fees for the banks. And that means if you have a higher market share, which we already increased by 60 or 70 basis points, which we will obviously benefit. So we do believe that, just in the O&A business, we see upside of another \u20ac500 million towards the number which we are printing for the year 2024. Then we have invested and you have also seen over the last years actually to compliment here, Ram Nayak, we have seen constant increases in market share in the FIC business. I think we have done a terrific job over there. Now if you follow Ram's planning going forward, obviously, we have an eye in certain areas, so to say, business areas like credit. But also from a regional point of view, we invested quite significantly over the last 9 months into our U.S. franchise. So I would say, with the market shares, which we definitely also won again in Q3 with the investments we have done in that business, there is also further increases to come from the FIC business in the Investment Bank. Then let's turn to the private bank. So I talked about the NII profile. But obviously, the biggest lever, which we see in the Private Bank. And there, we see actually already a good momentum on the wealth management side. But if you look at the assets under management, which are increasing steadily, I think we are year-to-date in the private bank, approximately \u20ac27 billion or \u20ac29 billion assets under management. We will obviously benefit from that NIC [ph] to the NII I described before, similar, by the way, on the assets under management in Asset Management in Stefan's book. So that I also clearly expect a 3-digit million increase in revenues in asset management next year. And that leaves me with the Corporate Bank. I think the Corporate Bank in itself is a success story. This is, in the meantime, so to say, at the heart of the bank. Quarter-by-quarter, we are increasing the mandates we get from our corporate clients around the world. There is clearly, clearly, the trend of the corporates around the world to go for at least one alternative to the U.S. banks. They would like to have the European alternative. With the network we have and the investments we have done in our platform, payment platform business, as well into our digital offerings, we can see further increases in the fee business there. So all-in-all, starting actually at \u20ac30.5 billion with the hedging profile on the NII side, and looking at the track record, I'm very confident that the \u20ac32 billion is a number which we can achieve. And last but not least, if I really think about 2025, if you think about the walk and the normalized costs we have on the loan loss provision, clearly reduced costs on the legal side. James was just talking about all our efforts and also progress we are doing on the operating cost side. And we will have less restructuring costs. To be honest, Kian, but you know me personally, we don't even need \u20ac32 billion of revenues in order to go to the 10%. But that doesn't mean that I'm trying to put a soft touch on the \u20ac32 billion. I think you have heard my absolute conviction that \u20ac32 billion is definitely achievable."

        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "And Kian, just to touch your OCI filter, the CRR3 rule that we're taking advantage of. I think the short answer is, because it's there. The time value of capital in our ratio, especially as we're often measured against a distance to MDA appears, to us to be valuable and hence, the decision to take advantage of that transitional arrangement. Remember that the 22 basis points could be a lower number when the time comes that the transition benefit is over. So the passage of time and the book of securities that are generating those unrealized losses, we'll see some attrition and then the interest environmental change. So it's a number that may be considerably lower than 20 basis points when that transition period ends. And therefore, we think it's valuable for our shareholders to be able to redeploy that capital during that 18-month period."

Look, on the M&A side and on the specific potential situation you're referring to in Germany, that doesn't change our strategy at all. I think we have a very solid and a very good footprint in Germany, both in the Private Bank as well as in the Corporate Bank. We have worked on, obviously, on two sites in Germany to make that even more attractive. A, you see all the work just done by Claudio, in particular, in the Retail Bank to make this business more efficient. We know that there is work to be done, but I can see how Claudio you is actually focusing on that to have an efficient platform to offer digitalized products to our retail clients. And honestly, quarter-by-quarter, also with the feedback we get from the clients, we see clear improvement. On the Corporate Side, I think, again, what I said before, it was the right decision to establish ourselves with an own Corporate Bank and to make sure that we are, sort of say, the bank for German Mittelstand family-owned clients and obviously the large clients to support them domestically, but in particular, when they go abroad. And in this regard, we feel that we are rightly positioned. And with all the efficiency programs, we can actually see that the profitability in the German business on both sides is further increasing and will further increase. Now whenever it comes to these kind of potential items, to be honest, Chris, we shouldn't underestimate the opportunities for us. Because at the end of the day, it creates uncertainty, it creates uncertainty, so to say, with the other institutions, but in particular also with the clients. And we are ready to act. And this is what we established over the last three years to four years, both in the Corporate Bank and in the Private Bank. And in this regard, we have a clear strategy that is delivery of 20%, 25%, 10% and in this regard, whenever there is an opportunity to gain market share domestically, we will do this."

We're actually encouraged by continued sort of year-on-year improvement in our M&A market share, where some of the investments are beginning to bear fruit. And that's particularly on an announced basis rather than a booked basis. If I look to the -- what we would estimate the market share to be in the fourth quarter based on the forward look of our pipeline and estimates of next quarter, we think we'll be back in the kind of 2.5, 2.6 range where we've been this year, and that's an encouraging step-up into next year."

If we take a step back, why is this still a topic? I mean by now, I would have expected the bank to be fully integrated, the IT to be merged. So when can we essentially stop talking about this and really see a step change in the cost on the Private Bank? And then my second question is on Private Credit, and this is becoming incrementally a topic. U.S. investment banks were talking a lot about this in Q3 results. And how do you approach Private Credit? Do you see it as a potential disruptor to some of your lending business? Do you see it as an opportunity to grow fee businesses by partnering? Yes, any comments on the Private Credit side? Thank you."

        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "Sure, Giulia, it's James. I'll take the both, and Christian, I want to add on the private credit side. Look, Postbank, the recovery from the operational disruptions that took place in last year's third quarter has taken us longer than we expected. Among other things, we were extremely focused on ensuring that we close out the backlogs of processes that were adversely affecting our clients. That was our focus. It was also the BaFin focus as they looked at the problem set. Hence, collections was an area that we waited longer to focus on improving. We've now made those investments, and we've hired the people, we've trained the people and that collections process is getting closer to normal. That took us longer than we expected this year, no question, which is why it's had the impact on the CLP guidance that it did. But given where we are right now and being up and running on that process, I think we feel much more comfortable that we're at the end rather than that there's still risk. The other thing is a little bit in the details, but the last model conversion of a portfolio from Postbank onto the DB systems and models on the risk side, that took place in the third quarter, that also influenced that number of \u20ac40 million. So why is it a topic? The sort of longer-term impact of the operational disruptions that is coming to an end as well as the models. On Private Credit, we see it more as an opportunity than as a threat. Obviously, there's a degree to which the banks face the risk of disintermediation. But I think that is -- that downside is more than offset by the upside of, frankly, a growing market, a growing ability to place risk in the marketplace and thereby increase our origination sort of business model, fees on origination and expand loan origination beyond what the capital on our balance sheet supports by itself. We also see opportunities sort of in collaboration with private credit firms to do more, collaboration with our own asset manager, DWS, to do more as DWS builds its strategies in Private Credit. So we aim to be here a participant not just as an originator, but also as a partner and a participant in managing private credit. So it is a change in the market. It is a disruption to some extent, but one that we're strategically we, at Deutsche Bank, feel we're actually well positioned on a relative basis globally and particularly in Europe, to be a beneficiary."

So in a sense, there is more opportunity to be serving customers in a leading way competitively in this marketplace in both brands now that we have the hard work behind us.

I'd say it's too early to tell on your question of is there anything sort of extraordinary that we may book in Q4. And the reason for that is in -- when I think about litigation, for example, what's in our control and not either analytically or in actual settlement activity is always hard to tell. But certainly, and I think we've been consistent in messaging on this, we want to put ourselves in a place where we no longer have surprises like the Postbank takeover litigation item for shareholders. Equally, we're in the planning process, restructuring and severance, we're still working towards our \u20ac400 million budget for the year, you'll see -- you've seen that Q4 -- actually, we did less than we expected in Q3, I'm sorry. And so there may be a bit of a catch-up in Q4. If there are additional tactical measures that we identify, we may go a little bit further there. Another area I might point out is real estate, we're always looking at our real estate portfolio and to see where we can optimize further. In all of those areas, too early to say what actions we could find to take place. But I think it's a signal of a company always looking for ways to optimize, improve our run rates and then deliver on promises -- in a sustainable way, by the way, deliver our promises for next year. On the CRE portfolio, it was approaching but not quite \u20ac1 billion that we put in the market. Of that, a little bit is sort of approaching 40% with Stage 3, and then the rest, a mix of performing in Stage 2. We were encouraged, frankly, by the pricing that we saw. Remember that when you're doing a portfolio sale, does it the \u20ac23 million we book, is it telling us our marks weren't right or simply that we're placing somebody else's cost of capital for our own? I think more of the latter. And given how close the marks on the Stage 3 are to on the Stage 3 elements are to our bookings, we see that as encouraging and further evidence of our view that the commercial real estate is at least found a floor and is stabilizing. That transaction, incidentally, I hope we were clear, but we have not closed on that transaction, but we have now booked to where we think it leads us in terms of marks. So that's overall encouraging. On the hedges, it's in both CB and IB, and a couple of those exposures they were shared across the two. We call them sort of concentration hedges. Well, we have a programmatic sort of policy to ensure that our concentrations don't exceed certain levels. When they do in terms of the underwriting, we sell those exposures away into typically CLO structures, sometimes other structures. The accounting has an asymmetry and produces revenue. Actually, net interest income was smaller this quarter, a little bit more in the first half. In total, over the course of the year, that's amounted to about \u20ac200 million. So only 30% of the losses actually sort of went to capital given the benefit of the hedging. I think it's a sign of the prudence that goes into that programmatic hedging that we do. And actually, going back to Giulia's question, it's an area where the growth of Private Credit is obviously helpful, because we see improvements both in capacity and pricing in the market into which we sell away the risk that we're talking about. I hope that all helps, Stefan."

So what we did was there was some what I think of as hedging of the convexity of the mortgage portfolio, which we historically had kept in treasury. This year, the decision was to push that out to the business where we think it appropriately belongs. And where -- by the way, one of the reasons to do that was the hedge programs that we're able to implement have improved. So that was the trigger for the change. And so that's meant that Private Bank on the surface has had a year-on-year comparison that's worse, both on revenues, by the way, and on costs than the -- I'll use the word, underlying performance would show. So it's been a noisy quarter for PB, but in areas that at least two of which are group neutral, either on the cost side with other segments or, in this case, on the revenue side with Corporate & Other."

        "speaker": "Jeremy Sigee",
        "text": "Hi, there, thank you. A couple of follow-ups. A lot has also been talked about. Firstly, on the U.S. CRE. I just wanted to check something that I think you implied, but your -- on Slide 37, you've shown the quarterly CLPs have now stepped back down to sort of \u20ac68 million. I think you're implying that that's the new run rate. We stay around that level going forward. I just wanted to make sure that I'm sort of understanding that right. And I guess it's a positive really that your modified loans are now \u20ac13 billion out of the \u20ac15 billion. So it sort of implies you work your way through the -- pretty much the whole portfolio, and I guess that supports that outlook. So first question is really just are we now expecting to go forward at that 68-ish run rate? And then the second question, I just wanted to press you a bit more on the M&A topic. You were commenting this morning on the Newswire, James, about Deutsche Bank positioned to play a leading role in European consolidation. The industrial logic makes sense, but you're just not ready right now. And I just wondered sort of how you view the scenario of someone like Commerzbank tying up with a different bank and effectively becoming unavailable, what remaining optionality would you have? Where else would you see opportunities for consolidation and for Deutsche Bank to play a leading role?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "So Jeremy, thanks for the questions. So more or less the answer is yes. We -- if we had printed in Q2 what we did in Q3, I think we would have been congratulated for the foresight. But we are absolutely seeing a trend here, and it's based on the items that we've talked about for a while. So relative stability in valuations, which you see in the loan to value. The interest rate environment. Obviously, the external indices that you've seen. And now having tested the market with the loan sale, also the results of that market check. As you also alluded to, inside the \u20ac68 million is \u20ac23 million that is -- and you could also think of it as bringing forward. And so the underlying run rate was even better. Look, I don't want to promise a number, I think having leaned out a little bit far in Q1 about Q2. But the direction of travel is there and all of the drivers that I referred to are there and visible. And as it relates to the modifications, you're correct. I mean, look, some of this portfolio will have been modified and then have its new maturity and come up for an extension a second time. So it's not impossible that it grows beyond the 15%, but it is -- just as a metric. But it is the case that we've been through the lion's share of the maturity profile and potential for modification. As we said last quarter, the list of projects where we see kind of scope for new defaults is obviously declining. So the number of loans where we see a risk in -- that there are modifications or default for the next 12 months, declining significantly. So all of those things to us are encouraging. Given you referred to my comments, I'll go quickly and Christian may want to add. I think our language on the strategic environment in Europe has been consistent throughout Deutsche Bank. I don't think it's a God-given right, but given the business that we do, our size, our home market and our sort of global capabilities, we think we are well positioned to be -- to play a leading role in time. We've also been consistently clear that we didn't see that time as having come. And that remains the case today. We've been consistent in our messaging that as we look to 2025, executing on our strategies delivering profitability, demonstrating its sustainability, demonstrating the growth, we'll do more for our shareholders considerably than anything that's inorganic. And so I think we -- I want to just emphasize the consistency of our language, but also over time, the ambitions we have for the organization, but it's all over time. One last note to just make -- to your question, our opportunity set changes, no question. If, in fact, the combination that is muted does take place. But it's one of a number of opportunities that one could consider. I don't want to be drawn on what those look like or when, but as you can imagine, we've given thought to the question you posed over the years."

        "text": "Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, when I look to fourth quarter guidance of the core businesses, I still seem to be coming out short relative to your \u20ac30 billion guidance, unless trading revenue is coming well over double digits and the same for O&A. So it feels like you expect the Corporate Center to continue to positively surprise, is that a fair assessment? And into next year, how does that -- how does the \u20ac500 million valuation timing differences, which we've seen year-to-date, feed into the revenue guidance for next year? And then secondly, it's been a whole [ph] based question, but does the general consensus that as long as rates stay between 2% to 3%, everything is fine. But if rates fall below 2%, it's a different story. So how would you see your interest rate sensitivity changing the further below 2% as we go? Thank you."

        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",

In Q4, I'd say, well, one thing that is not built into the guidance that we referred to is potential performance fees on the asset management side, which they are -- the way they are accounted for, they're not certain until the year is done and final. We do see, as you say, sequential growth in O&A, that's encouraging and that would help against the 7.1 that we're looking at for Q4. And if I just kind of walk forward the momentum we've had so far in FIC markets this year that should also produce, I think, a very solid quarter and contributed to the run rate. So we're encouraged there. Look, the corporate and other lines are hard to predict just by the nature. Valuation and timing, the nice thing this year really in the third quarter, remember, in the first quarter, we had some losses and valuation timing that were -- because of their short nature, actually, the pull to par happen very quickly. There is some longer-dated pull to par that we can already see going forward. It's not a big part of what we're planning for 2025. And overall, I'd say 2025 would probably be a reversal to some degree, from 2024. But it's always hard to predict what goes in those lines. They're very market dependent. I hope that helps kind of square the math."

        "text": "Yes. Look, it's always hard to predict. But as I've said to the question earlier, obviously, it would be -- we would like for our -- these roles to hedge -- to roll at 2% or more. To be fair, that's what the market expects in terms of a terminal rate in euros. Remember, though, that this is long-term rates. And so the scenarios of a steepening curve especially as you see less liquidity in the market, maybe higher fiscal deficits and other things, you could actually, in the long end, even in scenarios where the short goes down further see higher long-end rates. So it's not just the level, but also the shape of the curve. And what we look at this hard in treasury in our ALCO and ALM processes, how do we lock in as much of the future not just simply by rolling ten years, which is a big part of it for sure, but also by thinking about sort of option structures and other things that can protect specific sort of curve shapes over time. So I don't think it is -- don't think of it as totally linear in terms of our exposure to that environment."

Actually, what kind of investments which we have done over the last 18 months actually in the non-NII business. And exactly for that reason, in order to be really diversified from the revenue streams, that was the reason why we invested into Wealth Management, the fee business part of Corporate Bank and obviously, in the O&A business. So I do believe that even if this would come, that, A, I refer to James' comments, but also the strength of the bank in the non-NII business, which is clearly significantly improving."

But if you could just tell us whether there's any update to the Basel IV guidance. I think I had about \u20ac7.5 billion versus January 2025, and then another similar amount with FRTB at the beginning of 2026. And then if there's anything to update on the leverage finance reviews on the AVA technical draft, I think those are two other potential moving parts for next year that would be helpful. Thank you."

        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "Thanks, Piers. No, not much in the way of new news. It's still our estimate \u20ac15 billion in total split basically 50-50 is still about right. So next, the Q1 impact is operational risk related. Q1 2026 would be FRTB related. The OCI filter item that I talked about with Kian would also be a feature then whatever that number is in 2026. So those are the build items that are still left ahead of us. I think, as I say, there are also the possibility of things taking place that give benefits against that future. I mentioned the sectoral buffer against mortgages in Germany, considerably a delay in FRTB. So is the nature of the beast here is that it's a bit of a moving target. But with all of the things that we can see right now, we feel very comfortable in our path. On the leverage, well, the AVA item, which I take to be the question, so the EBA Q&A on additional valuation adjustments, I'm not aware of any real -- any sort of movement there. I know there was an exposure sort of draft, as I might call it, a lot of feedback for the industry, but there hasn't been a reissuance of that. We do, obviously, have very strong views about the ideas that were laid out in the EBA draft. That would be a headwind to our current expectations in capital plan, but we also think that those ideas were excessively conservative and would argue strongly around that. Was your question though, also more broadly about the leverage lending review with the ECB, there wasn't much really to update there either, I have to say."

        "text": "Good afternoon. Firstly, just a quick clarification. I think in the revenue walk from \u20ac30billion to \u20ac32 billion, you talked about \u20ac300 million to \u20ac400 million incremental NII in PB and CB from deposit growth. Can I just confirm that that's the case and that the \u20ac300 million from the structural hedge tailwind is then on top of that?"

        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "So Andrew, no. Just to be clear, we would expect, ballpark, \u20ac200 million in each of the larger deposit businesses next year and that ties to the disclosure around the hedges. That number is before any benefits of growth in the balance sheet, whether loans or deposits or spreads on either of those two things. So that's why, I think, in Christian's comments, we see upside in NII not just from the rollover, and let's say that's \u20ac300 million to \u20ac400 million depends a little bit still on the interest rate environment, but an incremental NII benefit next year from all those other factors. So I hope that clarifies."

So there's an unusual uplift from a 3-year dollar hedge -- U.S. dollar hedge that the Corporate Bank is benefiting from, that evens out the mix next year.

Now the scope for upside from conservative assumptions there naturally has diminished because we've sort of gone through the upswing and now the beginning of the downswing of the cycle. We're not seeing anything in terms of behavior today that would suggest more pressure on the banks in terms of pricing. And so that's encouraging. But as I say, the scope for over-earning at this point in the cycle is obviously less. I'm going to say in beta terms, single-digit percentages rather than double-digit percentages that we once had."

[Operator Instructions] The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast. At this time, it's my pleasure to turn over to an Ioana Patriniche, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2024 preliminary results call. As usual, our Chief Executive Officer, Christian Sewing, will speak first; followed by our Chief Financial Officer, James von Moltke. The presentation, as always, is available to download in the Investor Relations section of our website, db.com. Before we get started, let me just remind you the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which may not develop as we currently expect. We therefore ask you to take notice of the precaution rewarding at the end of our materials. And with that, let me hand over to Christian.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, Ioana, and a warm welcome from me. Before we discuss our preliminary 2024 financials in detail, I wanted to offer you my perspective on 2024. This was a vital transition year for us, which has seen us deliver crucial building blocks in the transformation of our business model. We have moved past a number of legacy items absorbing a series of nonoperating costs predominantly litigation matters, which have masked the underlying strength of our business. Our operating performance demonstrated execution against our plans as our pre-provision profit increased by 19% compared to 2023, if adjusted for certain specific items. Importantly, however we are now set for a clean and significantly more profitable year in 2025 with the foundation now build for further improvements in the years beyond. Let me spend a bit more time talking through this turnaround work, which has resulted in a fundamentally different bank in terms of earnings power in combination with a better risk profile and improved resilience all of which are visible in our 2024 financials. Let's start with the top line. First and foremost, we have successfully positioned all our businesses to perform by strengthening our market position, reinforcing our focus on clients and working with deep dedication as their Global Hausbank. Our business have clear momentum which is visible through our revenue delivery of over \u20ac30 billion, well above what we thought would be achievable when we first set our 2025 targets. And we are very pleased with the strong start of this year, which, again, demonstrates our clear franchise momentum. Second, on expenses, we delivered on our adjusted cost guidance of \u20ac5 billion each quarter when excluding the already guided exceptional items. We have continued to execute on our operational efficiency measures which gave us room to make critical investments into business growth, technology and controls while reducing redundancies in our cost base in line with our plan. We believe these investment decisions will strengthen our delivery in 2025 and beyond. Third, importantly, we continue to improve our risk profile in 2024, which did come at a cost of \u20ac1.7 billion across 3 specific litigation items. And while these items, of course, impacted our reported results, moving forward, our position to deliver returns is not only strengthened for 2025, but also for future years, particularly given the supportive market backdrop for our businesses. Looking ahead, as we have continued to make conscious investments into our franchise, coupled with stickier inflation, we now expect to end 2025 with a cost income ratio of below 65%. We know we need to continue to focus on cost management in the near and medium term and we have a clear management agenda to address this. Crucially, for this year, we expect to deliver strong positive operating leverage as we increased revenues by \u20ac2 billion year-on-year while keeping adjusted costs flat. Fourth, on distributions. We remain committed to capital returns. And today, we are announcing a \u20ac750 million share buyback program in addition to a dividend per share of $0.68 in respect of 2024, which we plan to propose for approval at our Annual General Meeting. Together, this represents a total of \u20ac2.1 billion of capital distributions announced so far this year. As we have said before, we want to maintain a prudent approach to capital management, and we will, of course, look to do more for our shareholders in line with our performance. Our strong CET1 ratio of 13.8% sets us up well for this heading into the rest of the year. And we remain committed to surpassing our total shareholder distribution target of \u20ac8 billion. To summarize, 2024 has not been easy, but it was an important year for us as we took important management actions to secure our trajectory and cement our path to a return on tangible equity above 10% for 2025. Beyond that, we have defined a clear management agenda for further developing our global house bank offering and sustainably increasing returns in 2025 and in the years thereafter. Let's now discuss each of these points in detail starting with our operating momentum on Slide 3. We increased 2024 pre-provision profit by 19% compared to 2023, if adjusted for 3 specific litigation items as well as the goodwill impairment in 2023. The specific litigation items in 2024 comprised the Postbank takeover litigation matter; elevated provisions for Polish FX mortgages; and the derecognition of the reimbursement asset for the Raschem Alliance litigation matter, which James will elaborate on further. Pre-provision profit remained broadly stable on a reported basis as our operating strength enabled us to absorb even large exceptional items. We have delivered sustained operating leverage of 5%. Excluding the specific litigation items in 2024 and the goodwill impairment in 2023. Growth was driven by both revenue momentum and cost discipline. Revenues grew by 4% year-on-year supported by our deep dedication and client engagement and around 75% came from more predictable revenue streams in Corporate Bank, Private Bank, Asset Management and FIC financing. A well-diversified revenue mix enabled us to grow through the interest rate cycle. Commissions and fee income increased by 13% year-on-year in line with our strategy and driven by our strategic investments. Net interest income in key banking book segments and other funding outperformed our prior guidance and remained broadly stable year-on-year. Adjusted costs decreased 1% year-on-year to \u20ac20.4 billion or 2% to \u20ac20.2 billion, excluding the preguided real estate measures and U.K. bank levy true-up in the fourth quarter. Excluding these items, we delivered 4 quarters of adjusted cost of around \u20ac5 billion, in line with our plans. We have made steady progress on our efficiency program. This offset conscious investments in the franchise and inflationary pressures. We have now completed measures we've delivered our expected gross savings of \u20ac1.85 billion, almost 3/4 of our \u20ac2.5 billion goal with around \u20ac1.67 billion in savings already realized. As part of this program, we have removed 3,500 roads, primarily reducing nonclient-facing roads, focus in high-cost locations, while recent hires have been focused on technology and controls as well as revenue-generating areas. Turning to Slide 4. Let us now look at the momentum we have created in each of our businesses against the goals set in 2022. At our Investor Day in March 2022, we set ambitious objectives for 2025. With 12 months to go, our business growth focused strategies are delivering strong results against these objectives. The corporate bank remains at the core of the Deutsche Bank franchise, and we have further enhanced its value proposition through a strengthening client franchise and investments in technology supported by our global network. As an example, incremental deals won with multinational clients have increased by around 40% since 2022. The division outperformed its revenue growth ambition despite normalizing interest rates and delivered a return on tangible equity of 13% in 2024, 3x its 2021 level. The Investment Bank is outperforming its revenue growth target and delivered an RoTE of 9% in 2024, cementing its position as a leading European investment bank. We are also particularly pleased we have outperformed the peer average for the full year as we continue to see our investments paying off. The business has demonstrated sustained revenue performance through the cycle since 2021 supported by further diversifying its income stream and increasing market share in origination and advisory by around 50 basis points in 2024. In fixed income and currencies, we have built strong market share and demonstrated sustained growth in financing, which is up 12% year-on-year in 2024 and we achieved significant year-on-year growth of over 60% in O&A in 2024 through considerable market share increases in a growing fee pool. Since 2021, the Private Bank created two distinct businesses to sharpen the commercial focus and to better serve clients' changing needs. We scaled up the Wealth Management franchise successfully turning around profitability in core markets while strengthening our #1 positioning in Germany. In Personal Banking, we have launched a major efficiency transformation with a decisive review of our service model and branch footprint optimization. The business continues to leverage its leading market position with net inflows of \u20ac29 billion, supporting noninterest revenue growth of 5% last year, in line with our strategy. Overall, the division grew revenues in line with targets since 2021. The business has made transformative efficiency gains since 2021, closing a further 125 branches in 2024, increasing the total to almost 400 closures since 2021, in addition to reducing full-time employees by a further 1,300 in 2024 alone. Looking at the fourth quarter more closely, adjusted costs were down 9%, reflecting delivery of savings despite ongoing inflationary pressures. Profitability and higher returns, especially in German Personal Banking, will remain top priorities, and we expect to deliver them by a further streamlining of our branch network and the modernization of both our brands while leveraging the synergies from our unified IT environment. In short, the Private Bank continues its path to sustainably transform the business, which we believe will translate into substantially better returns which would be visible this year and beyond. Asset Management, again, grew assets under management in 2024 by \u20ac115 billion and surpassed \u20ac1 trillion for the first time, boosted by net inflows of \u20ac42 billion into passive investments. Exceeding this mark shows the scale and competitiveness of our Asset Management division. Overall, the business demonstrated its strength and showed increased cost efficiency, leading to an RoTE of 18% in 2024. Driven by the benefits of higher AUM levels and revenue growth initiatives already in place, we expect the compound revenue growth rate in Asset Management to turn positive in 2025 and approach its original ambition. On Slide 5, let me now turn to the question why we feel confident in reaching our 2025 revenue growth ambitions. Since 2021, we have delivered a compound annual growth rate of 5.8%, in line with our upgraded target range. In 2025, we expect continued franchise momentum and our capital-light businesses to drive further growth supported by our investments, increasing the revenue CAGR to around 5.9%. We have a clear road map towards our 2025 target. In the Corporate Bank, we expect revenues to grow by around 5.5% or \u20ac400 million, largely from scaling of commissions and fee income predominantly in trade finance and fee-based institutional business and repricing of existing clients. resilient net interest income will provide further support. Investment Bank revenues are expected to grow by around 8% as we see encouraging trends in the market, good levels of corporate activity and confidence, solid financing conditions and pent-up private equity dry powder. The main growth driver is expected to be O&A with an increase in revenues of approximately \u20ac600 million, reflecting growth globally, but led by the U.S. We have positioned ourselves well to benefit from these trends and grow market share further, supported by our investments, reaching their full potential. We also expect FIC to show continued growth in 2025, driven by ongoing strength and further focused investments in financing. We will continue to develop our wider platform in both existing and adjacent businesses with a focus on the U.S. and flow credit. In the Private Bank, we expect revenue growth of around \u20ac400 million or about 4%, driven by higher NII from continued business volume growth and the deposit hedge rollover as well as growing noninterest income, harvesting benefits from higher assets under management and growth in investment solutions. Finally, we expect asset management to grow by around \u20ac300 million or 12.5%. We expect the business to benefit from the growth in assets under management during 2024 and a strong equity market development this year. which should boost management fees in 2025. We furthermore expect continued growth in passive, including extractors and in alternatives. These drivers underline our confidence in achieving our revenue goal of around \u20ac32 billion in 2025 before FX benefits. At year-end FX rates we expect this number to be around \u20ac32.8 billion. Importantly, all divisions are contributing to the substantial growth from both noninterest revenues and NII, which once again reflects our well-diversified business mix. Around 75% of this growth is expected to come from more predictable revenue streams. Let me now turn to costs on Slide 6. In 2025, our goal is simple: deliver a significant normalization of nonoperating costs and essentially flat adjusted costs despite our ongoing investments into growth. Moving past significantly elevated litigation and other restructuring charges in 2024. We are planning with a clear reduction of \u20ac2.1 billion in nonoperating costs this year. Turning to adjusted costs. Since we presented our ambitions for 2025 at our Investor Day in 2022, we have navigated dynamically through a volatile and fast-moving environment. And this resulted in some additional costs as we choose to make investments in technology controls and business growth and with inflation proving to be more persistent than anticipated. In respect of the additional investments, we have positioned the bank for sustainable growth in 2025 and beyond by investing into 2 key areas. Firstly, growing our franchise beyond our original revenue ambition to better serve our clients and deliver higher rewards for shareholders. Secondly, expanding our initially planned mandatory and strategic investments into technology controls and regulatory remediation. In 2024, we hired 1,300 technology specialists and added 400 targeted revenue-generating roads supporting long-term cost improvements and growth. In 2024 alone, we also invested a further \u20ac1.2 billion into controls, taking the total since 2019 to more than \u20ac6.5 billion. Some of these additional expenses will stay with us this year. However, we expect to offset much of the impact through our cost measures in line with our plan, which we expect to yield further benefits in 2025 and beyond. Our optimization initiatives in Germany are expected to generate savings of close to \u20ac200 million. Investments to reduce the complexity of our organization by improving technology and optimizing the workforce across infrastructure are expected to deliver a further \u20ac300 million. An automization of processes alongside better alignment of our front-to-back setup should deliver another \u20ac200 million. Our initiatives include the previously announced closure of additional branches in 2025. The implementation of new branch formats as well as decommissioning of further applications or moving them to the cloud. The net effect is that we expect to hold our adjusted cost base flat year-on-year while reducing nonoperating costs significantly. James will detail the year-on-year cost work later. This, combined with the anticipated revenue growth of \u20ac2 billion we just discussed will create substantial operating leverage. As a result, we now target a cost income ratio of below 65% this year, marginally higher than our original target, though this will further support growth and business momentum in and beyond 2025. As I said earlier, this does not compromise delivery of our greater than 10% RoTE target or our plans for capital distributions. Let me now turn to this, starting with the path to our return on tangible equity target on Slide 7. We remain on a clear path to achieve our RoTE target of above 10% and in 2025 driven by focused execution across all 3 delivery pillars of our global house bank strategy. As you saw, we have a business-by-business road map to grow revenues to around \u20ac32 billion in 2025, in line with our target growth of 5.5% to 6.5%. Operational efficiencies play a key role in keeping adjusted costs flat in 2025 and thereby reducing total noninterest expenses as nonoperating costs normalize. Capital efficiencies have delivered cumulative RWA equivalent reductions of \u20ac24 billion, close to our end 2025 goal of \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion. In the fourth quarter alone, we delivered \u20ac2 billion of RWA equivalent reductions driven by data and process improvements. We are confident we will reach the upper end of our target range by year-end 2025 through further securitizations and data and process improvements. Delivering on these pillars gives us a clear path to an RoTE about 10% in 2025. The nonrepeat of significant litigation items in 2024 gives us a starting point of an adjusted RoTE above 7%. Firstly, reaching around \u20ac32 billion revenue goal is expected to add more than 2 percentage points to our 2025 RoTE. Around 20% of this growth expected to come from an increase in net interest income by roughly \u20ac400 million, primarily due to the rollover of hedges. Another 40% or roughly \u20ac800 million should come from higher noninterest revenues from more predictable income streams, including from scaling actions and monetizing client relationships in the corporate bank or the spillover effect from higher AUM levels in asset management and private banks. The remaining revenue increase is expected to come primarily from market share expansion in a growing fee in O&A. From a regional perspective, we expect increasing revenues in the Americas, supported by an improving backdrop and reflected our targeted investments while further growth is expected to come from Asia and the Middle East as well as Germany. Secondly, we expect an additional contribution of around 50 basis points from the reduction in noninterest expenses we just discussed. Together, this would bring us already to our targeted RoTE level. And finally, we expect a contribution of around 40 basis points from the reduction of credit loss provisions in 2025 towards more normalized levels. in line with our guidance with our third quarter results. All in all, we see a clear path to achieving our RoTE target of above 10%. Let me now discuss the implications for capital distributions. The value we have created for our shareholders is visible in the growth intangible book value per share by more than 20% since 2021 to almost \u20ac30. This was driven by strong organic capital generation and greater capital efficiency which supported both rising shareholder distributions and business growth. We have received regulatory approval for a share buyback of \u20ac750 million. Additionally, and as guided, we plan to propose a dividend per share of $0.68 for 2024 at our upcoming Annual General Meeting in May, amounting to a distribution of around \u20ac1.3 billion. Together, these initiatives result in shareholder distributions of around \u20ac2.1 billion announced so far in 2025. The announced distributions in 2024 would bring cumulative capital return to around \u20ac5.4 billion since 2022, in line with our promise back in July 2019 when we announced our compete to win strategy. Looking ahead, our guidance for a dividend of \u20ac1 per share in respect of financial year 2025 would equal roughly \u20ac1.9 billion with that modest additional share buybacks this year or next year would be sufficient to get our \u20ac8 billion target. However, we are committed to surpassing this target as we have said before, and it remains our priority to reward our shareholders in line with our performance, and we are confident that we will continue to deliver rising distributions in the coming years. Before I hand over to James, let me give you a brief outlook on our next phase on Slide 9. With the end of 2024, the foundation of the Global Hausbank has been laid successfully. And as you heard, we are set to deliver the return target we have set ourselves for this year, supported by the momentum and operating strength of our franchise. And of course, the management team also looks beyond 2025 towards our longer-term ambitions, and we are committed to step up. We are already implementing measures today to elevate Deutsche Bank's performance beyond 2025, which will make us a more profitable bank. This focuses on client work, our own operations and the way we work and lead. In short, we want to be even more dedicated to our clients' needs while continuing to embed our clear purpose in our daily activities. This will drive further revenue growth. We are determined to make this bank more efficient, and that means changing how we do things. It starts with a simpler organizational setup and a smaller workforce and it requires to become even more technology-driven, which will also enhance client experience. We will put full focus on the productive allocation of capital to improve shareholder value and further balance out our earnings profile. In the end, we aim to become a much more profitable bank overall than our 2025 RoTE target. Our management agenda for 2025 and beyond focuses on 3 key points: Growing value generation; reengineering our target operating model; and stronger leadership. Firstly, we aim to further grow value generation for our shareholders by sharpening our focus on capital allocation and RWA optimization at both business and client level to boost returns. We see tremendous potential from further improving resource productivity across the portfolio via repricing and reallocating capital to high-return franchises supporting further revenue growth. We plan to drive higher resource productivity through capital light originations in line with our strategy and accelerated asset rotation. We aim to boost the profitability of lower-return business through front-to-back efficiency improvements and be disciplined in redeploying capital elsewhere, including making exits, if necessary. We have already started these reviews in some lending portfolios such as mortgages and are seeing benefits of these choices. Secondly, we plan to achieve the next phase of operational efficiencies beyond our \u20ac2.5 billion goal by reengineering our target operating model. Our clear ambition is to operate the bank with a lower head count, and we aim to run a much leaner platform as our investments in technology, automation and controls material. We are tackling inefficiencies by giving business leaders more control over their cost base, coupled with further front-to-end streamlining of processes. We plan to actively reduce management layers and roads and integrate teams as part of our workforce optimization initiatives, in particular, scrutinizing those areas where we do not see the required efficiency improvement. Thirdly, our management agenda emphasizes strengthening risk management and accountability and evolving our culture through a purpose-led framework, we call, this is Deutsche Bank. With our investments, we are well positioned to grow the Global Hausbank model make it more efficient and generate more capital for deployment in the business and shareholder distributions. Our management agenda provides significant scope to further improve our return profile and deliver sustainably growing earnings beyond 2025, unlocking the full potential of this bank. We will provide you with more details on our aspiration and actions beyond 2025 over the course of this year, but our immediate focus remains on demonstrating disciplined execution. With that, let me hand over to James.\nJames Von Moltke: Thank you, Christian, and good morning. As usual, let me start with a few key performance indicators on Slide 11. Notwithstanding the items in the fourth quarter that improve our risk profile, we maintained a level of resiliency we could not have shown a few years back, underscoring the successful transformation to date. Our capital position remained robust with the CET1 ratio at 13.8% at year-end despite absorbing the specific litigation items throughout the year and the capital deduction for the \u20ac750 million share buyback announced today. Our liquidity metrics remain sound. The liquidity coverage ratio was 131%, in line with our target and the net stable funding ratio was 121% at the upper end of our target range. Let me now turn to the fourth quarter highlights on Slide 12. Group revenues were \u20ac7.2 billion, up 8% on the prior year quarter. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac420 million, equivalent to 35 basis points of average loans, down \u20ac67 million year-on-year. Noninterest expenses were \u20ac6.2 billion, up 14%, reflecting exceptional nonoperating and adjusted cost items. Nonoperating items were \u20ac945 million in the quarter, including net litigation charges of \u20ac659 million and restructuring and severance charges of \u20ac286 million. Adjusted costs were \u20ac5.3 billion, including charges for optimizing the bank's own real estate footprint of \u20ac100 million as well as a true-up for bank levies in the U.K. of \u20ac134 million. And despite the exceptional cost items, we generated a profit before tax of \u20ac583 million and a net profit of \u20ac337 million. Our tax rate in the fourth quarter came in at 42%. And excluding the aforementioned litigation matters, the tax rate would have been 28%. We expect the 2025 full year tax rate to range between 28% and 29%. In the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.15, and tangible book value per share was \u20ac29.90, up 5% year-on-year. Let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results and start with a review of our net interest income on Slide 13. NII across key banking book segments and other funding was strong at \u20ac3.3 billion, up sequentially and broadly flat on the prior year quarter. Compared to the third quarter, slightly higher deposit volumes, in particular, overnight deposits offset the expected beta conversions in the corporate bank. Private Bank and was up sequentially as we guided before, and FIC financing continued to grow its loan portfolio with a corresponding increase in quarterly revenues. With that, let me turn to the full year NII trends and the outlook for 2025 on the next page. Given the stronger NII in the fourth quarter, we outperformed our prior 2024 full year guidance of \u20ac13.1 billion, reporting \u20ac13.3 billion across our key banking book segments and other funding. This is about \u20ac100 million higher than 2023, reflecting the resilience of our NII even during an environment of falling rates and beta convergence. For 2025, we expect NII yet again to increase to around \u20ac13.6 billion, a sequential increase of around \u20ac400 million. This is in line with our guidance provided last quarter but reflective of the outperformance in the fourth quarter. The key drivers of the rollover effect from our hedges supported by portfolio growth in the Private Bank, Corporate Bank and FIC financing. As a reminder, our hedge portfolio stabilizes our income by extending the tenor of interest rate risk, but it also protects us against a drop in interest rates. We provide further details in the appendix on Slide 38. Based on forward rates at the end of December, we expect the income from the hedge book to grow by several hundred million euros each year as we roll maturing hedges. In current rate conditions, we are more sensitive to the long-term rate development and are less sensitive to short-term movements in policy rates. Turning to Slide 15, Adjusted costs were \u20ac0.3 billion for the quarter. We have seen lower costs across all categories versus the prior year quarter and reduced adjusted costs, excluding bank levies by 2% or \u20ac118 million. Bank levies were driven by the true-up in the U.K. of \u20ac134 million. In line with our guidance in earlier quarters, we managed adjusted costs, excluding bank levies, closer to \u20ac4.9 billion if adjusted for \u20ac100 million from optimizing our own real estate footprint and the other unfavorable impact from exchange movements of around \u20ac60 million. We have included further details in the appendix on Slide 29. On a full year basis, adjusted costs, excluding bank levies, increased by around \u20ac100 million on a constant FX basis, as savings from streamlining our IT platform and lower spend for professional services were offset by higher costs for compensation and benefits, driven by rate growth, higher performance-related compensation and the impact from increased internal workforce. With that, let me turn to our cost guidance for 2025 on Slide 16. As Christian said earlier, a lot has happened since we embarked on our global house bank strategy in 2022. And while we have taken opportunities to not only create a more resilient franchise, but also to ensure that we are better positioned for sustainable growth, there have also been headwinds, which we have not been able to fully offset. Noninterest expenses in 2024 included a number of specific items, which are either nonrecurring in nature or aimed at improving our risk profile and supporting target delivery in 2025. total nonoperating costs were \u20ac2.6 billion, driven by litigation charges for 3 specific items, which amounted to \u20ac1.7 billion. Firstly, the Postbank takeover litigation matter had a full year net impact of \u20ac906 million, reflecting the initial provision and the settlement agreements we entered into in the third quarter. Secondly, the industry-wide FX mortgage matter in Poland resulted in additional provisions of \u20ac329 million in the fourth quarter to reflect our updated estimation of the impact of developments in the market. The total impact for the year was \u20ac500 million. And lastly, the RusChemAlliance Alliance litigation matter, which had an impact of \u20ac262 million in the fourth quarter and affected the corporate bank. Recent developments led to the derecognition of a reimbursement asset as a recovery of the claim through an indemnification obligation could no longer be assessed as virtually certain. However, we believe we are in possession of a valid reimbursement claim and will vigorously assert our position. Other litigation charges of \u20ac366 million were broad-based across a number of smaller items. Additionally, restructuring and severance charges were elevated in the year at around \u20ac530 million, slightly higher than the \u20ac400 million we initially expected for the year and included additional actions taken during the fourth quarter. We made further progress, particularly in the Private Bank to support our strategic transformation, which is aimed at rationalizing our branch footprint in Germany, while improving the access to advisory solutions for our retail clients. Assuming a normalization of overall nonoperating costs, the noninterest expense step off for 2025 would have been \u20ac20.9 billion. For 2025, we expect overall adjusted costs to remain flat year-on-year at around \u20ac20.3 billion, which translates to around \u20ac20.7 billion at year-end FX rates. This is higher relative to our prior guidance, mainly driven by additional investments and business growth opportunities that we identified during our last planning cycle. These investments, particularly into our Corporate Bank and Investment Bank businesses, support our targeted revenue growth this year and position us for further growth beyond. We also see continued demand for control and remediation investments to ensure the bank fulfills all of its regulatory obligations and expectations. In line with our original target, nonoperating costs are expected to materially reduce to around \u20ac400 million in 2025 as litigation and restructuring and severance charges normalize. As a result, noninterest expenses in 2025 are expected to be around \u20ac20.8 billion, resulting in a full year cost-income ratio of below 65%, but delivering a significant implied operating leverage of 16%. The investments leading to a higher cost base will also support toward further operating leverage beyond 2025. In short, although the reported numbers for 2024 are higher than originally planned, Christian and I are encouraged regarding our trajectory going into 2025. Let us now turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 17. In line with the guidance provided in October, full year provisions stood at \u20ac1.8 billion, equivalent to 38 basis points of average loans. Provisions were impacted by specific headwinds, including transitional effects from the Postbank integration, which continue to taper off; two relatively fast-paced larger corporate events impacting provisions at a level unusual compared to historical standards and which were materially hedged as well as a cyclically higher level of commercial real estate provisions, which we expect to decrease on a full year basis in 2025. You will find the full year update on transitory headwinds on Slide 42 of the appendix. When looking at the fourth quarter, provision for credit losses was \u20ac420 million or 35 basis points of average loans. As guided, the sequential decrease in provisions of \u20ac74 million was due to a reduction of Stage 3 provisions as the Corporate Bank benefited from a larger recovery on a legacy workout situation. Investment Bank provisions were lower, benefiting from a further small reduction of provisioning levels in CRE. During the fourth quarter, the bank completed the loan portfolio sale in the U.S. Stage 3 provisions decreased sequentially to \u20ac415 million. Provisions were mainly driven by the Private Bank, which included impact from a small number of legacy cases in Wealth Management as well as the investment bank where CRE remained the main driver. Stage 1 and 2 provisions were negligible as various portfolio effects were offset by slightly improved macroeconomic forecasts and overall recalibrations -- overlay recalibrations in the fourth quarter. Before we move on, a few remarks on asset quality. We maintained tight underwriting standards and continue to conservatively manage our loan book, including single-name concentration risks through comprehensive hedging programs with a total notional volume of hedges standing at \u20ac42 billion. Our regular and comprehensive portfolio reviews show that overall credit quality remains stable and forward-looking indicators such as rating migration and trends in our noninvestment-grade portfolio as well as watch list ratios do not suggest a noteworthy deterioration in asset quality. We also see broadly stable developments in our domestic market as outlined on Slide 45 of the appendix, and we are carefully monitoring the developments surrounding it. With that, let me turn to capital on Slide 18. Our fourth quarter common equity Tier 1 ratio came in at 13.8%. CET1 capital decreased primarily reflecting the deduction of the \u20ac750 million share buyback from excess capital. As expected, market risk RWA decreased driven by SBAR and incremental risk charge from careful positioning into year-end. The marginal increase in credit risk was driven by model changes, largely offset by reductions from capital efficiency measures. With respect to the CRR3 go-live effective January 1, 2025, our pro forma CET1 ratio was 13.9%, around 5 basis points above our ratio for year-end 2024. However, the CRR3 go-live will also lead to around \u20ac5 billion of RWA equivalent impact from operational risk to come in the first quarter. Hence, the total impact of CRR3 is a CET1 ratio burden of around 15 basis points, consistent with prior guidance. At the end of the fourth quarter, our leverage ratio stood at 4.6%, flat sequentially as the benefit from additional Tier 1 capital issuance in the quarter was offset by the CET1 deduction for the \u20ac750 million share buyback announced today and FX effects. With regard to bail-in ratios, we continue to operate with significant buffers over all requirements. In short, our capital position remains strong and already reflects our approved share buyback. And with that, let us turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 20. Corporate Bank revenues in the fourth quarter were \u20ac1.9 billion, 1% higher sequentially driven by growth in deposit revenues from interest hedging and higher volumes offsetting ongoing margin normalization. In 2024, we have made good progress on our growth initiatives to offset the normalization of deposit revenues by further accelerating noninterest revenue growth with 5% growth in commissions and fee income across all regions and a particularly strong contribution from our trade finance business. The deposit base remains strong throughout the entire year as deposits increased by \u20ac23 billion year-on-year, driven by higher site deposits in corporate treasury services and favorable FX movements. Provision for credit losses stood at \u20ac23 million, significantly lower driven by a larger recovery. Noninterest expenses were higher, driven by the RusChemAlliance Alliance litigation matter while adjusted costs decreased by 6% year-on-year, driven by lower direct costs and internal service cost allocations. This resulted in a post-tax return on tangible equity of 7.1% and a cost income ratio of 81%. I will now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 21. Revenues for the fourth quarter were 30% higher year-on-year on a reported basis with strong growth across the franchise. Revenues in fixed income and currencies increased by 26% with year-on-year improvements across all businesses. This represented the highest fourth quarter revenues on record. Financing revenues were significantly higher, reflecting strong fee income across the business, combined with an increased carry profile. Rates revenues were significantly higher, while its credit trading, foreign exchange and emerging markets increased benefiting from heightened market activity and client engagement. Moving to Origination & Advisory, revenues were significantly higher both year-on-year and sequentially with market share gains across business lines in a growing industry field fee pool. Advisory revenues were significantly higher, reflecting material market share gains year-on-year in a static industry fee pool. Debt origination revenues also increased and reflected strength in leverage debt driven by strong pipeline execution in an active market. Noninterest expenses were lower year-on-year due to the nonrepeat of a goodwill impairment in the prior year quarter. Adjusted costs were essentially flat when excluding the increase in U.K. bank levies mentioned earlier. Loan balances increased compared to the prior year, driven by the impact of FX translation, combined with growth in financing. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac101 million or 37 basis points of average loans significantly lower year-on-year due to the non-repeat of Stage 1 and 2 model-related provisions in the prior year, while Stage 3 provisions also decreased. Let me now turn to Private Bank on Slide 22. The Private Bank is making progress both in creating revenue momentum and putting transformation-related costs and transitory credit costs behind us. Revenues of \u20ac2.4 billion in the quarter reflect noninterest revenue growth of 6% year-on-year on the back of higher investment product revenues. NII declined by 5% driven by continued higher funding costs from the impact of minimum reserves, the group neutral impact of certain hedging costs as well as a benefit from episodic lending revenues in the prior year quarter. Excluding these effects, fourth quarter revenues in the Private Bank would have been up 6% year-on-year. Personal Banking revenues were impacted by aforementioned higher funding allocations and hedging costs, partially offset by higher deposit revenues. Wealth Management and Private Banking revenues were essentially flat as higher investment product revenues and lending growth was offset by the nonrecurrence of episodic lending revenues in the prior year. The business attracted net inflows into assets under management of \u20ac2 billion, supported by deposit campaigns in Germany. Outflows in investment products were mainly driven by specific and isolated client transactions. As outlined in the third quarter, we see cost savings coming through as the Private Bank continues its transformation with a further 74 branch closures in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to 125 this year and accelerated head count reductions of more than 1,300 FTE in the past 12 months, mainly in Germany. The substantial improvement in adjusted cost of 9% reflects the benefits from transformation initiatives and lower regulatory as well as client service remediation costs, which are now effectively behind us. Noninterest expenses declined by 5% year-on-year despite higher restructuring and severance costs. Provision for credit losses reflects continued workout activities on a small number of legacy cases in wealth management, while transitory effects from operational backlog are taping off as expected. The overall quality of our domestic and international loan portfolios remains solid. Let me now turn to Asset Management on Slide 23, which reached a key milestone during the fourth quarter by surpassing \u20ac1 trillion of assets under management for the first time. Scale is becoming increasingly important in this industry and for the DWS franchise, favorable market trends support our strategic positioning, especially given our strong position in passive products. And a usual reminder, the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Profit before tax more than doubled from the prior year period, driven by higher revenues. Revenues increased by 22% versus the prior year. This was primarily from higher management fees of \u20ac647 million from both active and passive products driven by growth in average assets under management. Additionally, performance fees more than doubled from the prior year period, primarily due to the recognition of a substantial multi-asset performance fee. Other revenues principally reflected a negative revaluation of the fair value of guarantees and lower investment income, partly offset by lower treasury funding costs. Noninterest expenses and adjusted costs were both essentially flat compared to the prior year. Passive products continued their strong performance driven by X-trackers with a further \u20ac14 billion in the quarter, contributing to \u20ac42 billion of net inflows for the year. Cash alternatives, quantitative solutions and multi-asset also achieved good results with combined net inflows of \u20ac6 billion more than offsetting net outflows in active equity and fixed income products. Assets under management increased by \u20ac49 billion in the quarter, driven by positive FX effects and net inflows. The cost-income ratio for the quarter declined to 67% and return on tangible equity was 21%, both improving from the prior year quarter. This morning, DWS communicated its outlook for 2025 and introduced new medium-term strategic targets, including 10% earnings per share growth per year from the starting point in 2025 to 2027. For further details, please have a look at the DWS disclosure on their Investor Relations website. Moving to Corporate & Other on Slide 24. Corporate & Other reported a pretax loss of \u20ac621 million this quarter, driven by the provision increase for foreign currency mortgages of \u20ac329 million, resulting from updates to the provision model parameters to reflect impacts of recent developments in the estimated cost of the legal risk. This compares to a pretax profit of \u20ac104 million in the prior year quarter, which included a provision release of \u20ac287 million relating to legacy litigation matters. Revenues were negative \u20ac99 million this quarter, primarily driven by retained funding and liquidity impacts. This compares to negative \u20ac64 million in the prior year quarter, with the decrease driven by valuation and timing differences, which were positive \u20ac87 million in the quarter compared to positive \u20ac143 million in the prior year quarter. Pretax losses associated with legacy portfolios primarily reflect the aforementioned litigation matters. At the end of the fourth quarter, risk-weighted assets stood at \u20ac34 billion, including \u20ac13 billion of operational risk RWA. In aggregate, RWAs have reduced by \u20ac6 billion since the prior year quarter mainly reflect a change in the allocation of operational risk RWA. Leverage exposure was \u20ac38 billion at the end of the quarter, slightly lower than the prior year quarter. For 2025, we expect a significantly lower pretax loss for Corporate & Other of approximately \u20ac200 million per quarter or \u20ac800 million for the full year, mainly reflecting the nonrecurrence of legacy litigation matters. As usual, this includes some uncertainty, particularly associated with the valuation and timing differences. Finally, let me turn to the group outlook on Slide 25. We believe we are on track to deliver increased revenues of \u20ac2 billion to achieve this year's revenue growth of around \u20ac32 billion, which translates to around \u20ac32.8 billion at year-end FX rates. We remain committed to rigorous cost management and we'll manage our cost base to a cost income ratio of below 65% for 2025. Although this is higher than the level we were previously aiming for, we feel good that the level of investment in 2025 positions us for incremental opportunities and higher returns over time while also further improving our control environment. We continue to expect an amelioration of provision for credit losses in 2025 as the transitory headwinds we called out previously subside. This should result in a reduction to around \u20ac350 million to \u20ac400 million of average quarterly provisions with further normalization expected in the following years. Our strong capital position gives us a solid step off for our 2025 and 2026 distribution of [audio gap]. We remain committed to our capital distribution target. The \u20ac750 million share buyback announced today and the dividend of $0.68 per share, which we plan to propose at our Annual General Meeting, brings us to \u20ac2.1 billion of capital distributions so far this year. Our full attention remains on delivering an RoTE of above 10% in 2025 driven by continued revenue momentum, cost control and balance sheet efficiency. And these are the levers to also deliver further improved profitability beyond 2025. With that, let me hand back to Ioana, and we look forward to your questions.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you, James. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Nicolas Payen from Kepler Cheuvreux.\nNicolas Payen: I have two questions, please. The first one would be on revenues. And could you elaborate on the bridge to \u20ac32 billion of revenue target, please? And in particular, what gives you confidence that you can reach \u20ac32 billion and how the start of the year position you towards these targets? The second question will be on share buyback. You previously alluded to a share buyback annual growth of roughly 50%, which would put you at \u20ac1 billion share buyback versus the 750 that you announced. So the question is, can we expect more throughout the years and at what point in time during this year? And also, what are the performance criteria that you're looking at to potentially announce more?\nChristian Sewing: It's Christian. Let me start with your questions, and then James can obviously contribute. Look, what makes us confident is, first of all, the overall positioning and foundation, which we have built over the last 4 or 5 years as a Global Hausbank to our clients, the momentum -- the development in all 4 businesses, feedback from clients. To be honest, in all the last 3 or 4 years, we not only met our revenue targets, but even exceeded that in the years really makes me confident that from the offering we have from the positioning we have is actually the right starting point also for the next years. And that feedback, Nicolas, we get continuously back from our clients, be it institutional clients, corporate clients and private clients. And let me also say that, in particular, the geopolitical items which we are facing in this world, in this regard, to be honest, support us, people want our advice. Corporates talk to us on their amended networks. So the mandates we get from the corporate side, from the institutional side, is, again, something which really makes me confident and is on a level which we haven't seen before. Now to the bridge from \u20ac30.1 billion, to be honest, to \u20ac32 billion. What makes me confident and how do we see that? I would really kind of divide that in three parts: Number one, it's \u20ac400 million coming from NII, and that is obviously reflecting the hedging which we have already put in place. This will, in particular, come from the PV and the CV side. And on top of that, we see also the growth in our fixed financing. So that is approximately \u20ac400 million, which we will see also the good work which we have done on the treasury side with our business. So that is locked in. Now the next thing is, and we always talk about, so to say, the more predictable business we see approximately \u20ac800 million, if not even a bit more, from the more predictable business. And that, in particular, is the Private Bank, Asset Management and the Corporate Bank. Now in those, you have approximately \u20ac400 million from the Corporate Bank. That, again, comes from active repricing monetizing our existing clients, scaling the business which we have invested in. If you look into our investment, which we have done in '23 -- in '24, but in particular, looking at the investment plan for '25, a high degree and partially the highest amounts in those years and in particular, in 25% goes into the Corporate Bank to really scale up our offering. And you have seen the overall development of the corporate bank, which is at the core of our franchise. And therefore, I can see at least this \u20ac400 million of uptick in the year 2025. And again, if I look at the mandates, which we are constantly winning how the year started, I'm very optimistic here. The other \u20ac400 million is in particular coming from the PB and asset management side. And here, a lot of prework has been done. I think in the prepared remarks, we talked about the growth in the assets under management on both sides, the private bank and the asset management side. So obviously, with the fees generated out of that, we will see higher returns. There is no drag on the NII side. I talked about the initial \u20ac400 million. So therefore, we can clearly see with the increased volume, higher revenues. Last but not least, I also said that in the discussions before, which we had on a quarterly side, there is a lot of momentum also in Germany, actually in the retail bank I think Germany, one of the biggest problems and challenges we have is actually with our pension plans in the next years. And more and more, this is -- these are the discussions, which we have with our clients. And again, then applying that to 15 million Postbank clients now being on our IT platform is a huge opportunity for us and [indiscernible] is banking on that. That brings us those \u20ac2 billion to \u20ac1.2 billion. So you are kind of at \u20ac31.2 million, \u20ac31.3 billion. Where is the rest coming from? \u20ac500 milion to \u20ac600 million, in particular, in the Investment Bank from the O&A business. I think James and I talked a lot about that over the last 18 months. We did on purpose the investments in the middle of 2023, not only Numis, but in particular, also the hirings of senior directors in the Corporate Finance business. I think we could show with the growth rates in 2024 that this started to pay off. I'm really proud what [indiscernible] has done in that business. Look at the Q4 numbers in the O&A business. We clearly outperformed the market. And I can see that this momentum is going on. So we believe that actually in the O&A market, we can increase our market share by approximately 50 basis points to approximately 3 percentage points. And then I also do believe that actually the fee pool, in particular, given what is happening in this world with the growth momentum we see in the U.S. will be higher next year. But the real impact the majority of the \u20ac500 million to \u20ac600 million is clearly coming from now that the investments are fully paying off and that we increase our market share. Now that already brings us almost very close to the \u20ac32 billion. I haven't talked about the FIC business because, obviously, in particular, [indiscernible] is not standing still. We have done significant investments, in particular, in Latin America, but also North America in our business. watch the credit trading business, also with the recent hires, which we have done summer last year and obviously, which we are paying off more and more. And therefore, I do believe that we have also a chance to grow there. So in this regard, that is the bridge for us from \u20ac30 million to \u20ac32 billion. Obviously, the confidence level, which James and I have and Fabrizio and Claudio is also sparked by a first good month. Now we know we cannot rest here, 1 month is 1 month. But the overall momentum in this bank to drive this, the feedback from the clients also last week in Davos is clearly telling me this is achievable, and I'm sure we can show you that already at the end of April. Second part on the share buybacks. Look, I do believe that James and I have also -- have always managed this bank in a prudent and conservative way, i.e., in particular, to your question, \u20ac1 billion to \u20ac750 million. First of all, I'm really happy with the starting point in which we start into this measurement here of 2025, 13.8% capital ratio gives us actually the ammunition, on the one hand, to grow business and have the right resources. That's all in our plans. But at the same time, obviously, also reward our shareholders. With the \u20ac750 million, which we announced and we should not forget that the 50% increase in dividends, we actually announced to the market already a distribution of \u20ac2.1 billion for this year. I think it's a wonderful starting point. And actually, if you move that up, we are now at \u20ac5.4 billion. If we think about our past, which we gave to the market in particular with regard to growing our distribution and also the dividends and you apply the next increase on the dividends for next year, you are already very, very close to the \u20ac8 billion. Now I think -- and that's what our approach is. Let us deliver on our business execution in the next month to deliver the 10% return on equity. Of course, we will review our distributions in the course of the year on the basis of our performance as, at the end of the day, we know that we also want to reward the shareholders, but I think it's a good and prudent start into the year. And let me end also with one thing, absolute confidence that we will do that what we promised to you to distribute more than \u20ac8 billion in the years '21 to '25, including the payouts in '26.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Anke Reingen from RBC.\nAnke Reingen: I just wanted to ask about the costs. Can you please talk a bit more about the increase in your guidance of the adjusted costs to \u20ac20.3 billion. I mean how much of this is a function of your revenue expectations in 2025? And how much is this reflecting future investments? And then on the -- how should we think about it at the divisional level on how the higher cost base comes through in terms of -- also in terms of the cost-income ratio target and in comparison, you previously provided cost-income ratio target at your previous Capital Markets Day. And then just the 62.5, is that now a target that's not in reach? Or does it remain a longer aspiration, something you might potentially discuss in the course of the year. And then last question, I mean, obviously, this is a bit of a disappointment on the Q4 performance. What should give us the confidence that Q4 2025 doesn't give us a similar disappointment. And then that aspect, I think the nonoperating costs at the \u20ac400 million looks relatively low. So if you can give us a bit more confidence that really the costs, I mean ignoring FX effects you will be able to deliver them.\nJames Von Moltke: It's James here. A lot to talk about, but all the right questions on the cost side for sure. So let me go in a little bit of a mixed order. On the nonoperating costs, look, start with restructuring and severance. We have a significant amount sort of I don't know practically all, but we've come such a long way in terms of the transformation of the company that there is not a great deal left to do, and we control that number. When I say not a great deal, there's still some work that Claudio and his team are doing on the private bank, you've seen that. But of course, we've taken some into Q4 to enable us to take some actions already in 2025. But for practical purposes, we're through the major transformation of the company. On the litigation side, the way I think about it is that there's a funnel of matters that can result in outflows in any given period of time. And that funnel is simply emptied. Now not in the right way. Obviously, in 2024, we had some surprises and there can always be unknown unknowns. But of the known items, the funnel is simply empty or [indiscernible] empty and the risks that we can see are remote, both in terms of time and likelihood. So we feel really good about the trajectory now on the normalization of nonoperating costs, and that counts -- that goes for Q4 next year. Obviously, we're -- we have every incentive not to deliver another quarter in which there's a kind of a messy Q4 -- another year in which there's a messy Q4. If I go to the Investor Day numbers, and this goes all the way back to 2022. But there actually, I see really good progress. So if I look to the business sort of plans for this year or the business cost income ratios in our plan, really encouraging progress. Now these weren't formal targets, but definitely a guide for you. And we see the -- both Corporate Bank and Investment Bank within the range. Corporate Bank may be towards the high end of the range, Investment Bank towards the middle of the range and asset management also very, very close to the top end of the range. So really good progress in those businesses. The Private Bank at this point will clearly be above the range. But actually, the underlying performance of the Private Bank is very encouraging in absolute terms are coming in very close to what we had factored in at the time. But there carrying the burden of really two things that some of where the incremental investment of controls and technology has gone in the years. And also as we've refined our internal cost allocations, you remember we've talked about driver-based cost management, it's tended to be shifted some of the expenses to the Private Bank. So overall, we're encouraged by what we see and there's still work to do. We don't think the trajectory for the businesses or the group ends with 2025. That gets me to your second -- to your third question, sorry. No, we're not cashiering the 62.5 forever. We think that the operating leverage that we've built and will continue to see in the company will take the cost income ratio further down in the years to come. And so we absolutely think that, that is within reach of the firm, but not in 2025. And so that then gets you to what has driven the costs up to the -- our current view of 20.3 on the old FX. Look, it's a bunch of drivers. And again, cumulatively, since the last Capital Markets Day, I would probably bucket as 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. It's sort of \u20ac600 million or \u20ac700 million over that time, if you express it in cost/income ratio terms and about 1/3 has gone into business investments, about 1/3 into control and the further 1/3 into technology, if I give you rough rough numbers, probably a little bit more weighted towards technology in that math. Now you've seen us make those decisions. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we think they are the right decisions for the company. Controls are the license to operate. And back in '22, we relatively quickly recognized we needed more investment to close out the control improvements to meet our own expectations and those of the regulators and that investment has continued. On technology, that's been sustained over the past several years. And as you know, our business very much competes on the technology that you can provide across a whole range of activities, including the client experience. And we think it's the right decision, therefore, to continue and sustain that investment. On the business side, this really goes back to the 2023 investment opportunity we saw particularly in the investment bank at the time. And we like how that investment is paying off and will pay off in the years to come. And so it's, if you like, the cumulative impact of those things that have carried into the costs for this year, if you're in the deep detail of why now and what wasn't visible to us last year, look, as we went through a planning cycle I would say, in addition to all of the above, inflation has run maybe $100 million in express just in '25 terms, higher than we might have have expected at the time. And as I say, so cumulatively, those are the drivers that have driven us to where we are now. Again, a lot of that has been offset by the very good work we've been doing under Rebecca's leadership on the efficiency program. And as Christian mentioned in his remarks, we've made enormous progress towards the \u20ac2.5 billion goal in terms of cost takeout, and there is more to come thereafter because I said in the last call, it's like peeling an onion, we see more opportunity as we get deeper into the transformation and deeper into some of the process improvements that we make.\nChristian Sewing: Sorry, Anke, just -- I mean, 100% support, what James is saying. Just to reiterate that, obviously, below 65 is not our endpoint. And for that, I simply also wanted to refer to Page 9 of our prepared remarks where, obviously, we are now thinking with all the investments we have done, what the outcome is. That goes beyond the \u20ac2.5 billion, which Rebecca is managing. But also here on purpose, obviously, we gave you a little bit of an outlook. So clear dedication and goal by the bank to go lower.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan.\nKian Abouhossein: I just wanted to come back to the cost line. So we should really look at \u20ac21.2 billion, I would say, is more realistic number. And in that context, can you just tell us what it also means in terms of revenues impact? Is it around I guess, \u20ac400 million roughly as well or slightly more, I assume? And in that context, can you talk a little bit about your ambition in Mittelstand? And if you have factored anything for expansion Mittelstand considering this clearly some opportunities in Germany with 2 banks potentially targets in terms of Mittlestand growth from your perspective? And can you talk about what you're actually doing on the ground to grow there? Lastly, within cost and apologies it's clearly a big topic, flexibility on cost of asset before, but clearly, there's a higher cost guidance, that's a topic that we get a lot of questions on. If you can talk about flexibility in case you don't get the \u20ac32 billion plus. And if I may just ask on last question on Page 9, on your return on, I guess, risk-weighted assets by business where you give kind of the profit to risk weighted assets, very interesting chart, clearly. And I'm just trying to understand what are the big buckets which we should look at in terms of underperforming businesses, so we understand what the opportunity is.\nJames Von Moltke: Great questions again, lots to go through there. Let me start on the easy stuff, and I'll give the harder questions. The FX impact, you're absolutely right to draw attention to it because what we wanted to do in our presentation was give you numbers that are consistent with what we've talked about for the past year. And hence, the presentation is largely -- is presented in what we would call plan FX levels, where euro-dollar was around [indiscernible]. And then we give you the translation into December FX, which was about [indiscernible]. And so that difference and creates on the revenue side, a number where $2 billion translates to about \u20ac32.8 billion. And on the expense side, as you say, 20.8 translates to 21.2. In the relationship between euros and dollars, dollar strengthening actually helps our margin just a little bit. And here, I refer to you to the currency breakout of revenues, expenses on Page 36, where you can see that there's a little bit of asymmetry in dollar euro, where we have more revenues than expenses expressed in dollars, and that drives, therefore, just a little bit of FX improvement on the margin. Now that relationship will change over the course of the year. So we'll continue to give you reporting that shows the year-on-year variances created by FX. One of the reasons we're talking about absolute numbers is always challenging given that change. And just to complete the picture, in case the question comes up, we do hedge the sterling risk. You'll see that there's also an asymmetry in sterling. We hedge that forward. It's rolling, so it's not forever. But the euro-sterling currency differences don't really change the in-year number is a great deal. Kian, you had a follow-up?\nKian Abouhossein: No, I'm fine.\nChristian Sewing: Looking on the Mittelstand [ph] Germany -- sorry, I was on mute. On the Mittelstand, Germany, a very good question. Look, there are 3 or 4 areas where we are obviously enhancing our business and also making sure that our portfolio with the Mittelstand not only growing, but the profitability of the portfolio, like indicated by the way, on Page 9 is further improving. Number one, we are going through this portfolio also from an SBA point of view. Clearly, one where we can do better, where we have done already action. And in particular, here, where our underlying process, which is also part of Page 9, i.e., how do we set up this bank front-to-back processes in the lending business making sure that we don't have different processes for the various financing or payment flows that we are streamlining this. This is one area where actually a lot of investments of the Corporate Bank going into the setup into the platform and the streamlining the German setup. So it will add just from an efficiency point of view, we will see a very positive impact there. Number two, of course, with the focus on the corporate bank in 2019, we also -- and I can say that here also with a little bit of pride, we absolutely regain credibility and trust in the German home market. And if I look at our market shares in not only obviously the DUCs company, but in the Mittelstand, be it the bigger family-owned companies, the Mittelstand itself, but also in the small business areas, we have actually gained momentum. We increased the revenues because the clients are feeling that Deutsche Bank wants to do that business. That was different before 2018. And with the constant improvements also process-wise, we obviously succeed. Thirdly, we have invested into our coverage. For Germany, if you want to really bank it in the best way, you need to be regionally. We have invested into our people here in order to make sure with the right coverage. And fourthly, yes, you alluded to that. Now obviously, I'm not talking in detail about that, but each situation in the industry is providing a huge opportunity. There is uncertainty in the market, you know what I'm talking about. And that obviously is a chance and opportunity for us, and we have started to work on this, and I'm sure more to come. So Mittelstand, Germany, is from a profitability point of view, efficiency point of view and from a growth, absolutely a focus. And let me also say, because I'm sure I'll get the next question, but we are not doing that at any price. We also need to take into account the situation, the economy. And therefore, we will not alter our underwriting standards because that would bite us and therefore, we keep the underwriting standards which we had. But doing this, we can see a clear growth here at home.\nJames Von Moltke: Kian, maybe just very briefly on you're pointing to Slide 9, the chart on the right. It's what we can now work with over the next several years in a more fine-tuned way than previously, with each of the businesses looking at the drivers of their SBA or profitability against the resources that they deploy. It means we can grow revenues through things like repricing and just business growth. We can manage the expenses down, leveraging some of the tools we've built over the years, including driver-based cost management. And we can also work with the businesses to reduce the capital burden and there the efforts we've gone to create resources efficiency on the RWA side is also helping. To give you an example of where we are using these tools to make decisions, we talked about the mortgage product and especially in our home market and the deemphasis over the past couple of years of that product. It's part because at various prices, the product didn't meet its hurdles. Middle market lending equally in Germany is something we need to improve the profitability of, as Christian says, it's strategically critical. It needs to sort of carry itself from a profitability perspective as well. There are other portfolios all around the company that we're working with the businesses very closely on. And the level of engagement in this work is extremely high, which is -- which gives us a lot of optimism about how these levers can be pulled over the next several years to drive a very significant impact in bringing each of the units up and also the average.\nOperator: The next question comes from Flora Bocahut from Barclays.\nFlora Bocahut: The first question I wanted to ask is actually a clarification, regarding the buyback, the \u20ac750 million that you announced today, just to understand when you intend to launch that buyback. Are we talking just a few days? Or are we talking several months before this gets launched? And then on the questions, first is actually coming back to the CET1 trajectory and distribution plans. And thank you, Christian, for clarifying how the performance is going to play into potentially more distribution. But I also wanted to draw the attention on the regulatory risk here because my understanding is that the Basel IV first time implementation is now expecting to cost you just \u20ac5 billion additional RWA, so not the \u20ac7.5 billion that had initially been guided. Obviously, this discussion ongoing on whether FRTB implementation in Europe is going to be delayed. I know no decision has been made yet, but assuming this would get delayed by another year, could that mean also upside risk to your distribution plans for 2025 beyond the actual performance itself? And then a word on provisions that we haven't discussed too much yet. I think the guidance you provide for 2025 points to \u20ac1.4 billion to \u20ac1.6 billion of provisions. Consensus is right in the middle at \u20ac1.5 billion. So just if you could discuss where is the risk on that number, whether to the upside or the downside, what gives you the confidence, the visibility on that number with a special word also, if you can, on the U.S. commercial real estate portfolio, especially U.S. offices after the Fed is more likely now to keep rates higher for longer?\nJames Von Moltke: Also great questions. And for the others, I won't say great questions again. So don't be insulted if I don't repeat that. So briefly on the start of the buyback program. Look, every year, we start with the buybacks that offset employee share deliveries against previous year compensation. So it actually takes a little while until we complete that and so we would only start the \u20ac750 million once that is done. It takes a little bit of time, but we're in the market really for most of the first quarter with the former buyback. As is last -- was the case last year, I can see some of this amount slipping into the early part of Q3, but we would expect to get the bulk of it done earlier than that. On the -- I'll talk about the trajectory on CRR3. Look, it's more or less where we thought it'd be. And yes, there are a bit still to come. So there's a bit of a round trip in the first quarter. Because in the technical details of CRR3, the OpRisk RWA doesn't hit you January 1, but only really moderately first. But the net number of about 15 basis points down, there's a -- it's about 5 basis points up in our estimates on January 1 and then 20 basis points to come on OpRisk RWA. There are some modest adjustments also in and credit risk that come into it. That trajectory is encouraging. But as Christian says, we need to kind of seeing how the year develops and actually, the calculations are relatively new and fresh. And so it will take time for the systems, the models and what have you to settle a little bit, and we'll be back to you. On FRTB, that is an opportunity. Naturally, we need to plan with the expectation that, that will be implemented in January of next year, and we would stick with the estimate of around really \u20ac7.5 billion of impact in RWA from the first of the year, '26. I think there's a decent likelihood it will be delayed just because I think we all believe and so does some of the legislators that creating a competitive disadvantage for the European banks in this area, waiting until FRTB implementation comes to the United States and the U.K. would be unnecessarily damaging. And hence, we do think that's an opportunity. And at a point in time where it's more certain, it can enter into our capital trajectory and thinking. I would add that there's some other potential changes in our requirements going forward that can impact, say, MDA. And then lastly, on CLP, it's a relatively wide range. I think if you asked us today, we'd probably stay closer to the top end of the range, given that we still have to see, as you say, commercial real estate, the moderation take place, we're looking at the domestic middle market portfolio, as we've talked about in the past, in the economic environment that's still uncertain. But we do and hence, the confidence about moderation, we do think we're at the back end of this credit cycle. So from what we see today, we're quite confident about the improvement. \u20ac1.6 billion, so the high end would represent about 33 basis points, which as you know from our prior years and also prior guidance, would be relatively at a higher end for us. But obviously, there's a lot still to kind of water to pass under the bridge between now and the end of the year. Hopefully, that covered all your questions, Flora.\nFlora Bocahut: Yes. Can I just clarify when you just said that the CLPs could be closer to the top end of the range, you mean \u20ac1.6 billion?\nJames Von Moltke: Yes, the 400 on a quarterly basis, look, I think a little bit like last year, we would expect maybe to start -- the first quarter or 2 at the higher end and then ameliorate as the year goes by. Again, we'll have to see how that plays out both in each of the quarters and the year. Hence, we gave you quarterly guidance rather than the full year, but just the widest end of the range, therefore, would be the -- ends of the range of \u20ac1.4 billion to \u20ac1.6 billion. Incidentally, actually, just to come back on one thing, Flora, you're right. We looked at the consensus and really consensus is in line with our guidance and thinking on most line items, of which credit loss provisions is one. Obviously, the cost is another prior to any adjustment for FX, as Ken pointed out. And the gap is really on revenues.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst : First, a clarification, James, I think I heard you saying potential changes in requirements that can impact MDA? Can you elaborate on this, what do you mean did I understand it correctly? And then secondly, on the Private Bank on Slide 4. I appreciate you are on the journey but still 5% ROE is still incredibly low. What -- for retail bank in Europe, it should be at least be double. What do you have in mind? And what complete actions are you taking to significantly boost the RoTE here?\nJames Von Moltke: So Julie, I'll start with the first on MDA and Christian will talk to the private bank. Look, MDA, right, has gone up for us to around a little bit over 13.3%. And that, therefore, drives our views on the level of CET1 that we need to run at with an appropriate buffer against that. And of course, the 13.8% is a good place to be in that regard. There will be some changes, as we talked about FRTB denominator impact, but also potentially some changes in MDA. One example would be our OSII positioning might take a year. But given our relative score in terms of G-SIFI ness, call it, we would expect to be coming down in our G-SIB over time as an example. The second is inside our numbers, you have the mortgage sectoral buffer, which is already -- which is also impacting how we're capitalized. So my point is that the level of capitalization that we operate at now and the gap to MDA that's implied by it is a conservative point, let's put it that one on both numbers.\nChristian Sewing: On the private bank, first of all, you're right. I mean, a 5% RoTE, obviously, not sufficient at all. But therefore, we are doing this full transformation. And by the way, if we digest and really divide the private bank, the real challenge, which we are working on in Retail Germany. Now when you look at the levers, first of all, at the start, we see a good revenue momentum in the private bank, by the way, also in Retail Germany. So overall, the private bank will go by approximately \u20ac400 million year-over-year. Secondly, one of the largest cost takeouts also in absolute numbers is next year again in the Private Bank in Germany or that what James also said, where we put restructuring costs for the further fallout, so to say, in a positive way from the IT technology transfer from Postbank to Deutsche Bank is paying off. So also there from a cost point of view, it's another and not only low 3-digit million number where actually, Claudio is reducing costs in the private bank. And thirdly, James gave you another example from an RoTE point of view, we have certain portfolios or some portfolios in the private bank, where from an SBA methodology, we are simply not rewarding our shareholders. And at the end of the day, our capital in a sufficient way. And that is the third lens where with repricing, but also with reallocating capital, we are improving the picture. One bit only that you also see there is full attention on, and we are working on it. If you just look at Q4 2024 and you look at Claudio's private bank costs versus Q4 2023, we had a reduction of 9%. That shows you that there is full focus on that transition that we know we need to get the cost down. The plans are there. Implementation is underway. But fortunately, it's not only that, it's revenues and SBA.\nUnidentified Analyst : Can I just follow up? What is the difference in ROE between Germany and the rest within the Private Bank?\nChristian Sewing: It's in particular from a legacy point of view, the structure of the platforms, the IT platforms we have. So as we did, fortunately, the transfer of the IT last year or in 2023 from Postbank to Deutsche Bank, we are, again, in a constant way, obviously, pulling off applications, closing applications, then we have, obviously, from a simply location point of view, we have the largest number of branch closures. Obviously, also the largest numbers of people where with streamlining the processes going more into a digital offering, in particular, in the retail bank. You see most of the transformation and also the efficiency gains in the Private Bank. So Germany, in this regard from the legacy point of view, system, location, branches, integration of Postbank is in this regard, the one where most of the work is on.\nUnidentified Analyst : Got it. But I was only just on the ROE number between Germany and the rest within the Private Bank?\nJames Von Moltke: We don't publish that number, but I mean, the Wealth Management and personal banking -- and private banking is double digit. So it is we can definitely converge in -- well into the double digits as we address the issues that Christian just alluded to in the German retail personal banking segment.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Hallam from Goldman Sachs.\nChris Hallam: Just two, I guess, sort of modeling questions left for me. Firstly, on the growth in FIC, so if I take the guidance, the \u20ac200 million or so growth that you're guiding to for FICC in 2025 how does that shake out in terms of financing versus nonfinancing? If I look at solid performance in Q4 financing revenues, if I just sort of run rate that through 2025, that's obviously imperfect, but that would sell for effectively all of the \u20ac200 million increase year-over-year in the guidance. So just any kind of color you can give in terms of FIC growth on our line line basis? And then secondly, deposit growth was quite strong in the Private Bank in Q4. So what are you assuming in terms of deposit growth in 2025 within that \u20ac300 million banking NII guidance?\nJames Von Moltke: So Chris, the FIC financing revenues are in the more predictable revenue stream bucket, so the 40% in Christian's Slide 7, so contributing to that \u20ac800 million. FIC market, to your point, would be the \u20ac200 million or \u20ac300 million of contribution in the -- in what we characterize as the remain revenue streams. In FIC financing, however, there's -- as you know, it splits between carry and revenues. We're quite encouraged given the 12% growth we had now just in the fourth quarter about our ability to continue growing that revenue stream. So it should do at least \u20ac100 million, maybe some more in NII and then earn additional fees, I would think, fee growth. But just to clarify, in the buckets, the rest of FIC markets, so rates, credit and emerging markets would -- and FX would be the balance of the remaining revenue stream number. In terms of deposit growth, we've seen quite strong deposit growth. And actually, what's been encouraging is it has shifted back into site deposits from term. And that's, as we talked about, being helpful for the margin on the deposit side. We are expecting considerable growth in both of the deposit businesses in 2025. I can't give you precise numbers. But we see liquidity in the marketplace and the ability to put on liabilities at attractive prices and SBA. The one caveat I do want to mention, though, is we talked last quarter about a couple of relatively concentrated deposit levels. So we're sort of -- as those wind down, we are offsetting the runoff of a couple of concentrated deposits. And hence, you'll see the net of those 2 in the numbers over the course of the year. Also Q4, as we had a year -- actually 2 years ago, represents a relatively high print. So I would see us sort of recovering to the Q4 level over the course of Q1, maybe into Q2 and then more of that growth flowing through into the back half of the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stefan Stalmann from Autonomous.\nStefan Stalmann: I would like to start with the strategic question, please. There's quite a lot of M&A activity these days in European Asset Management between BNP and [indiscernible], Texas and [indiscernible]. Does that change anything in the way that you look at your asset management strategy, please? And then would you actually be willing to consider M&A? And then just two number questions, please. The first on market risk-weighted assets. From what you say about the trajectory in the fourth quarter, it seems that your market risk-weighted assets must now be around \u20ac19 billion or maybe even a bit lower, which I think is the lowest level since you started disclosing this. Is there any possibility that this is snapping back? Or is there something more structural at work here? And finally, you mentioned not only this time, but also previously that you have benefited from credit hedges. So some of your credit loss provisions have been offset by revenue elsewhere. Can you maybe give us a rough sense of how much revenue was actually generated from these hedges in 2024, please? And in which line items which revenue line items, we would find them.\nJames Von Moltke: Thanks for the question, Stefan. Just briefly, we love our asset management business. We think DWS is really well positioned in today's markets. And having now exceeded the \u20ac1 trillion or dollar level, we can see that it has scale and profitability and also growth prospects. And so while we obviously see what's going on strategically in the market around us, we think we're well positioned. On the market risk RWA side, you're absolutely right, $19 billion is correct and it represents a relatively low level. Two reasons. One is year-end is often just like seasonally below. And secondly, you will have seen in the VAR numbers relatively low VAR, some of which reflects the volatility in the market and not so much the book. And hence, we would expect some amount of recovery, if you like, or an increase in market risk RWA during the course of the year. As it relates to the credit hedges, I need to double check the number, but it's sort of orders of magnitude around $100 million, a little bit more, I think, in the businesses, mostly reflected in remaining income in the businesses. And some in interest income. So a bit of a split depending on whether you see it in the investment bank or the corporate bank. And those hedges, we've talked about, I think, $42 billion of total sort of, if you like, hedges. Those hedge volumes, we well, we'll look to grow from here given what we say, I said about SRTs and the market availability. But these are ongoing programs that we have. So you can assume that type of protection and probably growing from here. Going forward, we manage concentration risks as well as capital usage with instruments.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citi.\nAndrew Coombs: Two, please. follow-ups. Firstly, you said that there are 2 areas of investment in your earlier commentary. One was the tech controls and remediation. The other was growing the franchise beyond the initial revenue ambitions. And I think you have given us a few points of where that has been over the course of the call, but perhaps you can just give more granular examples of which areas you have expanded beat on your initial ambitions. And given you haven't changed the revenue guidance the $25 million, but you have the costs, what is the payback period on those investments. Do you think you're going to see that come through in '26, '27, that would be useful. And then my second question is just on that revenue bridge. Thank you for the very granular answer you gave earlier around the core divisions and see how that adds up to \u20ac2 billion. But at the same time, James also gave guidance on the corporate center or \u20ac200 million loss per quarter, which would see suggest you would have much lower revenue contribution from the corporate center, given how much that contributed in Q2 and Q3 of '24. So what's the offset there?\nJames Von Moltke: Thanks, Andrew. I think it was slightly distinct the line, but I hope I caught everything. So in reverse order, the corporate center, and I think something interesting to point out on Page 5 of the deck, we talked in earlier quarters that there can be some volatility that's created by the corporate center. But I'd said at the time that it ultimately typically nets to 0 over the course of the year. And that was the case in '24, and we expect it to be the case in '25. So at the very bottom of the chart on the left, you can see that's our current expectation, but some of it is hard to predict, given, for example, valuation and timing differences are market related. But hopefully, that's a good indication. On the cost side, the walk I gave earlier to say it was about 1/3 of each of business investments, technology and controls was sort of a multiyear view going from our last Investor Day. More recently, what has been the places where we've put additional investment. I'd say the corporate bank, probably the first destination in terms of some plans that we've actually been working on for some time, but now have decided to implement, which is actually relatively broad-based in the corporate bank, but as an acceleration of some hiring and also technology investments that David Linn and his team have identified and are ready to execute and have begun the execution of -- in Private Bank, there are some technology investments that we had been kind of waiting to make decisions on, but feel are important to make, again, to keep pace with the industry where, as you can all see, in your own, I'm sure, personal lives, there's a bit of an arms race going on in terms of the capabilities for digital banking as well as some of the physical infrastructure there and then a little bit sort of a reacceleration of hiring on the RM side in that business. And then lastly, we've talked about O&A. We've -- I think we've largely completed the build-out of O&A, but there are a handful of additional hires that we've made and we've talked about also on the FICC market side, again, all of which we see as supportive of revenue, not just in '25, but in the years beyond. And so I just do want to emphasize that management's decision-making as we went through this most recent plan cycle has been not just about supporting performance in '25, but making sure we're building the company to be sustainably profitable and growing in profitability. In the years beyond, which actually one last thing to say. We look also at the 26 consensus where, as you can imagine, from the chart, especially Christian's Page 9 you can see an even greater divergence between what we believe the trajectory of the company is and what is currently in the consensus Mr. Coombs is still connected. Sorry, that last comment was indistinct. Can you repeat?\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jerry Sigee BNP Paribas.\nJerry Sigee: I'll make it quick. Just on your ROE target, you're making the same ROE with heavier costs. I guess the offset is the balance sheet efficiency. So effectively less profit but less capital. Is that the right way to think about the math on that? And then secondly, we talked about in an earlier question, the possibility of delaying FRTB and Basel IV implementation. Do you worry about the risk that the U.S. actually cancels it or dilutes it completely? Would that leave you at a competitive disadvantage? Or is this now quite marginal for you as well?\nJames Von Moltke: Sorry, FRTB -- well, sorry, FRTB, look, we're -- there are a number of different aspects of FRTB, how many portfolios you put in standardized versus modeled how the models work and of course, when it's implemented, you have to assume that FRTB once implemented, will be relatively sort of consistent across the world. That's not a given necessarily, but it's a major assumption that we need to make. But -- so yes, we -- what we are concerned about is a disadvantage -- competitive disadvantage if it's implemented in Europe only, and not in the U.K. and the U.S., that's a situation that would create a significant sort of disadvantage for us.\nChristian Sewing: Let me just chime in there. First of all, it was a good sign and good decision that there was a postponable by 1 year. actually, the level of attention at the EU commission when it comes to FRTB and providing a level playing field is higher than ever before. It's clearly on the agenda, not obviously of the banks but also of the EU commission. So obviously, I don't know whether at the end of the day, it will be implemented here and not in the U.S. But at least we have, in my view, a complete level of attention at the EU Commission to listen to us and to make sure that the level playing field is not lost on that point.\nJames Von Moltke: And to your first point about capital, yes, capital efficiency certainly helped. I mean it's a walk of revenues where we're significantly higher than where we expected to be when we did the IDD with you. actually, credit costs at this point in the cycle also higher than where we expected to be. Costs we've talked about and capital is more efficient. I will say AT1 coupons higher than where we'd assumed as well. So there are a number of different moving parts from the Investor Day 2 that we can trace through. But the capital efficiency was certainly a supportive lever.\nOperator: Next question comes from line of [indiscernible].\nUnidentified Analyst : Two quick questions from my side. I wanted to come back to Slide 16 and especially you look at the \u20ac900 million in investments and inflation. I was wondering if you could split that 900 to mandatory investments, it's regulatory or those you feel clearly necessary in the tax stack. You mentioned perhaps the private bank. And some of the discretionary investments into growth, be it the corporate bank, be it the -- that's number one. Number 2 is on loan growth. It seems like you're seeing some improvement in period-end loan balances both in the Corporate Bank and also in the private bank. Could you talk about what you're seeing in your business? Is this just a blip, we shouldn't read too much into it? Or is this perhaps the start of a turning point?\nJames Von Moltke: So the simple answer to your question is regulatory or sort of controls remained costs are most of, I'll call it, $200 million. year-on-year in the sort of mandatory bucket. And then there is some additional expense that are still around remediation control improvements that we would see as not mandatory and where there would be some flexibility potentially to push out in time. So a reasonably considerable amount of pressure coming from that. I mentioned inflation, the $100 million of inflation above our expectations, sits on top of inflation that has been running sort of $300 million to $400 million for the past several years. So there's a considerable headwind from those 2 items.\nChristian Sewing: And on the financing side, we have seen the FICC financing, as also mentioned by James before, was actually a nice level of increase over 2024. We actually also see that going forward. That's clearly a business which we want to grow, I think where we have a competence like almost nobody else. And given also the international focus on this business, it's clearly growing. On the S and PV side, slightly down, excluding FX. Now on the private banking side, it is also an effect of that what we discussed before, i.e., the SVA methodology that we are not entirely happy with all subsegments of that portfolio James mentioned the mortgage portfolio, where we on purpose actually said we don't want to allocate that much capital Obviously, also the interest rate development in the run-up to 24 is obviously then also curbing demand a bit in Germany. And on the mid-cap side, -- at the end of the day, you see in this regard, a little bit of 2 different speeds. If you look at the loan demand of German corporates for investing in Germany, it's down. is clearly down, and that's also something which hopefully will be addressed when we talk about structural reforms, which are needed in Germany. But the other hand is that also German corporate is actually taking investments in order to invest internationally, that's clearly up. And that is, again, something where obviously we can position ourselves given our global approach.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Tom Hallett from KBW.\nTom Hallett: Firstly, I suppose I would have thought confidence around the \u20ac32 billion guidance would have increased given kind of what we've seen year-to-date and then the steepening yield curve. So was there a temptation to raise that \u20ac32 billion target by any chance? And then secondly, on Slide 9, your aspiration is meaningfully above 2024 level, okay? And I just kind of want to know what the drivers of that would be? Should I be splitting that between half profit at half kind of RWA optimization? How should I think about that?\nChristian Sewing: Look, Tom, let me take the first question. look, our confidence in the \u20ac32 billion, obviously, with the delivery of Q4 and the momentum we see also what we have seen in January has increased that we will meet that. But I think it's not the time now to further raise it. I think it is that what we have done before in revenues we give a number. We have full confidence in it, and now we have to deliver. And it's all about execution. But in that execution capacity, again, how our businesses are positioned, I have full confidence. But at this point in time, I think we should first now deliver Q1 and Q2, and then we can talk about anything else.\nAlexander Von zur M\u00fchlen: Just in terms of the line now, that chart on Page 9 is deliberately illustrative in part because with the business units themselves in terms of profitability and and also capital usage or we don't disclose publicly. But you can work out the starting point average from our public accounts is about 1.5%, given all that took place in 2024, we think there's scope to more than double that average level over the next couple of years. And so that is, again, underscores a little bit the confidence that we have about the trajectory going forward. and the tools that we've built. Now some of that has to do with the costs, especially nonoperating costs from 2024 falling away. But a lot of it has to do with the levers for growth that Christian talked about steady kind of cumulative operating leverage across the businesses that we see. And then to your point, some amount of efficiency of the usage of the capital. We don't see though declining from here. So I just want to emphasize that if you're at around about $360 million over the years, we would -- especially given CRR3 and the other changes, that number would still grow by make up a number of $20 billion even with the efficiencies that we're putting through. So it is a significant amount of impact from operating leverage over time and all the other levers we've talked about.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ioana Patriniche for any closing remarks.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you for joining us and for your questions.

        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Thank you, Ioana, and a warm welcome from me. Before we discuss our preliminary 2024 financials in detail, I wanted to offer you my perspective on 2024. This was a vital transition year for us, which has seen us deliver crucial building blocks in the transformation of our business model. We have moved past a number of legacy items absorbing a series of nonoperating costs predominantly litigation matters, which have masked the underlying strength of our business. Our operating performance demonstrated execution against our plans as our pre-provision profit increased by 19% compared to 2023, if adjusted for certain specific items. Importantly, however we are now set for a clean and significantly more profitable year in 2025 with the foundation now build for further improvements in the years beyond. Let me spend a bit more time talking through this turnaround work, which has resulted in a fundamentally different bank in terms of earnings power in combination with a better risk profile and improved resilience all of which are visible in our 2024 financials. Let's start with the top line. First and foremost, we have successfully positioned all our businesses to perform by strengthening our market position, reinforcing our focus on clients and working with deep dedication as their Global Hausbank. Our business have clear momentum which is visible through our revenue delivery of over \u20ac30 billion, well above what we thought would be achievable when we first set our 2025 targets. And we are very pleased with the strong start of this year, which, again, demonstrates our clear franchise momentum. Second, on expenses, we delivered on our adjusted cost guidance of \u20ac5 billion each quarter when excluding the already guided exceptional items. We have continued to execute on our operational efficiency measures which gave us room to make critical investments into business growth, technology and controls while reducing redundancies in our cost base in line with our plan. We believe these investment decisions will strengthen our delivery in 2025 and beyond. Third, importantly, we continue to improve our risk profile in 2024, which did come at a cost of \u20ac1.7 billion across 3 specific litigation items. And while these items, of course, impacted our reported results, moving forward, our position to deliver returns is not only strengthened for 2025, but also for future years, particularly given the supportive market backdrop for our businesses. Looking ahead, as we have continued to make conscious investments into our franchise, coupled with stickier inflation, we now expect to end 2025 with a cost income ratio of below 65%. We know we need to continue to focus on cost management in the near and medium term and we have a clear management agenda to address this. Crucially, for this year, we expect to deliver strong positive operating leverage as we increased revenues by \u20ac2 billion year-on-year while keeping adjusted costs flat. Fourth, on distributions. We remain committed to capital returns. And today, we are announcing a \u20ac750 million share buyback program in addition to a dividend per share of $0.68 in respect of 2024, which we plan to propose for approval at our Annual General Meeting. Together, this represents a total of \u20ac2.1 billion of capital distributions announced so far this year. As we have said before, we want to maintain a prudent approach to capital management, and we will, of course, look to do more for our shareholders in line with our performance. Our strong CET1 ratio of 13.8% sets us up well for this heading into the rest of the year. And we remain committed to surpassing our total shareholder distribution target of \u20ac8 billion. To summarize, 2024 has not been easy, but it was an important year for us as we took important management actions to secure our trajectory and cement our path to a return on tangible equity above 10% for 2025. Beyond that, we have defined a clear management agenda for further developing our global house bank offering and sustainably increasing returns in 2025 and in the years thereafter. Let's now discuss each of these points in detail starting with our operating momentum on Slide 3. We increased 2024 pre-provision profit by 19% compared to 2023, if adjusted for 3 specific litigation items as well as the goodwill impairment in 2023. The specific litigation items in 2024 comprised the Postbank takeover litigation matter; elevated provisions for Polish FX mortgages; and the derecognition of the reimbursement asset for the Raschem Alliance litigation matter, which James will elaborate on further. Pre-provision profit remained broadly stable on a reported basis as our operating strength enabled us to absorb even large exceptional items. We have delivered sustained operating leverage of 5%. Excluding the specific litigation items in 2024 and the goodwill impairment in 2023. Growth was driven by both revenue momentum and cost discipline. Revenues grew by 4% year-on-year supported by our deep dedication and client engagement and around 75% came from more predictable revenue streams in Corporate Bank, Private Bank, Asset Management and FIC financing. A well-diversified revenue mix enabled us to grow through the interest rate cycle. Commissions and fee income increased by 13% year-on-year in line with our strategy and driven by our strategic investments. Net interest income in key banking book segments and other funding outperformed our prior guidance and remained broadly stable year-on-year. Adjusted costs decreased 1% year-on-year to \u20ac20.4 billion or 2% to \u20ac20.2 billion, excluding the preguided real estate measures and U.K. bank levy true-up in the fourth quarter. Excluding these items, we delivered 4 quarters of adjusted cost of around \u20ac5 billion, in line with our plans. We have made steady progress on our efficiency program. This offset conscious investments in the franchise and inflationary pressures. We have now completed measures we've delivered our expected gross savings of \u20ac1.85 billion, almost 3/4 of our \u20ac2.5 billion goal with around \u20ac1.67 billion in savings already realized. As part of this program, we have removed 3,500 roads, primarily reducing nonclient-facing roads, focus in high-cost locations, while recent hires have been focused on technology and controls as well as revenue-generating areas. Turning to Slide 4. Let us now look at the momentum we have created in each of our businesses against the goals set in 2022. At our Investor Day in March 2022, we set ambitious objectives for 2025. With 12 months to go, our business growth focused strategies are delivering strong results against these objectives. The corporate bank remains at the core of the Deutsche Bank franchise, and we have further enhanced its value proposition through a strengthening client franchise and investments in technology supported by our global network. As an example, incremental deals won with multinational clients have increased by around 40% since 2022. The division outperformed its revenue growth ambition despite normalizing interest rates and delivered a return on tangible equity of 13% in 2024, 3x its 2021 level. The Investment Bank is outperforming its revenue growth target and delivered an RoTE of 9% in 2024, cementing its position as a leading European investment bank. We are also particularly pleased we have outperformed the peer average for the full year as we continue to see our investments paying off. The business has demonstrated sustained revenue performance through the cycle since 2021 supported by further diversifying its income stream and increasing market share in origination and advisory by around 50 basis points in 2024. In fixed income and currencies, we have built strong market share and demonstrated sustained growth in financing, which is up 12% year-on-year in 2024 and we achieved significant year-on-year growth of over 60% in O&A in 2024 through considerable market share increases in a growing fee pool. Since 2021, the Private Bank created two distinct businesses to sharpen the commercial focus and to better serve clients' changing needs. We scaled up the Wealth Management franchise successfully turning around profitability in core markets while strengthening our #1 positioning in Germany. In Personal Banking, we have launched a major efficiency transformation with a decisive review of our service model and branch footprint optimization. The business continues to leverage its leading market position with net inflows of \u20ac29 billion, supporting noninterest revenue growth of 5% last year, in line with our strategy. Overall, the division grew revenues in line with targets since 2021. The business has made transformative efficiency gains since 2021, closing a further 125 branches in 2024, increasing the total to almost 400 closures since 2021, in addition to reducing full-time employees by a further 1,300 in 2024 alone. Looking at the fourth quarter more closely, adjusted costs were down 9%, reflecting delivery of savings despite ongoing inflationary pressures. Profitability and higher returns, especially in German Personal Banking, will remain top priorities, and we expect to deliver them by a further streamlining of our branch network and the modernization of both our brands while leveraging the synergies from our unified IT environment. In short, the Private Bank continues its path to sustainably transform the business, which we believe will translate into substantially better returns which would be visible this year and beyond. Asset Management, again, grew assets under management in 2024 by \u20ac115 billion and surpassed \u20ac1 trillion for the first time, boosted by net inflows of \u20ac42 billion into passive investments. Exceeding this mark shows the scale and competitiveness of our Asset Management division. Overall, the business demonstrated its strength and showed increased cost efficiency, leading to an RoTE of 18% in 2024. Driven by the benefits of higher AUM levels and revenue growth initiatives already in place, we expect the compound revenue growth rate in Asset Management to turn positive in 2025 and approach its original ambition. On Slide 5, let me now turn to the question why we feel confident in reaching our 2025 revenue growth ambitions. Since 2021, we have delivered a compound annual growth rate of 5.8%, in line with our upgraded target range. In 2025, we expect continued franchise momentum and our capital-light businesses to drive further growth supported by our investments, increasing the revenue CAGR to around 5.9%. We have a clear road map towards our 2025 target. In the Corporate Bank, we expect revenues to grow by around 5.5% or \u20ac400 million, largely from scaling of commissions and fee income predominantly in trade finance and fee-based institutional business and repricing of existing clients. resilient net interest income will provide further support. Investment Bank revenues are expected to grow by around 8% as we see encouraging trends in the market, good levels of corporate activity and confidence, solid financing conditions and pent-up private equity dry powder. The main growth driver is expected to be O&A with an increase in revenues of approximately \u20ac600 million, reflecting growth globally, but led by the U.S. We have positioned ourselves well to benefit from these trends and grow market share further, supported by our investments, reaching their full potential. We also expect FIC to show continued growth in 2025, driven by ongoing strength and further focused investments in financing. We will continue to develop our wider platform in both existing and adjacent businesses with a focus on the U.S. and flow credit. In the Private Bank, we expect revenue growth of around \u20ac400 million or about 4%, driven by higher NII from continued business volume growth and the deposit hedge rollover as well as growing noninterest income, harvesting benefits from higher assets under management and growth in investment solutions. Finally, we expect asset management to grow by around \u20ac300 million or 12.5%. We expect the business to benefit from the growth in assets under management during 2024 and a strong equity market development this year. which should boost management fees in 2025. We furthermore expect continued growth in passive, including extractors and in alternatives. These drivers underline our confidence in achieving our revenue goal of around \u20ac32 billion in 2025 before FX benefits. At year-end FX rates we expect this number to be around \u20ac32.8 billion. Importantly, all divisions are contributing to the substantial growth from both noninterest revenues and NII, which once again reflects our well-diversified business mix. Around 75% of this growth is expected to come from more predictable revenue streams. Let me now turn to costs on Slide 6. In 2025, our goal is simple: deliver a significant normalization of nonoperating costs and essentially flat adjusted costs despite our ongoing investments into growth. Moving past significantly elevated litigation and other restructuring charges in 2024. We are planning with a clear reduction of \u20ac2.1 billion in nonoperating costs this year. Turning to adjusted costs. Since we presented our ambitions for 2025 at our Investor Day in 2022, we have navigated dynamically through a volatile and fast-moving environment. And this resulted in some additional costs as we choose to make investments in technology controls and business growth and with inflation proving to be more persistent than anticipated. In respect of the additional investments, we have positioned the bank for sustainable growth in 2025 and beyond by investing into 2 key areas. Firstly, growing our franchise beyond our original revenue ambition to better serve our clients and deliver higher rewards for shareholders. Secondly, expanding our initially planned mandatory and strategic investments into technology controls and regulatory remediation. In 2024, we hired 1,300 technology specialists and added 400 targeted revenue-generating roads supporting long-term cost improvements and growth. In 2024 alone, we also invested a further \u20ac1.2 billion into controls, taking the total since 2019 to more than \u20ac6.5 billion. Some of these additional expenses will stay with us this year. However, we expect to offset much of the impact through our cost measures in line with our plan, which we expect to yield further benefits in 2025 and beyond. Our optimization initiatives in Germany are expected to generate savings of close to \u20ac200 million. Investments to reduce the complexity of our organization by improving technology and optimizing the workforce across infrastructure are expected to deliver a further \u20ac300 million. An automization of processes alongside better alignment of our front-to-back setup should deliver another \u20ac200 million. Our initiatives include the previously announced closure of additional branches in 2025. The implementation of new branch formats as well as decommissioning of further applications or moving them to the cloud. The net effect is that we expect to hold our adjusted cost base flat year-on-year while reducing nonoperating costs significantly. James will detail the year-on-year cost work later. This, combined with the anticipated revenue growth of \u20ac2 billion we just discussed will create substantial operating leverage. As a result, we now target a cost income ratio of below 65% this year, marginally higher than our original target, though this will further support growth and business momentum in and beyond 2025. As I said earlier, this does not compromise delivery of our greater than 10% RoTE target or our plans for capital distributions. Let me now turn to this, starting with the path to our return on tangible equity target on Slide 7. We remain on a clear path to achieve our RoTE target of above 10% and in 2025 driven by focused execution across all 3 delivery pillars of our global house bank strategy. As you saw, we have a business-by-business road map to grow revenues to around \u20ac32 billion in 2025, in line with our target growth of 5.5% to 6.5%. Operational efficiencies play a key role in keeping adjusted costs flat in 2025 and thereby reducing total noninterest expenses as nonoperating costs normalize. Capital efficiencies have delivered cumulative RWA equivalent reductions of \u20ac24 billion, close to our end 2025 goal of \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion. In the fourth quarter alone, we delivered \u20ac2 billion of RWA equivalent reductions driven by data and process improvements. We are confident we will reach the upper end of our target range by year-end 2025 through further securitizations and data and process improvements. Delivering on these pillars gives us a clear path to an RoTE about 10% in 2025. The nonrepeat of significant litigation items in 2024 gives us a starting point of an adjusted RoTE above 7%. Firstly, reaching around \u20ac32 billion revenue goal is expected to add more than 2 percentage points to our 2025 RoTE. Around 20% of this growth expected to come from an increase in net interest income by roughly \u20ac400 million, primarily due to the rollover of hedges. Another 40% or roughly \u20ac800 million should come from higher noninterest revenues from more predictable income streams, including from scaling actions and monetizing client relationships in the corporate bank or the spillover effect from higher AUM levels in asset management and private banks. The remaining revenue increase is expected to come primarily from market share expansion in a growing fee in O&A. From a regional perspective, we expect increasing revenues in the Americas, supported by an improving backdrop and reflected our targeted investments while further growth is expected to come from Asia and the Middle East as well as Germany. Secondly, we expect an additional contribution of around 50 basis points from the reduction in noninterest expenses we just discussed. Together, this would bring us already to our targeted RoTE level. And finally, we expect a contribution of around 40 basis points from the reduction of credit loss provisions in 2025 towards more normalized levels. in line with our guidance with our third quarter results. All in all, we see a clear path to achieving our RoTE target of above 10%. Let me now discuss the implications for capital distributions. The value we have created for our shareholders is visible in the growth intangible book value per share by more than 20% since 2021 to almost \u20ac30. This was driven by strong organic capital generation and greater capital efficiency which supported both rising shareholder distributions and business growth. We have received regulatory approval for a share buyback of \u20ac750 million. Additionally, and as guided, we plan to propose a dividend per share of $0.68 for 2024 at our upcoming Annual General Meeting in May, amounting to a distribution of around \u20ac1.3 billion. Together, these initiatives result in shareholder distributions of around \u20ac2.1 billion announced so far in 2025. The announced distributions in 2024 would bring cumulative capital return to around \u20ac5.4 billion since 2022, in line with our promise back in July 2019 when we announced our compete to win strategy. Looking ahead, our guidance for a dividend of \u20ac1 per share in respect of financial year 2025 would equal roughly \u20ac1.9 billion with that modest additional share buybacks this year or next year would be sufficient to get our \u20ac8 billion target. However, we are committed to surpassing this target as we have said before, and it remains our priority to reward our shareholders in line with our performance, and we are confident that we will continue to deliver rising distributions in the coming years. Before I hand over to James, let me give you a brief outlook on our next phase on Slide 9. With the end of 2024, the foundation of the Global Hausbank has been laid successfully. And as you heard, we are set to deliver the return target we have set ourselves for this year, supported by the momentum and operating strength of our franchise. And of course, the management team also looks beyond 2025 towards our longer-term ambitions, and we are committed to step up. We are already implementing measures today to elevate Deutsche Bank's performance beyond 2025, which will make us a more profitable bank. This focuses on client work, our own operations and the way we work and lead. In short, we want to be even more dedicated to our clients' needs while continuing to embed our clear purpose in our daily activities. This will drive further revenue growth. We are determined to make this bank more efficient, and that means changing how we do things. It starts with a simpler organizational setup and a smaller workforce and it requires to become even more technology-driven, which will also enhance client experience. We will put full focus on the productive allocation of capital to improve shareholder value and further balance out our earnings profile. In the end, we aim to become a much more profitable bank overall than our 2025 RoTE target. Our management agenda for 2025 and beyond focuses on 3 key points: Growing value generation; reengineering our target operating model; and stronger leadership. Firstly, we aim to further grow value generation for our shareholders by sharpening our focus on capital allocation and RWA optimization at both business and client level to boost returns. We see tremendous potential from further improving resource productivity across the portfolio via repricing and reallocating capital to high-return franchises supporting further revenue growth. We plan to drive higher resource productivity through capital light originations in line with our strategy and accelerated asset rotation. We aim to boost the profitability of lower-return business through front-to-back efficiency improvements and be disciplined in redeploying capital elsewhere, including making exits, if necessary. We have already started these reviews in some lending portfolios such as mortgages and are seeing benefits of these choices. Secondly, we plan to achieve the next phase of operational efficiencies beyond our \u20ac2.5 billion goal by reengineering our target operating model. Our clear ambition is to operate the bank with a lower head count, and we aim to run a much leaner platform as our investments in technology, automation and controls material. We are tackling inefficiencies by giving business leaders more control over their cost base, coupled with further front-to-end streamlining of processes. We plan to actively reduce management layers and roads and integrate teams as part of our workforce optimization initiatives, in particular, scrutinizing those areas where we do not see the required efficiency improvement. Thirdly, our management agenda emphasizes strengthening risk management and accountability and evolving our culture through a purpose-led framework, we call, this is Deutsche Bank. With our investments, we are well positioned to grow the Global Hausbank model make it more efficient and generate more capital for deployment in the business and shareholder distributions. Our management agenda provides significant scope to further improve our return profile and deliver sustainably growing earnings beyond 2025, unlocking the full potential of this bank. We will provide you with more details on our aspiration and actions beyond 2025 over the course of this year, but our immediate focus remains on demonstrating disciplined execution. With that, let me hand over to James."

        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "Thank you, Christian, and good morning. As usual, let me start with a few key performance indicators on Slide 11. Notwithstanding the items in the fourth quarter that improve our risk profile, we maintained a level of resiliency we could not have shown a few years back, underscoring the successful transformation to date. Our capital position remained robust with the CET1 ratio at 13.8% at year-end despite absorbing the specific litigation items throughout the year and the capital deduction for the \u20ac750 million share buyback announced today. Our liquidity metrics remain sound. The liquidity coverage ratio was 131%, in line with our target and the net stable funding ratio was 121% at the upper end of our target range. Let me now turn to the fourth quarter highlights on Slide 12. Group revenues were \u20ac7.2 billion, up 8% on the prior year quarter. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac420 million, equivalent to 35 basis points of average loans, down \u20ac67 million year-on-year. Noninterest expenses were \u20ac6.2 billion, up 14%, reflecting exceptional nonoperating and adjusted cost items. Nonoperating items were \u20ac945 million in the quarter, including net litigation charges of \u20ac659 million and restructuring and severance charges of \u20ac286 million. Adjusted costs were \u20ac5.3 billion, including charges for optimizing the bank's own real estate footprint of \u20ac100 million as well as a true-up for bank levies in the U.K. of \u20ac134 million. And despite the exceptional cost items, we generated a profit before tax of \u20ac583 million and a net profit of \u20ac337 million. Our tax rate in the fourth quarter came in at 42%. And excluding the aforementioned litigation matters, the tax rate would have been 28%. We expect the 2025 full year tax rate to range between 28% and 29%. In the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.15, and tangible book value per share was \u20ac29.90, up 5% year-on-year. Let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results and start with a review of our net interest income on Slide 13. NII across key banking book segments and other funding was strong at \u20ac3.3 billion, up sequentially and broadly flat on the prior year quarter. Compared to the third quarter, slightly higher deposit volumes, in particular, overnight deposits offset the expected beta conversions in the corporate bank. Private Bank and was up sequentially as we guided before, and FIC financing continued to grow its loan portfolio with a corresponding increase in quarterly revenues. With that, let me turn to the full year NII trends and the outlook for 2025 on the next page. Given the stronger NII in the fourth quarter, we outperformed our prior 2024 full year guidance of \u20ac13.1 billion, reporting \u20ac13.3 billion across our key banking book segments and other funding. This is about \u20ac100 million higher than 2023, reflecting the resilience of our NII even during an environment of falling rates and beta convergence. For 2025, we expect NII yet again to increase to around \u20ac13.6 billion, a sequential increase of around \u20ac400 million. This is in line with our guidance provided last quarter but reflective of the outperformance in the fourth quarter. The key drivers of the rollover effect from our hedges supported by portfolio growth in the Private Bank, Corporate Bank and FIC financing. As a reminder, our hedge portfolio stabilizes our income by extending the tenor of interest rate risk, but it also protects us against a drop in interest rates. We provide further details in the appendix on Slide 38. Based on forward rates at the end of December, we expect the income from the hedge book to grow by several hundred million euros each year as we roll maturing hedges. In current rate conditions, we are more sensitive to the long-term rate development and are less sensitive to short-term movements in policy rates. Turning to Slide 15, Adjusted costs were \u20ac0.3 billion for the quarter. We have seen lower costs across all categories versus the prior year quarter and reduced adjusted costs, excluding bank levies by 2% or \u20ac118 million. Bank levies were driven by the true-up in the U.K. of \u20ac134 million. In line with our guidance in earlier quarters, we managed adjusted costs, excluding bank levies, closer to \u20ac4.9 billion if adjusted for \u20ac100 million from optimizing our own real estate footprint and the other unfavorable impact from exchange movements of around \u20ac60 million. We have included further details in the appendix on Slide 29. On a full year basis, adjusted costs, excluding bank levies, increased by around \u20ac100 million on a constant FX basis, as savings from streamlining our IT platform and lower spend for professional services were offset by higher costs for compensation and benefits, driven by rate growth, higher performance-related compensation and the impact from increased internal workforce. With that, let me turn to our cost guidance for 2025 on Slide 16. As Christian said earlier, a lot has happened since we embarked on our global house bank strategy in 2022. And while we have taken opportunities to not only create a more resilient franchise, but also to ensure that we are better positioned for sustainable growth, there have also been headwinds, which we have not been able to fully offset. Noninterest expenses in 2024 included a number of specific items, which are either nonrecurring in nature or aimed at improving our risk profile and supporting target delivery in 2025. total nonoperating costs were \u20ac2.6 billion, driven by litigation charges for 3 specific items, which amounted to \u20ac1.7 billion. Firstly, the Postbank takeover litigation matter had a full year net impact of \u20ac906 million, reflecting the initial provision and the settlement agreements we entered into in the third quarter. Secondly, the industry-wide FX mortgage matter in Poland resulted in additional provisions of \u20ac329 million in the fourth quarter to reflect our updated estimation of the impact of developments in the market. The total impact for the year was \u20ac500 million. And lastly, the RusChemAlliance Alliance litigation matter, which had an impact of \u20ac262 million in the fourth quarter and affected the corporate bank. Recent developments led to the derecognition of a reimbursement asset as a recovery of the claim through an indemnification obligation could no longer be assessed as virtually certain. However, we believe we are in possession of a valid reimbursement claim and will vigorously assert our position. Other litigation charges of \u20ac366 million were broad-based across a number of smaller items. Additionally, restructuring and severance charges were elevated in the year at around \u20ac530 million, slightly higher than the \u20ac400 million we initially expected for the year and included additional actions taken during the fourth quarter. We made further progress, particularly in the Private Bank to support our strategic transformation, which is aimed at rationalizing our branch footprint in Germany, while improving the access to advisory solutions for our retail clients. Assuming a normalization of overall nonoperating costs, the noninterest expense step off for 2025 would have been \u20ac20.9 billion. For 2025, we expect overall adjusted costs to remain flat year-on-year at around \u20ac20.3 billion, which translates to around \u20ac20.7 billion at year-end FX rates. This is higher relative to our prior guidance, mainly driven by additional investments and business growth opportunities that we identified during our last planning cycle. These investments, particularly into our Corporate Bank and Investment Bank businesses, support our targeted revenue growth this year and position us for further growth beyond. We also see continued demand for control and remediation investments to ensure the bank fulfills all of its regulatory obligations and expectations. In line with our original target, nonoperating costs are expected to materially reduce to around \u20ac400 million in 2025 as litigation and restructuring and severance charges normalize. As a result, noninterest expenses in 2025 are expected to be around \u20ac20.8 billion, resulting in a full year cost-income ratio of below 65%, but delivering a significant implied operating leverage of 16%. The investments leading to a higher cost base will also support toward further operating leverage beyond 2025. In short, although the reported numbers for 2024 are higher than originally planned, Christian and I are encouraged regarding our trajectory going into 2025. Let us now turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 17. In line with the guidance provided in October, full year provisions stood at \u20ac1.8 billion, equivalent to 38 basis points of average loans. Provisions were impacted by specific headwinds, including transitional effects from the Postbank integration, which continue to taper off; two relatively fast-paced larger corporate events impacting provisions at a level unusual compared to historical standards and which were materially hedged as well as a cyclically higher level of commercial real estate provisions, which we expect to decrease on a full year basis in 2025. You will find the full year update on transitory headwinds on Slide 42 of the appendix. When looking at the fourth quarter, provision for credit losses was \u20ac420 million or 35 basis points of average loans. As guided, the sequential decrease in provisions of \u20ac74 million was due to a reduction of Stage 3 provisions as the Corporate Bank benefited from a larger recovery on a legacy workout situation. Investment Bank provisions were lower, benefiting from a further small reduction of provisioning levels in CRE. During the fourth quarter, the bank completed the loan portfolio sale in the U.S. Stage 3 provisions decreased sequentially to \u20ac415 million. Provisions were mainly driven by the Private Bank, which included impact from a small number of legacy cases in Wealth Management as well as the investment bank where CRE remained the main driver. Stage 1 and 2 provisions were negligible as various portfolio effects were offset by slightly improved macroeconomic forecasts and overall recalibrations -- overlay recalibrations in the fourth quarter. Before we move on, a few remarks on asset quality. We maintained tight underwriting standards and continue to conservatively manage our loan book, including single-name concentration risks through comprehensive hedging programs with a total notional volume of hedges standing at \u20ac42 billion. Our regular and comprehensive portfolio reviews show that overall credit quality remains stable and forward-looking indicators such as rating migration and trends in our noninvestment-grade portfolio as well as watch list ratios do not suggest a noteworthy deterioration in asset quality. We also see broadly stable developments in our domestic market as outlined on Slide 45 of the appendix, and we are carefully monitoring the developments surrounding it. With that, let me turn to capital on Slide 18. Our fourth quarter common equity Tier 1 ratio came in at 13.8%. CET1 capital decreased primarily reflecting the deduction of the \u20ac750 million share buyback from excess capital. As expected, market risk RWA decreased driven by SBAR and incremental risk charge from careful positioning into year-end. The marginal increase in credit risk was driven by model changes, largely offset by reductions from capital efficiency measures. With respect to the CRR3 go-live effective January 1, 2025, our pro forma CET1 ratio was 13.9%, around 5 basis points above our ratio for year-end 2024. However, the CRR3 go-live will also lead to around \u20ac5 billion of RWA equivalent impact from operational risk to come in the first quarter. Hence, the total impact of CRR3 is a CET1 ratio burden of around 15 basis points, consistent with prior guidance. At the end of the fourth quarter, our leverage ratio stood at 4.6%, flat sequentially as the benefit from additional Tier 1 capital issuance in the quarter was offset by the CET1 deduction for the \u20ac750 million share buyback announced today and FX effects. With regard to bail-in ratios, we continue to operate with significant buffers over all requirements. In short, our capital position remains strong and already reflects our approved share buyback. And with that, let us turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 20. Corporate Bank revenues in the fourth quarter were \u20ac1.9 billion, 1% higher sequentially driven by growth in deposit revenues from interest hedging and higher volumes offsetting ongoing margin normalization. In 2024, we have made good progress on our growth initiatives to offset the normalization of deposit revenues by further accelerating noninterest revenue growth with 5% growth in commissions and fee income across all regions and a particularly strong contribution from our trade finance business. The deposit base remains strong throughout the entire year as deposits increased by \u20ac23 billion year-on-year, driven by higher site deposits in corporate treasury services and favorable FX movements. Provision for credit losses stood at \u20ac23 million, significantly lower driven by a larger recovery. Noninterest expenses were higher, driven by the RusChemAlliance Alliance litigation matter while adjusted costs decreased by 6% year-on-year, driven by lower direct costs and internal service cost allocations. This resulted in a post-tax return on tangible equity of 7.1% and a cost income ratio of 81%. I will now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 21. Revenues for the fourth quarter were 30% higher year-on-year on a reported basis with strong growth across the franchise. Revenues in fixed income and currencies increased by 26% with year-on-year improvements across all businesses. This represented the highest fourth quarter revenues on record. Financing revenues were significantly higher, reflecting strong fee income across the business, combined with an increased carry profile. Rates revenues were significantly higher, while its credit trading, foreign exchange and emerging markets increased benefiting from heightened market activity and client engagement. Moving to Origination & Advisory, revenues were significantly higher both year-on-year and sequentially with market share gains across business lines in a growing industry field fee pool. Advisory revenues were significantly higher, reflecting material market share gains year-on-year in a static industry fee pool. Debt origination revenues also increased and reflected strength in leverage debt driven by strong pipeline execution in an active market. Noninterest expenses were lower year-on-year due to the nonrepeat of a goodwill impairment in the prior year quarter. Adjusted costs were essentially flat when excluding the increase in U.K. bank levies mentioned earlier. Loan balances increased compared to the prior year, driven by the impact of FX translation, combined with growth in financing. Provision for credit losses was \u20ac101 million or 37 basis points of average loans significantly lower year-on-year due to the non-repeat of Stage 1 and 2 model-related provisions in the prior year, while Stage 3 provisions also decreased. Let me now turn to Private Bank on Slide 22. The Private Bank is making progress both in creating revenue momentum and putting transformation-related costs and transitory credit costs behind us. Revenues of \u20ac2.4 billion in the quarter reflect noninterest revenue growth of 6% year-on-year on the back of higher investment product revenues. NII declined by 5% driven by continued higher funding costs from the impact of minimum reserves, the group neutral impact of certain hedging costs as well as a benefit from episodic lending revenues in the prior year quarter. Excluding these effects, fourth quarter revenues in the Private Bank would have been up 6% year-on-year. Personal Banking revenues were impacted by aforementioned higher funding allocations and hedging costs, partially offset by higher deposit revenues. Wealth Management and Private Banking revenues were essentially flat as higher investment product revenues and lending growth was offset by the nonrecurrence of episodic lending revenues in the prior year. The business attracted net inflows into assets under management of \u20ac2 billion, supported by deposit campaigns in Germany. Outflows in investment products were mainly driven by specific and isolated client transactions. As outlined in the third quarter, we see cost savings coming through as the Private Bank continues its transformation with a further 74 branch closures in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to 125 this year and accelerated head count reductions of more than 1,300 FTE in the past 12 months, mainly in Germany. The substantial improvement in adjusted cost of 9% reflects the benefits from transformation initiatives and lower regulatory as well as client service remediation costs, which are now effectively behind us. Noninterest expenses declined by 5% year-on-year despite higher restructuring and severance costs. Provision for credit losses reflects continued workout activities on a small number of legacy cases in wealth management, while transitory effects from operational backlog are taping off as expected. The overall quality of our domestic and international loan portfolios remains solid. Let me now turn to Asset Management on Slide 23, which reached a key milestone during the fourth quarter by surpassing \u20ac1 trillion of assets under management for the first time. Scale is becoming increasingly important in this industry and for the DWS franchise, favorable market trends support our strategic positioning, especially given our strong position in passive products. And a usual reminder, the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Profit before tax more than doubled from the prior year period, driven by higher revenues. Revenues increased by 22% versus the prior year. This was primarily from higher management fees of \u20ac647 million from both active and passive products driven by growth in average assets under management. Additionally, performance fees more than doubled from the prior year period, primarily due to the recognition of a substantial multi-asset performance fee. Other revenues principally reflected a negative revaluation of the fair value of guarantees and lower investment income, partly offset by lower treasury funding costs. Noninterest expenses and adjusted costs were both essentially flat compared to the prior year. Passive products continued their strong performance driven by X-trackers with a further \u20ac14 billion in the quarter, contributing to \u20ac42 billion of net inflows for the year. Cash alternatives, quantitative solutions and multi-asset also achieved good results with combined net inflows of \u20ac6 billion more than offsetting net outflows in active equity and fixed income products. Assets under management increased by \u20ac49 billion in the quarter, driven by positive FX effects and net inflows. The cost-income ratio for the quarter declined to 67% and return on tangible equity was 21%, both improving from the prior year quarter. This morning, DWS communicated its outlook for 2025 and introduced new medium-term strategic targets, including 10% earnings per share growth per year from the starting point in 2025 to 2027. For further details, please have a look at the DWS disclosure on their Investor Relations website. Moving to Corporate & Other on Slide 24. Corporate & Other reported a pretax loss of \u20ac621 million this quarter, driven by the provision increase for foreign currency mortgages of \u20ac329 million, resulting from updates to the provision model parameters to reflect impacts of recent developments in the estimated cost of the legal risk. This compares to a pretax profit of \u20ac104 million in the prior year quarter, which included a provision release of \u20ac287 million relating to legacy litigation matters. Revenues were negative \u20ac99 million this quarter, primarily driven by retained funding and liquidity impacts. This compares to negative \u20ac64 million in the prior year quarter, with the decrease driven by valuation and timing differences, which were positive \u20ac87 million in the quarter compared to positive \u20ac143 million in the prior year quarter. Pretax losses associated with legacy portfolios primarily reflect the aforementioned litigation matters. At the end of the fourth quarter, risk-weighted assets stood at \u20ac34 billion, including \u20ac13 billion of operational risk RWA. In aggregate, RWAs have reduced by \u20ac6 billion since the prior year quarter mainly reflect a change in the allocation of operational risk RWA. Leverage exposure was \u20ac38 billion at the end of the quarter, slightly lower than the prior year quarter. For 2025, we expect a significantly lower pretax loss for Corporate & Other of approximately \u20ac200 million per quarter or \u20ac800 million for the full year, mainly reflecting the nonrecurrence of legacy litigation matters. As usual, this includes some uncertainty, particularly associated with the valuation and timing differences. Finally, let me turn to the group outlook on Slide 25. We believe we are on track to deliver increased revenues of \u20ac2 billion to achieve this year's revenue growth of around \u20ac32 billion, which translates to around \u20ac32.8 billion at year-end FX rates. We remain committed to rigorous cost management and we'll manage our cost base to a cost income ratio of below 65% for 2025. Although this is higher than the level we were previously aiming for, we feel good that the level of investment in 2025 positions us for incremental opportunities and higher returns over time while also further improving our control environment. We continue to expect an amelioration of provision for credit losses in 2025 as the transitory headwinds we called out previously subside. This should result in a reduction to around \u20ac350 million to \u20ac400 million of average quarterly provisions with further normalization expected in the following years. Our strong capital position gives us a solid step off for our 2025 and 2026 distribution of [audio gap]. We remain committed to our capital distribution target. The \u20ac750 million share buyback announced today and the dividend of $0.68 per share, which we plan to propose at our Annual General Meeting, brings us to \u20ac2.1 billion of capital distributions so far this year. Our full attention remains on delivering an RoTE of above 10% in 2025 driven by continued revenue momentum, cost control and balance sheet efficiency. And these are the levers to also deliver further improved profitability beyond 2025. With that, let me hand back to Ioana, and we look forward to your questions."

And in particular, what gives you confidence that you can reach \u20ac32 billion and how the start of the year position you towards these targets? The second question will be on share buyback. You previously alluded to a share buyback annual growth of roughly 50%, which would put you at \u20ac1 billion share buyback versus the 750 that you announced. So the question is, can we expect more throughout the years and at what point in time during this year? And also, what are the performance criteria that you're looking at to potentially announce more?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "It's Christian. Let me start with your questions, and then James can obviously contribute. Look, what makes us confident is, first of all, the overall positioning and foundation, which we have built over the last 4 or 5 years as a Global Hausbank to our clients, the momentum -- the development in all 4 businesses, feedback from clients. To be honest, in all the last 3 or 4 years, we not only met our revenue targets, but even exceeded that in the years really makes me confident that from the offering we have from the positioning we have is actually the right starting point also for the next years. And that feedback, Nicolas, we get continuously back from our clients, be it institutional clients, corporate clients and private clients. And let me also say that, in particular, the geopolitical items which we are facing in this world, in this regard, to be honest, support us, people want our advice. Corporates talk to us on their amended networks. So the mandates we get from the corporate side, from the institutional side, is, again, something which really makes me confident and is on a level which we haven't seen before. Now to the bridge from \u20ac30.1 billion, to be honest, to \u20ac32 billion. What makes me confident and how do we see that? I would really kind of divide that in three parts: Number one, it's \u20ac400 million coming from NII, and that is obviously reflecting the hedging which we have already put in place. This will, in particular, come from the PV and the CV side. And on top of that, we see also the growth in our fixed financing. So that is approximately \u20ac400 million, which we will see also the good work which we have done on the treasury side with our business. So that is locked in. Now the next thing is, and we always talk about, so to say, the more predictable business we see approximately \u20ac800 million, if not even a bit more, from the more predictable business. And that, in particular, is the Private Bank, Asset Management and the Corporate Bank. Now in those, you have approximately \u20ac400 million from the Corporate Bank. That, again, comes from active repricing monetizing our existing clients, scaling the business which we have invested in. If you look into our investment, which we have done in '23 -- in '24, but in particular, looking at the investment plan for '25, a high degree and partially the highest amounts in those years and in particular, in 25% goes into the Corporate Bank to really scale up our offering. And you have seen the overall development of the corporate bank, which is at the core of our franchise. And therefore, I can see at least this \u20ac400 million of uptick in the year 2025. And again, if I look at the mandates, which we are constantly winning how the year started, I'm very optimistic here. The other \u20ac400 million is in particular coming from the PB and asset management side. And here, a lot of prework has been done. I think in the prepared remarks, we talked about the growth in the assets under management on both sides, the private bank and the asset management side. So obviously, with the fees generated out of that, we will see higher returns. There is no drag on the NII side. I talked about the initial \u20ac400 million. So therefore, we can clearly see with the increased volume, higher revenues. Last but not least, I also said that in the discussions before, which we had on a quarterly side, there is a lot of momentum also in Germany, actually in the retail bank I think Germany, one of the biggest problems and challenges we have is actually with our pension plans in the next years. And more and more, this is -- these are the discussions, which we have with our clients. And again, then applying that to 15 million Postbank clients now being on our IT platform is a huge opportunity for us and [indiscernible] is banking on that. That brings us those \u20ac2 billion to \u20ac1.2 billion. So you are kind of at \u20ac31.2 million, \u20ac31.3 billion. Where is the rest coming from? \u20ac500 milion to \u20ac600 million, in particular, in the Investment Bank from the O&A business. I think James and I talked a lot about that over the last 18 months. We did on purpose the investments in the middle of 2023, not only Numis, but in particular, also the hirings of senior directors in the Corporate Finance business. I think we could show with the growth rates in 2024 that this started to pay off. I'm really proud what [indiscernible] has done in that business. Look at the Q4 numbers in the O&A business. We clearly outperformed the market. And I can see that this momentum is going on. So we believe that actually in the O&A market, we can increase our market share by approximately 50 basis points to approximately 3 percentage points. And then I also do believe that actually the fee pool, in particular, given what is happening in this world with the growth momentum we see in the U.S. will be higher next year. But the real impact the majority of the \u20ac500 million to \u20ac600 million is clearly coming from now that the investments are fully paying off and that we increase our market share. Now that already brings us almost very close to the \u20ac32 billion. I haven't talked about the FIC business because, obviously, in particular, [indiscernible] is not standing still. We have done significant investments, in particular, in Latin America, but also North America in our business. watch the credit trading business, also with the recent hires, which we have done summer last year and obviously, which we are paying off more and more. And therefore, I do believe that we have also a chance to grow there. So in this regard, that is the bridge for us from \u20ac30 million to \u20ac32 billion. Obviously, the confidence level, which James and I have and Fabrizio and Claudio is also sparked by a first good month. Now we know we cannot rest here, 1 month is 1 month. But the overall momentum in this bank to drive this, the feedback from the clients also last week in Davos is clearly telling me this is achievable, and I'm sure we can show you that already at the end of April. Second part on the share buybacks. Look, I do believe that James and I have also -- have always managed this bank in a prudent and conservative way, i.e., in particular, to your question, \u20ac1 billion to \u20ac750 million. First of all, I'm really happy with the starting point in which we start into this measurement here of 2025, 13.8% capital ratio gives us actually the ammunition, on the one hand, to grow business and have the right resources. That's all in our plans. But at the same time, obviously, also reward our shareholders. With the \u20ac750 million, which we announced and we should not forget that the 50% increase in dividends, we actually announced to the market already a distribution of \u20ac2.1 billion for this year. I think it's a wonderful starting point. And actually, if you move that up, we are now at \u20ac5.4 billion. If we think about our past, which we gave to the market in particular with regard to growing our distribution and also the dividends and you apply the next increase on the dividends for next year, you are already very, very close to the \u20ac8 billion. Now I think -- and that's what our approach is. Let us deliver on our business execution in the next month to deliver the 10% return on equity. Of course, we will review our distributions in the course of the year on the basis of our performance as, at the end of the day, we know that we also want to reward the shareholders, but I think it's a good and prudent start into the year. And let me end also with one thing, absolute confidence that we will do that what we promised to you to distribute more than \u20ac8 billion in the years '21 to '25, including the payouts in '26."

And then on the -- how should we think about it at the divisional level on how the higher cost base comes through in terms of -- also in terms of the cost-income ratio target and in comparison, you previously provided cost-income ratio target at your previous Capital Markets Day. And then just the 62.5, is that now a target that's not in reach? Or does it remain a longer aspiration, something you might potentially discuss in the course of the year. And then last question, I mean, obviously, this is a bit of a disappointment on the Q4 performance. What should give us the confidence that Q4 2025 doesn't give us a similar disappointment. And then that aspect, I think the nonoperating costs at the \u20ac400 million looks relatively low. So if you can give us a bit more confidence that really the costs, I mean ignoring FX effects you will be able to deliver them."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "It's James here. A lot to talk about, but all the right questions on the cost side for sure. So let me go in a little bit of a mixed order. On the nonoperating costs, look, start with restructuring and severance. We have a significant amount sort of I don't know practically all, but we've come such a long way in terms of the transformation of the company that there is not a great deal left to do, and we control that number. When I say not a great deal, there's still some work that Claudio and his team are doing on the private bank, you've seen that. But of course, we've taken some into Q4 to enable us to take some actions already in 2025. But for practical purposes, we're through the major transformation of the company. On the litigation side, the way I think about it is that there's a funnel of matters that can result in outflows in any given period of time. And that funnel is simply emptied. Now not in the right way. Obviously, in 2024, we had some surprises and there can always be unknown unknowns. But of the known items, the funnel is simply empty or [indiscernible] empty and the risks that we can see are remote, both in terms of time and likelihood. So we feel really good about the trajectory now on the normalization of nonoperating costs, and that counts -- that goes for Q4 next year. Obviously, we're -- we have every incentive not to deliver another quarter in which there's a kind of a messy Q4 -- another year in which there's a messy Q4. If I go to the Investor Day numbers, and this goes all the way back to 2022. But there actually, I see really good progress. So if I look to the business sort of plans for this year or the business cost income ratios in our plan, really encouraging progress. Now these weren't formal targets, but definitely a guide for you. And we see the -- both Corporate Bank and Investment Bank within the range. Corporate Bank may be towards the high end of the range, Investment Bank towards the middle of the range and asset management also very, very close to the top end of the range. So really good progress in those businesses. The Private Bank at this point will clearly be above the range. But actually, the underlying performance of the Private Bank is very encouraging in absolute terms are coming in very close to what we had factored in at the time. But there carrying the burden of really two things that some of where the incremental investment of controls and technology has gone in the years. And also as we've refined our internal cost allocations, you remember we've talked about driver-based cost management, it's tended to be shifted some of the expenses to the Private Bank. So overall, we're encouraged by what we see and there's still work to do. We don't think the trajectory for the businesses or the group ends with 2025. That gets me to your second -- to your third question, sorry. No, we're not cashiering the 62.5 forever. We think that the operating leverage that we've built and will continue to see in the company will take the cost income ratio further down in the years to come. And so we absolutely think that, that is within reach of the firm, but not in 2025. And so that then gets you to what has driven the costs up to the -- our current view of 20.3 on the old FX. Look, it's a bunch of drivers. And again, cumulatively, since the last Capital Markets Day, I would probably bucket as 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. It's sort of \u20ac600 million or \u20ac700 million over that time, if you express it in cost/income ratio terms and about 1/3 has gone into business investments, about 1/3 into control and the further 1/3 into technology, if I give you rough rough numbers, probably a little bit more weighted towards technology in that math. Now you've seen us make those decisions. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we think they are the right decisions for the company. Controls are the license to operate. And back in '22, we relatively quickly recognized we needed more investment to close out the control improvements to meet our own expectations and those of the regulators and that investment has continued. On technology, that's been sustained over the past several years. And as you know, our business very much competes on the technology that you can provide across a whole range of activities, including the client experience. And we think it's the right decision, therefore, to continue and sustain that investment. On the business side, this really goes back to the 2023 investment opportunity we saw particularly in the investment bank at the time. And we like how that investment is paying off and will pay off in the years to come. And so it's, if you like, the cumulative impact of those things that have carried into the costs for this year, if you're in the deep detail of why now and what wasn't visible to us last year, look, as we went through a planning cycle I would say, in addition to all of the above, inflation has run maybe $100 million in express just in '25 terms, higher than we might have have expected at the time. And as I say, so cumulatively, those are the drivers that have driven us to where we are now. Again, a lot of that has been offset by the very good work we've been doing under Rebecca's leadership on the efficiency program. And as Christian mentioned in his remarks, we've made enormous progress towards the \u20ac2.5 billion goal in terms of cost takeout, and there is more to come thereafter because I said in the last call, it's like peeling an onion, we see more opportunity as we get deeper into the transformation and deeper into some of the process improvements that we make."

And in that context, can you talk a little bit about your ambition in Mittelstand? And if you have factored anything for expansion Mittelstand considering this clearly some opportunities in Germany with 2 banks potentially targets in terms of Mittlestand growth from your perspective? And can you talk about what you're actually doing on the ground to grow there? Lastly, within cost and apologies it's clearly a big topic, flexibility on cost of asset before, but clearly, there's a higher cost guidance, that's a topic that we get a lot of questions on. If you can talk about flexibility in case you don't get the \u20ac32 billion plus. And if I may just ask on last question on Page 9, on your return on, I guess, risk-weighted assets by business where you give kind of the profit to risk weighted assets, very interesting chart, clearly.

        "text": "Great questions again, lots to go through there. Let me start on the easy stuff, and I'll give the harder questions. The FX impact, you're absolutely right to draw attention to it because what we wanted to do in our presentation was give you numbers that are consistent with what we've talked about for the past year. And hence, the presentation is largely -- is presented in what we would call plan FX levels, where euro-dollar was around [indiscernible]. And then we give you the translation into December FX, which was about [indiscernible]. And so that difference and creates on the revenue side, a number where $2 billion translates to about \u20ac32.8 billion. And on the expense side, as you say, 20.8 translates to 21.2. In the relationship between euros and dollars, dollar strengthening actually helps our margin just a little bit. And here, I refer to you to the currency breakout of revenues, expenses on Page 36, where you can see that there's a little bit of asymmetry in dollar euro, where we have more revenues than expenses expressed in dollars, and that drives, therefore, just a little bit of FX improvement on the margin. Now that relationship will change over the course of the year. So we'll continue to give you reporting that shows the year-on-year variances created by FX. One of the reasons we're talking about absolute numbers is always challenging given that change. And just to complete the picture, in case the question comes up, we do hedge the sterling risk. You'll see that there's also an asymmetry in sterling. We hedge that forward. It's rolling, so it's not forever. But the euro-sterling currency differences don't really change the in-year number is a great deal. Kian, you had a follow-up?"

        "text": "Looking on the Mittelstand [ph] Germany -- sorry, I was on mute. On the Mittelstand, Germany, a very good question. Look, there are 3 or 4 areas where we are obviously enhancing our business and also making sure that our portfolio with the Mittelstand not only growing, but the profitability of the portfolio, like indicated by the way, on Page 9 is further improving. Number one, we are going through this portfolio also from an SBA point of view. Clearly, one where we can do better, where we have done already action. And in particular, here, where our underlying process, which is also part of Page 9, i.e., how do we set up this bank front-to-back processes in the lending business making sure that we don't have different processes for the various financing or payment flows that we are streamlining this. This is one area where actually a lot of investments of the Corporate Bank going into the setup into the platform and the streamlining the German setup. So it will add just from an efficiency point of view, we will see a very positive impact there. Number two, of course, with the focus on the corporate bank in 2019, we also -- and I can say that here also with a little bit of pride, we absolutely regain credibility and trust in the German home market. And if I look at our market shares in not only obviously the DUCs company, but in the Mittelstand, be it the bigger family-owned companies, the Mittelstand itself, but also in the small business areas, we have actually gained momentum. We increased the revenues because the clients are feeling that Deutsche Bank wants to do that business. That was different before 2018. And with the constant improvements also process-wise, we obviously succeed. Thirdly, we have invested into our coverage. For Germany, if you want to really bank it in the best way, you need to be regionally. We have invested into our people here in order to make sure with the right coverage. And fourthly, yes, you alluded to that. Now obviously, I'm not talking in detail about that, but each situation in the industry is providing a huge opportunity. There is uncertainty in the market, you know what I'm talking about. And that obviously is a chance and opportunity for us, and we have started to work on this, and I'm sure more to come. So Mittelstand, Germany, is from a profitability point of view, efficiency point of view and from a growth, absolutely a focus. And let me also say, because I'm sure I'll get the next question, but we are not doing that at any price. We also need to take into account the situation, the economy. And therefore, we will not alter our underwriting standards because that would bite us and therefore, we keep the underwriting standards which we had. But doing this, we can see a clear growth here at home."

        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "Kian, maybe just very briefly on you're pointing to Slide 9, the chart on the right. It's what we can now work with over the next several years in a more fine-tuned way than previously, with each of the businesses looking at the drivers of their SBA or profitability against the resources that they deploy. It means we can grow revenues through things like repricing and just business growth. We can manage the expenses down, leveraging some of the tools we've built over the years, including driver-based cost management. And we can also work with the businesses to reduce the capital burden and there the efforts we've gone to create resources efficiency on the RWA side is also helping. To give you an example of where we are using these tools to make decisions, we talked about the mortgage product and especially in our home market and the deemphasis over the past couple of years of that product. It's part because at various prices, the product didn't meet its hurdles. Middle market lending equally in Germany is something we need to improve the profitability of, as Christian says, it's strategically critical. It needs to sort of carry itself from a profitability perspective as well. There are other portfolios all around the company that we're working with the businesses very closely on. And the level of engagement in this work is extremely high, which is -- which gives us a lot of optimism about how these levers can be pulled over the next several years to drive a very significant impact in bringing each of the units up and also the average."

        "speaker": "Flora Bocahut",
        "text": "The first question I wanted to ask is actually a clarification, regarding the buyback, the \u20ac750 million that you announced today, just to understand when you intend to launch that buyback. Are we talking just a few days? Or are we talking several months before this gets launched? And then on the questions, first is actually coming back to the CET1 trajectory and distribution plans. And thank you, Christian, for clarifying how the performance is going to play into potentially more distribution. But I also wanted to draw the attention on the regulatory risk here because my understanding is that the Basel IV first time implementation is now expecting to cost you just \u20ac5 billion additional RWA, so not the \u20ac7.5 billion that had initially been guided. Obviously, this discussion ongoing on whether FRTB implementation in Europe is going to be delayed. I know no decision has been made yet, but assuming this would get delayed by another year, could that mean also upside risk to your distribution plans for 2025 beyond the actual performance itself? And then a word on provisions that we haven't discussed too much yet. I think the guidance you provide for 2025 points to \u20ac1.4 billion to \u20ac1.6 billion of provisions. Consensus is right in the middle at \u20ac1.5 billion. So just if you could discuss where is the risk on that number, whether to the upside or the downside, what gives you the confidence, the visibility on that number with a special word also, if you can, on the U.S. commercial real estate portfolio, especially U.S. offices after the Fed is more likely now to keep rates higher for longer?"

        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "Also great questions. And for the others, I won't say great questions again. So don't be insulted if I don't repeat that. So briefly on the start of the buyback program. Look, every year, we start with the buybacks that offset employee share deliveries against previous year compensation. So it actually takes a little while until we complete that and so we would only start the \u20ac750 million once that is done. It takes a little bit of time, but we're in the market really for most of the first quarter with the former buyback. As is last -- was the case last year, I can see some of this amount slipping into the early part of Q3, but we would expect to get the bulk of it done earlier than that. On the -- I'll talk about the trajectory on CRR3. Look, it's more or less where we thought it'd be. And yes, there are a bit still to come. So there's a bit of a round trip in the first quarter. Because in the technical details of CRR3, the OpRisk RWA doesn't hit you January 1, but only really moderately first. But the net number of about 15 basis points down, there's a -- it's about 5 basis points up in our estimates on January 1 and then 20 basis points to come on OpRisk RWA. There are some modest adjustments also in and credit risk that come into it. That trajectory is encouraging. But as Christian says, we need to kind of seeing how the year develops and actually, the calculations are relatively new and fresh. And so it will take time for the systems, the models and what have you to settle a little bit, and we'll be back to you. On FRTB, that is an opportunity. Naturally, we need to plan with the expectation that, that will be implemented in January of next year, and we would stick with the estimate of around really \u20ac7.5 billion of impact in RWA from the first of the year, '26. I think there's a decent likelihood it will be delayed just because I think we all believe and so does some of the legislators that creating a competitive disadvantage for the European banks in this area, waiting until FRTB implementation comes to the United States and the U.K. would be unnecessarily damaging. And hence, we do think that's an opportunity. And at a point in time where it's more certain, it can enter into our capital trajectory and thinking. I would add that there's some other potential changes in our requirements going forward that can impact, say, MDA. And then lastly, on CLP, it's a relatively wide range. I think if you asked us today, we'd probably stay closer to the top end of the range, given that we still have to see, as you say, commercial real estate, the moderation take place, we're looking at the domestic middle market portfolio, as we've talked about in the past, in the economic environment that's still uncertain. But we do and hence, the confidence about moderation, we do think we're at the back end of this credit cycle. So from what we see today, we're quite confident about the improvement. \u20ac1.6 billion, so the high end would represent about 33 basis points, which as you know from our prior years and also prior guidance, would be relatively at a higher end for us. But obviously, there's a lot still to kind of water to pass under the bridge between now and the end of the year. Hopefully, that covered all your questions, Flora."

Again, we'll have to see how that plays out both in each of the quarters and the year. Hence, we gave you quarterly guidance rather than the full year, but just the widest end of the range, therefore, would be the -- ends of the range of \u20ac1.4 billion to \u20ac1.6 billion. Incidentally, actually, just to come back on one thing, Flora, you're right. We looked at the consensus and really consensus is in line with our guidance and thinking on most line items, of which credit loss provisions is one. Obviously, the cost is another prior to any adjustment for FX, as Ken pointed out. And the gap is really on revenues."

Can you elaborate on this, what do you mean did I understand it correctly? And then secondly, on the Private Bank on Slide 4. I appreciate you are on the journey but still 5% ROE is still incredibly low. What -- for retail bank in Europe, it should be at least be double. What do you have in mind? And what complete actions are you taking to significantly boost the RoTE here?"

And that, therefore, drives our views on the level of CET1 that we need to run at with an appropriate buffer against that. And of course, the 13.8% is a good place to be in that regard. There will be some changes, as we talked about FRTB denominator impact, but also potentially some changes in MDA. One example would be our OSII positioning might take a year. But given our relative score in terms of G-SIFI ness, call it, we would expect to be coming down in our G-SIB over time as an example. The second is inside our numbers, you have the mortgage sectoral buffer, which is already -- which is also impacting how we're capitalized. So my point is that the level of capitalization that we operate at now and the gap to MDA that's implied by it is a conservative point, let's put it that one on both numbers."

        "text": "On the private bank, first of all, you're right. I mean, a 5% RoTE, obviously, not sufficient at all. But therefore, we are doing this full transformation. And by the way, if we digest and really divide the private bank, the real challenge, which we are working on in Retail Germany. Now when you look at the levers, first of all, at the start, we see a good revenue momentum in the private bank, by the way, also in Retail Germany. So overall, the private bank will go by approximately \u20ac400 million year-over-year. Secondly, one of the largest cost takeouts also in absolute numbers is next year again in the Private Bank in Germany or that what James also said, where we put restructuring costs for the further fallout, so to say, in a positive way from the IT technology transfer from Postbank to Deutsche Bank is paying off. So also there from a cost point of view, it's another and not only low 3-digit million number where actually, Claudio is reducing costs in the private bank. And thirdly, James gave you another example from an RoTE point of view, we have certain portfolios or some portfolios in the private bank, where from an SBA methodology, we are simply not rewarding our shareholders. And at the end of the day, our capital in a sufficient way. And that is the third lens where with repricing, but also with reallocating capital, we are improving the picture. One bit only that you also see there is full attention on, and we are working on it. If you just look at Q4 2024 and you look at Claudio's private bank costs versus Q4 2023, we had a reduction of 9%. That shows you that there is full focus on that transition that we know we need to get the cost down. The plans are there. Implementation is underway. But fortunately, it's not only that, it's revenues and SBA."

Obviously, also the largest numbers of people where with streamlining the processes going more into a digital offering, in particular, in the retail bank. You see most of the transformation and also the efficiency gains in the Private Bank.

        "text": "Just two, I guess, sort of modeling questions left for me. Firstly, on the growth in FIC, so if I take the guidance, the \u20ac200 million or so growth that you're guiding to for FICC in 2025 how does that shake out in terms of financing versus nonfinancing? If I look at solid performance in Q4 financing revenues, if I just sort of run rate that through 2025, that's obviously imperfect, but that would sell for effectively all of the \u20ac200 million increase year-over-year in the guidance. So just any kind of color you can give in terms of FIC growth on our line line basis? And then secondly, deposit growth was quite strong in the Private Bank in Q4. So what are you assuming in terms of deposit growth in 2025 within that \u20ac300 million banking NII guidance?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "So Chris, the FIC financing revenues are in the more predictable revenue stream bucket, so the 40% in Christian's Slide 7, so contributing to that \u20ac800 million. FIC market, to your point, would be the \u20ac200 million or \u20ac300 million of contribution in the -- in what we characterize as the remain revenue streams. In FIC financing, however, there's -- as you know, it splits between carry and revenues. We're quite encouraged given the 12% growth we had now just in the fourth quarter about our ability to continue growing that revenue stream. So it should do at least \u20ac100 million, maybe some more in NII and then earn additional fees, I would think, fee growth. But just to clarify, in the buckets, the rest of FIC markets, so rates, credit and emerging markets would -- and FX would be the balance of the remaining revenue stream number. In terms of deposit growth, we've seen quite strong deposit growth. And actually, what's been encouraging is it has shifted back into site deposits from term. And that's, as we talked about, being helpful for the margin on the deposit side. We are expecting considerable growth in both of the deposit businesses in 2025. I can't give you precise numbers. But we see liquidity in the marketplace and the ability to put on liabilities at attractive prices and SBA. The one caveat I do want to mention, though, is we talked last quarter about a couple of relatively concentrated deposit levels. So we're sort of -- as those wind down, we are offsetting the runoff of a couple of concentrated deposits. And hence, you'll see the net of those 2 in the numbers over the course of the year. Also Q4, as we had a year -- actually 2 years ago, represents a relatively high print. So I would see us sort of recovering to the Q4 level over the course of Q1, maybe into Q2 and then more of that growth flowing through into the back half of the year."

There's quite a lot of M&A activity these days in European Asset Management between BNP and [indiscernible], Texas and [indiscernible]. Does that change anything in the way that you look at your asset management strategy, please? And then would you actually be willing to consider M&A? And then just two number questions, please. The first on market risk-weighted assets. From what you say about the trajectory in the fourth quarter, it seems that your market risk-weighted assets must now be around \u20ac19 billion or maybe even a bit lower, which I think is the lowest level since you started disclosing this. Is there any possibility that this is snapping back? Or is there something more structural at work here? And finally, you mentioned not only this time, but also previously that you have benefited from credit hedges. So some of your credit loss provisions have been offset by revenue elsewhere. Can you maybe give us a rough sense of how much revenue was actually generated from these hedges in 2024, please? And in which line items which revenue line items, we would find them."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "Thanks for the question, Stefan. Just briefly, we love our asset management business. We think DWS is really well positioned in today's markets. And having now exceeded the \u20ac1 trillion or dollar level, we can see that it has scale and profitability and also growth prospects. And so while we obviously see what's going on strategically in the market around us, we think we're well positioned. On the market risk RWA side, you're absolutely right, $19 billion is correct and it represents a relatively low level. Two reasons. One is year-end is often just like seasonally below. And secondly, you will have seen in the VAR numbers relatively low VAR, some of which reflects the volatility in the market and not so much the book. And hence, we would expect some amount of recovery, if you like, or an increase in market risk RWA during the course of the year. As it relates to the credit hedges, I need to double check the number, but it's sort of orders of magnitude around $100 million, a little bit more, I think, in the businesses, mostly reflected in remaining income in the businesses. And some in interest income. So a bit of a split depending on whether you see it in the investment bank or the corporate bank. And those hedges, we've talked about, I think, $42 billion of total sort of, if you like, hedges. Those hedge volumes, we well, we'll look to grow from here given what we say, I said about SRTs and the market availability. But these are ongoing programs that we have. So you can assume that type of protection and probably growing from here. Going forward, we manage concentration risks as well as capital usage with instruments."

        "text": "Two, please. follow-ups. Firstly, you said that there are 2 areas of investment in your earlier commentary. One was the tech controls and remediation. The other was growing the franchise beyond the initial revenue ambitions. And I think you have given us a few points of where that has been over the course of the call, but perhaps you can just give more granular examples of which areas you have expanded beat on your initial ambitions. And given you haven't changed the revenue guidance the $25 million, but you have the costs, what is the payback period on those investments. Do you think you're going to see that come through in '26, '27, that would be useful. And then my second question is just on that revenue bridge. Thank you for the very granular answer you gave earlier around the core divisions and see how that adds up to \u20ac2 billion. But at the same time, James also gave guidance on the corporate center or \u20ac200 million loss per quarter, which would see suggest you would have much lower revenue contribution from the corporate center, given how much that contributed in Q2 and Q3 of '24. So what's the offset there?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "Thanks, Andrew. I think it was slightly distinct the line, but I hope I caught everything. So in reverse order, the corporate center, and I think something interesting to point out on Page 5 of the deck, we talked in earlier quarters that there can be some volatility that's created by the corporate center. But I'd said at the time that it ultimately typically nets to 0 over the course of the year. And that was the case in '24, and we expect it to be the case in '25. So at the very bottom of the chart on the left, you can see that's our current expectation, but some of it is hard to predict, given, for example, valuation and timing differences are market related. But hopefully, that's a good indication. On the cost side, the walk I gave earlier to say it was about 1/3 of each of business investments, technology and controls was sort of a multiyear view going from our last Investor Day. More recently, what has been the places where we've put additional investment. I'd say the corporate bank, probably the first destination in terms of some plans that we've actually been working on for some time, but now have decided to implement, which is actually relatively broad-based in the corporate bank, but as an acceleration of some hiring and also technology investments that David Linn and his team have identified and are ready to execute and have begun the execution of -- in Private Bank, there are some technology investments that we had been kind of waiting to make decisions on, but feel are important to make, again, to keep pace with the industry where, as you can all see, in your own, I'm sure, personal lives, there's a bit of an arms race going on in terms of the capabilities for digital banking as well as some of the physical infrastructure there and then a little bit sort of a reacceleration of hiring on the RM side in that business. And then lastly, we've talked about O&A. We've -- I think we've largely completed the build-out of O&A, but there are a handful of additional hires that we've made and we've talked about also on the FICC market side, again, all of which we see as supportive of revenue, not just in '25, but in the years beyond. And so I just do want to emphasize that management's decision-making as we went through this most recent plan cycle has been not just about supporting performance in '25, but making sure we're building the company to be sustainably profitable and growing in profitability. In the years beyond, which actually one last thing to say. We look also at the 26 consensus where, as you can imagine, from the chart, especially Christian's Page 9 you can see an even greater divergence between what we believe the trajectory of the company is and what is currently in the consensus Mr. Coombs is still connected. Sorry, that last comment was indistinct. Can you repeat?"

That's not a given necessarily, but it's a major assumption that we need to make.

First of all, it was a good sign and good decision that there was a postponable by 1 year. actually, the level of attention at the EU commission when it comes to FRTB and providing a level playing field is higher than ever before. It's clearly on the agenda, not obviously of the banks but also of the EU commission. So obviously, I don't know whether at the end of the day, it will be implemented here and not in the U.S. But at least we have, in my view, a complete level of attention at the EU Commission to listen to us and to make sure that the level playing field is not lost on that point."

Costs we've talked about and capital is more efficient. I will say AT1 coupons higher than where we'd assumed as well. So there are a number of different moving parts from the Investor Day 2 that we can trace through. But the capital efficiency was certainly a supportive lever."

And some of the discretionary investments into growth, be it the corporate bank, be it the -- that's number one. Number 2 is on loan growth. It seems like you're seeing some improvement in period-end loan balances both in the Corporate Bank and also in the private bank. Could you talk about what you're seeing in your business? Is this just a blip, we shouldn't read too much into it? Or is this perhaps the start of a turning point?"

And then there is some additional expense that are still around remediation control improvements that we would see as not mandatory and where there would be some flexibility potentially to push out in time. So a reasonably considerable amount of pressure coming from that. I mentioned inflation, the $100 million of inflation above our expectations, sits on top of inflation that has been running sort of $300 million to $400 million for the past several years. So there's a considerable headwind from those 2 items."

We actually also see that going forward. That's clearly a business which we want to grow, I think where we have a competence like almost nobody else. And given also the international focus on this business, it's clearly growing. On the S and PV side, slightly down, excluding FX. Now on the private banking side, it is also an effect of that what we discussed before, i.e., the SVA methodology that we are not entirely happy with all subsegments of that portfolio James mentioned the mortgage portfolio, where we on purpose actually said we don't want to allocate that much capital Obviously, also the interest rate development in the run-up to 24 is obviously then also curbing demand a bit in Germany. And on the mid-cap side, -- at the end of the day, you see in this regard, a little bit of 2 different speeds. If you look at the loan demand of German corporates for investing in Germany, it's down. is clearly down, and that's also something which hopefully will be addressed when we talk about structural reforms, which are needed in Germany. But the other hand is that also German corporate is actually taking investments in order to invest internationally, that's clearly up. And that is, again, something where obviously we can position ourselves given our global approach."

And so that is, again, underscores a little bit the confidence that we have about the trajectory going forward. and the tools that we've built. Now some of that has to do with the costs, especially nonoperating costs from 2024 falling away. But a lot of it has to do with the levers for growth that Christian talked about steady kind of cumulative operating leverage across the businesses that we see. And then to your point, some amount of efficiency of the usage of the capital. We don't see though declining from here. So I just want to emphasize that if you're at around about $360 million over the years, we would -- especially given CRR3 and the other changes, that number would still grow by make up a number of $20 billion even with the efficiencies that we're putting through. So it is a significant amount of impact from operating leverage over time and all the other levers we've talked about."

    "transcript": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2025 Analyst Conference Call and Live Webcast. I am Yousaf, the Chorus Call operator. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] This conference must not be recorded for publication or for broadcast. At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Ioana Patriniche, Head of Investor Relations.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2025 results call. As usual, our Chief Executive Officer, Christian Sewing, will speak first; followed by our Chief Financial Officer, James von Moltke. The presentation, as always, is available to download in the Investor Relations section of our website, db.com. Before we get started, let me just remind you that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which may not develop as we currently expect. We therefore ask you to take notice of the precautionary warning at the end of our materials. With that, let me hand over to Christian.\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, Ioana, and a warm welcome from me. Before we turn to our performance, I want to offer my perspective on recent events. The geopolitical landscape is rapidly evolving and uncertainty and volatility are likely to stay elevated for the time being. This will likely impact the world economy. We still believe globalization will persist, but we expect to see a substantial reordering of trade corridors and supply chains, and this may accelerate some of the long-term trends we have spoken about for some time. And we are particularly encouraged to see what is happening in our domestic market with regards to fiscal changes and structural reforms leading to a much needed economic boost for Germany and Europe. All of this underscores why we believe our Global Hausbank business model and 4 strong businesses position us very well to support clients through these unsettled times. And already, since the start of the second quarter, we are seeing clients increasingly seek our expertise and advice. Now let me turn to our results. We are very pleased with a very strong first quarter performance. We delivered revenues of \u20ac8.5 billion, up 10%, a strong start towards our full year revenue objective of around \u20ac32 billion. Our cost/income ratio was 61% with adjusted costs of \u20ac5.1 billion, in line with full year guidance. Our loan portfolio quality remains solid, Stage 3 provisions are down nearly 30% year-on-year, normalizing as expected while Stage 1 and 2 provisions were higher and including overlays in this more uncertain environment. Our pretax profit of \u20ac2.8 billion was up 39% year-on-year. And with net profit of \u20ac2 billion, our return of tangible equity was 11.9% in the first quarter. Our CET1 ratio of 13.8% sets us up well for the rest of the year, both to support our clients and reward shareholders. To summarize, the start of the year was very strong. We believe that we have the right business model both to face uncertainties in the environment as well as to steer the bank towards delivery of our 2025 targets. Beyond that, we have a clear management agenda for further developing our Global Hausbank offering for our clients and sustainably increasing returns for shareholders beyond 2025, which I will talk about shortly. Let's now turn to our resilient operating performance on Slide 3. We delivered pre-provision profit of \u20ac3.3 billion, up 34% year-on-year. Revenue momentum combined with cost discipline resulted in strong operating leverage of 11% with each operating division delivering positive jaws. Revenue quality is strong, 71% came from more predictable revenue streams in the Corporate Bank, Private Bank, Asset Management and FIC Financing. Net commission and fee income increased by 5% year-on-year in line with our goals and reflecting our strategic investments. Net interest income in key banking book segments and other funding also remained resilient year-on-year. Noninterest expenses declined 2% year-on-year to \u20ac5.2 billion as nonoperating costs normalized as expected. Our progress on operational efficiencies enabled us both to deliver adjusted costs in line with plan and continue to self-finance investments. Turning to Slide 4. Let's now look at the progress with our 2025 delivery. Turning first to revenue growth. Since 2021, we have achieved a compound annual growth rate of 6.1% within our target range of 5.5% to 6.5%. Double-digit first quarter revenue growth contributed \u20ac700 million towards our target of \u20ac2 billion incremental revenues in 2025. Second, in respect of operational efficiencies, we have reached 85% of our \u20ac2.5 billion target with \u20ac2.1 billion in cost efficiencies either delivered or expected from completed measures. Third, we have made further progress with our capital efficiency measures with \u20ac4 billion of RWA reductions delivered this quarter through a combination of data and process improvements and the securitization transaction. This brings us cumulative RWA benefit to \u20ac28 billion at the high end of the bank's target range of \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion by the end of this year. We have announced capital distributions of \u20ac2.1 billion this year, including the 2024 dividend and our recently launched share buyback program. This will take cumulative capital returns to \u20ac5.4 billion since 2022, and we remain committed to surpassing our capital distribution target of \u20ac8 billion in respect of the years 2021 through 2025. Put simply, our 2025 targets are in sight. Let me now turn to our long-term management agenda on Slide 5. Our aim is to deliver a sustainable increase in returns through 3 levers: Increasing value generation for shareholders, reengineering our target operating model and reinforcing leadership. First, we will deploy a shareholder value-add methodology in our planning process and decision-making to optimize resource allocations across the group, and progress is underway. In the Private Bank, we have reduced RWA exposures in below hurdle mortgages. And in the Corporate and Investment Bank, we are undertaking client level reviews. We are also making progress in reengineering our target operating model. In the Private Bank, we continue to transform our personal banking operations by reducing branches and moving to digital channels, resulting in a planned reduction of almost 2,000 FTEs. We are transforming our Corporate Bank German platform and overhauling front-to-back processes in the Investment Bank leading to improved client experience and efficiency. Finally, we are strengthening leadership by streamlining governance structures. We have already reduced our committees, councils and internal policies by about half. This speeds up decision-making and increases accountability while maintaining a robust control environment. As promised, a few words on how we are well positioned to help navigate clients through the dynamic environment on Slide 6. In Germany and across Europe, we see fresh commitment to support growth, boost competitiveness and accelerate reform. We believe Germany's loosening of the debt break will unlock considerable investment opportunities and the proposed pension reforms are expected to boost activity in the capital markets. At the European level, we see commitments to invest in defense and infrastructure and much needed embrace of structural reforms, for example, the Savings & Investment Union and measures to boost securitization. Globally, trading patterns are shifting. Supply chains are being rewired and new partnerships and alliances are emerging. All of this plays to our strength. Clients need a partner with the expertise, financial strength, product breadth and global and local network to help them navigate this changing environment. And we aim to be that partner. As our leading franchise and diversified businesses are best placed to advise clients at European and global levels. Our Corporate Bank was voted world's best bank for corporates by clients. We combined global reach with a local presence to support multinational clients as their supply chains evolve. We are already a partner of choice with around 40% of our revenues with multinationals come from cross-regional corridors. With deep roots in Europe and in Germany's Mittelstand, we are ideally positioned to help clients benefit as fiscal stimulus feed through the real economy. Our Investment Bank is also ideally placed to help institutional and corporate clients navigate this environment. We have the leading global non-U.S. FIC franchise. We were the top-ranked European bank in global SSA issuance and in EMEA cash rates. While in Germany, we have the leading O&A franchise. And we are well positioned to support the broader German and European defense agenda, where we have the leading franchise in aerospace and defense in Germany, providing clients with holistic global coverage. We're also Germany's leading Wealth Manager and Retail Fund Manager through our Private Bank and Asset Management businesses. This positions us well to help clients capitalize on savings and investment reforms. We have already rebalanced our Wealth Management business mix, resulting in increased assets under management flows, and we continue to scale up in our core growth markets. DWS, with assets under management of over \u20ac1 trillion, record net inflows of \u20ac20 billion in the first quarter and a market share of 11% in European ETFs and is ideally placed not only to serve German and European investors, but also to act as a gateway to Europe for investors globally. To sum up, across all our businesses, we believe we are very well positioned to serve German, European and global clients in a fast-changing environment. With that, let me hand over to James.\nJames Von Moltke: Thank you, Christian, and good morning. As you can see on Slide 8, we saw strong delivery this quarter against all the broader objectives and targets we set ourselves for 2025. More importantly, we've done so without compromising on our investments, be it to support operating performance or our controls. Our capital position is robust after absorbing deductions for dividends, share buybacks and AT1 coupons and the CRR3 impact. Equally, our liquidity metrics are sound. The liquidity coverage ratio was 134% in line with our target, and the net stable funding ratio was 119% at the upper end of our target range. And while we recognize that the last few weeks have been turbulent and resulted in a significant amount of volatility and uncertainty, reflecting on the path ahead, our balance sheet remains strong. As shown on Slide 28 in the appendix, asset quality is sound. The bank's liquidity profile is strong. And together with our robust capital position and strong earnings momentum, we believe that we are well equipped to continue to support our clients globally and to provide advice and solutions as they navigate this time of uncertainty. Our prudent approach to managing our trading book also paid off in April. Our trading P&L has stood up well throughout the market volatility and developed in line with the bank's risk appetite. With that, let me now turn to the first quarter highlights on Slide 9. We've demonstrated strong franchise momentum across the bank. Investments across businesses continue to pay off, which drove a significant increase in revenues, both sequentially at 18% and year-on-year at 10%. And the balanced portfolio mix also enables us to weather times of uncertainty. Our cost/income ratio of 61.2% benefited both from our continued cost discipline and a normalization of nonoperating costs. Noninterest expenses in the first quarter are in line with our guidance for 2025. Profit generation was strong, and our post-tax return on tangible equity of 11.9% underpins the bank's ambition to deliver sustainable returns of greater than 10% in 2025 and beyond. Our tax rate in the first quarter came in at 29%. In the first quarter, diluted earnings per share was \u20ac0.99 and tangible book value per share increased to \u20ac30.43 up 4% year-on-year. Before I go on, let me add a few remarks on Corporate and Other, where you can now find further information in the appendix on Slide 39. With respect to development this quarter, C&O generated a pretax loss of \u20ac34 million, mainly from shareholder expenses and other essentially retained items, partially offset by positive revenues in valuation and timing. So let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results and start with net interest income on Slide 10. NII across key banking book segments and other funding was \u20ac3.3 billion, broadly stable quarter-on-quarter. As in prior quarters, Private Bank continues to deliver strong NII, supported by our structural hedge portfolio, while FIC financing continues to grow lending. The Corporate Bank is slightly down compared to the prior quarter, principally due to accounting reclassification effects in loan NII, which are offset in remaining income. Deposit NII was broadly flat as hedge benefits offset a reduction in policy rates and portfolio growth remained strong. With respect to the full year, in line with prior guidance, we continue to expect a material NII tailwind for the key banking book businesses and other funding versus 2024, which is principally driven by hedge rollover and deposit growth. Compared to our disclosure a quarter ago, higher long-term rate expectations, specifically in euros, increased the expected benefit of our hedge portfolio in the outer years. In the appendix on Slide 26, we illustrate the dynamics of the interest rate hedge in more detail. Turning to Slide 11. Adjusted costs were \u20ac5.1 billion for the quarter in line with our expectations. Cost discipline across the franchise remained high and materially offset an increase in compensation costs. This was driven by a higher performance-related cash accruals and increased equity compensation costs as a result of a rising Deutsche Bank and DWS share prices during the first quarter. With that, let me turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 12. Stage 3 provision for credit losses materially reduced in the first quarter to \u20ac341 million, in line with expectations. Stage 1 and 2 provisions were elevated at \u20ac130 million and included around \u20ac70 million of provisions related to the impact of weaker macroeconomic forecasts on forward-looking information as well as overlays including for direct tariff-driven impacts on select higher-risk names. The remainder was driven by model and portfolio-related effects. We feel comfortable with our underlying portfolio performance and the development of provisions that we recognize the ongoing uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment and monitor these developments closely. With that, let me turn to capital on Slide 13. Our first quarter common equity Tier 1 ratio remained strong at 13.8%. The CRR3 go-live impact was 1 basis point, since the reduction in credit risk RWA was largely offset by reductions in capital supply and an increase in operational risk RWA. Aside from the CRR3 go-live impact, risk-weighted assets increased, principally reflecting a normalization of market risk RWA, as previously guided. This increase was partly offset by a reduction in credit risk RWA as higher business growth was more than offset by capital efficiency measures, including a securitization transaction during the quarter. CET1 capital increased as the strong first quarter net income, net of AT1 and dividend deductions was offset by equity compensation, the FX impact of -- on account of the AT1 call and other capital charges. At the end of the first quarter, our leverage ratio was 4.6%, up by 1 basis point, as higher trading inventory and high-quality liquid assets were offset by higher Tier 1 capital alongside beneficial FX and CRR3 effects. With regard to bail-in ratios, we continue to operate with a significant buffer over all requirements. In short, our capital position remains strong. And with that, let us turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 15. In the first quarter, the Corporate Bank delivered a post-tax return on tangible equity of 14.4% and a cost/income ratio of 62%, despite an uncertain geopolitical and macroeconomic environment and lower interest rates. Revenues were \u20ac1.9 billion, essentially flat sequentially and year-on-year supported by interest rate hedging, higher deposit balances and growth in net commission and fee income, mostly offsetting ongoing deposit margin normalization. We continue to make good progress by further accelerating noninterest revenue development with 6% growth in net commission and fee income and benefiting from a particularly strong contribution from our Institutional Client Services business. The deposit base remained strong. Adjusted for FX movements, deposits were up by \u20ac13 billion year-on-year and by \u20ac6 billion sequentially. Provision for credit losses was contained at \u20ac77 million, including \u20ac50 million of Stage 1 and 2 provisions, of which \u20ac29 million related to net management overlays. Noninterest expenses were lower year-on-year, driven by the nonrecurrence of a litigation item in the prior year and continued tight cost management. Looking ahead, we believe that our international presence, strength in all trade corridors and strong footprint in Germany position the Corporate Bank well to support our clients on changes in trade flows and supply chains. I will now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 16. Revenues for the first quarter were 10% higher year-on-year with strength in FIC driving improvement to the division's return on tangible equity and cost/income ratios. FIC revenues increased by 17%, with both rates and foreign exchange significantly higher year-on-year, reflecting heightened market activity and increased client engagement. We continue to support our institutional and corporate clients through volatile markets and saw activity increase across both groups in the first quarter, including our priority clients. Meanwhile, we continue to advance the business strategy of developing existing and adjacent businesses. Financing revenues were also higher, reflecting strong fee income across the business, combined with an increased carry profile, following targeted balance sheet deployment in line with our strategy. The targeted deployment in the business is also reflected in the increased loan balances compared to the prior year. Moving to Origination & Advisory. Revenues were lower year-on-year due to a loss on the partial sale and markdown of a specific loan in leveraged debt capital markets as guided. Excluding this item, revenues increased 5% on a like-for-like basis compared to the prior year quarter in a fee pool that was broadly flat. Advisory revenues were significantly higher in a static industry fee pool with the business maintaining the momentum of a strong 2024. Noninterest expenses were essentially flat with higher adjusted costs, which were impacted by FX translation, offset by lower litigation and reduced severance and restructuring costs. Provision for credit losses were \u20ac163 million, with the year-on-year increase driven by Stage 1 and 2 provisions, which includes tariff-related overlays, model changes and portfolio effects, largely offset by a material reduction in Stage 3 impairments, including CRE. Let me now turn to Private Bank on Slide 17. The Private Bank achieved a 43% increase in pretax profit, reflecting 7% operating leverage driven by revenue growth and further cost benefits from progress made in our transformation initiatives. Good business momentum continued with net inflows of \u20ac6 billion and higher revenues, driven by 5% growth in net commission and fee income from investment product revenues in line with our strategy, while net interest income grew by 2%. Revenues in Wealth Management and Private Banking grew 8%, reflecting double-digit growth for investment products, mainly driven by discretionary portfolio mandates. Revenues in Personal Banking reflect our decision to reduce capital-intensive loan products such as mortgages, while revenues from deposit and investment products were up 4%, mainly from discretionary portfolio mandates. The Private Bank has continued its transformation with an additional 60 branch closures and reductions of approximately 400 FTE in the quarter, on track to achieve almost 2,000 FTE reductions as part of further restructuring efforts in Germany. Benefits from these measures, coupled with normalized investment spend, including from the Postbank IT migration, and lower regulatory costs drove adjusted costs down by 4% year-on-year. Provision for credit losses in the Private Bank was impacted by the deteriorating macroeconomic environment, while underlying portfolio performance improved. The prior year quarter was impacted by elevated provisions in Wealth Management and transitory effects from the operational backlog. We expect the Private Bank to continue benefiting from a combination of efficiency programs underway in Germany, Italy and Spain, where benefits are yet to be realized, revenue growth initiatives and optimization of capital usage by recalibrating the lending book and higher focus on capital-light solutions, which in turn will lead to sustainable profitability and annual mid-teens RoTE in the near term. Turning to Slide 18. My usual reminder, the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Asset Management delivered materially improved profitability with a 67% increase in profit before tax. This was driven by higher revenues across all streams, resulting in a materially lower cost/income ratio and an improved return on tangible equity of 22.1%. The \u20ac730 million in revenues were primarily driven by higher management fees from both active and passive products, benefiting from growth in average assets under management. The increase in performance fees was driven by the ongoing recognition of performance fees on one infrastructure fund, while other revenues benefited from a more favorable outcome of fair value of guarantees. Slightly higher costs were driven by business growth and increased equity compensation costs as a result of a rising DWS share price during the first quarter. Assets under management remained over \u20ac1 trillion with record net inflows of almost \u20ac20 billion, driven by passive products of \u20ac13 billion, offset by negative FX and market impacts. Cash, SQI and fixed income also contributed with combined further net inflows of \u20ac11 billion, overcompensating for net outflows of \u20ac3 billion in active equity, alternatives and multi-asset products. In the quarter, a new private credit partnership with the Investment Bank was launched to enhance the alternatives franchise aiming to provide prospective investors with access to this highly sought-after asset class. Finally, let me turn to the group outlook on Slide 19. In short, our outlook remains largely unchanged, and we are on course to deliver our full year targets for 2025. We are steadfast in our aim to deliver improved profitability and shareholder returns. Our strong revenue performance in the first quarter provides the step off to deliver this year's revenue goal of around \u20ac32 billion, with our complementary businesses all performing well. We remain committed to rigorous cost management while not making any compromises on controls and investments, as we continue to benefit from ongoing delivery of our cost efficiency initiatives. Our asset quality remains solid, and we continue to expect Stage 3 provisions to normalize this year. We are maintaining our full year guidance for provision for credit losses, but the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment may continue to impact model-based Stage 1 and 2 provisions. Yes, uncertainty has increased, and we need to remain vigilant. But considering our strong financial performance and levels of client activity, we remain comfortable with our trajectory to deliver an RoTE of above 10% and a cost/income ratio of below 65% in 2025, with strong operating leverage and balance sheet efficiency, supporting further improved profitability beyond 2025. Our strong capital position and first quarter results also give us a solid step off for our distribution objectives. The \u20ac750 million share buyback we announced in January is already underway and we have proposed a dividend of \u20ac0.68 per share, which brings us to \u20ac2.1 billion of capital distributions so far this year. We will assess the scope for additional distributions in 2025 and remain comfortable on outperforming our \u20ac8 billion distribution target. With that, let me hand back to Ioana, and we look forward to your questions.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you, James. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Chris Hallam from Goldman and Sachs.\nChris Hallam: I have two, both on revenues. So first, for this year, clearly, Q1 was strong run rating well ahead of the \u20ac32 billion guide. But obviously, a lot has changed in terms of the operating environment in the past few weeks. In some of the businesses, I suppose that's supported higher activity levels, but in other parts of the group, client activity would have cooled meaningfully. So how does that picture look for you across the group? And where are there, I guess, substitution opportunities for you? For example, let's say, a CapEx-related loan is delayed, but now the client needs additional short-term working capital finance. And then second, more medium term. On Slide 6, you outlined these kind of big emerging trends, which looks set to determine the competitive landscape over the coming years. I guess, simply, what gives you the confidence that following the transformation of the business, Deutsche Bank has the right footprint and the right risk and control set up to succeed against this backdrop, i.e., to take market share and to capitalize on those growth opportunities?\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, Chris. Let me take your questions first, and James should add, of course. Look, like we said in the prepared remarks with regard to the full year revenue picture and our goal and our confidence in the \u20ac32 billion, obviously, first quarter helps a lot. We outperformed not only the consensus, we, to be honest, also are ahead of our own plan in the first quarter, which gives us all the confidence that we can keep the momentum and that we will see the \u20ac32 billion also at year-end. So first quarter helps a lot. Secondly, Chris, I'm really happy with the diversification in our business. And if you really tear it apart, then you can see that many of our businesses will actually be unaffected by that what we have seen in early April or are even benefiting from that over time. We can see a very stable and continuous development in the Private Bank, very positive, stable delivery path, supported by an ongoing growth in assets under management. So I would say also with having the monthly performance review meetings with Claudio, that this is a continuous path, which we enjoy, both in Personal Banking, also with additional deposit campaigns, but in particular, in the Wealth Management business with our Investment business. Similar good momentum in Asset Management, very happy with the first quarter results. We always forgot to mention also that I really have to congratulate Stefan also for reemerging into the Amdocs [ph] with DWS. It really shows that there is momentum behind the business is very positive on the outlook. Also here, I would say, with that what we have seen in April, also with the way they have managed the performance for our clients, it's actually a very good and convincing picture. And therefore, we stay the course on Asset Management, and there is, in our view, no concern that we will miss our full year results. In the Corporate Bank, we had a little bit of a weaker start in Q1. Fortunately, we offset that with the over delivery in all the other businesses. And therefore, I'm saying we are even stronger in Q1 than our own internal plan. But the nice thing is actually that the Corporate Bank will accelerate from here. So the sequential performance, we believe that we will see slight increases in revenues quarter-over-quarter from where we are right now. We can already see also a little bit more of demand in the Credit business, in the Financing business, in the Corporate Bank. We saw it already at the end of the first quarter. Now obviously, this did not or was not fully reflected then in the P&L for the first quarter, but you could see an increase in demand at the end of the first quarter, which also gives us the confidence going forward. And linked to your second question, I will get back to that. Look, in particular, what is happening also in Germany is a huge opportunity for our Corporate Bank, and I will talk about that positioning in a bit. On the Investment Bank, to be honest, I'm super happy with our FIC business. I think, again, we have shown that not only we performed very well in Q1, but also that we took market share. If I compare that with the numbers which we have seen from our peers, Q1 was another example that Deutsche Bank took market share in the FIC business. If we go deeper into FIC, to be honest, yes, we have seen some weaker days in the first half of April. But to be honest, we are back to normal, so to say, in the second half. And the outperformance in Q1 will carry us through the year and will also carry us through the somewhat weaker days in the first half of April. So I'm honestly very happy with that business. And don't forget that in that business, in the FIC business, we have a very stable financing business, where I would even say that the opportunities, which the market now presents in the financing business, also in areas like distressed and credit trading, are actually really good. And from our capital position, the power we have to invest there, I'm actually optimistic. So in this regard, there are pockets also in FIC, where we can benefit from the situation. And again, in the second half of April, we are absolutely back to normal flow business. And that then actually remains with the question, O&A. I'm actually satisfied with Q1 in O&A. You know that we had the one markdown, which we already mentioned also to the market mid of March. Outside that, O&A actually behaved very, very strong. If I now look forward with a very robust pipeline, stronger pipeline than before, and there is no deal canceled. Yes, we see some delayed deals, but no deal is canceled. And I do believe actually that with where the markets are right now, where I do believe we move, that I can see that actually Q2, Q3 with that robust pipeline is actually enjoying quite healthy numbers in the O&A business. So all in all, looking at the outperformance in Q1, looking at the chances and opportunities we see in the Private Bank, and part of the FIC businesses, the continuous inflow on Asset Management and now the acceleration in the Corporate Bank makes me absolutely comfortable with our \u20ac32 billion revenue goal. With regard to your second question, look, I really do see for the time being 3 trends. And this is where James and I try to focus the bank on in terms of delivery and client delivery. Number one, and let me start with that, in my view, is the global volatility, uncertainty clearly also with our clients. But here, the concept of the Global Hausbank is working. And we said it in the previous quarters and again in Q1, but also in particular in April, we can see that the demand for advice, the demand of a global bank with a global network is higher than ever before. And I also see actually that a lot of clients, and we even have tangible examples in the O&A business, in the Corporate Bank business where clients want to actually see the European alternative to the U.S. banks, in particular, in a world which is more fragmented than before. So the setup as the Global Hausbank, with strong roots here in our home market, clearly helps us. Secondly, I have been on the record with supporting statements of that, what we will see from the new coalition. I do think that Germany can digest actually the additional debt, which you intend to take on in order to do investments. There are huge opportunities to leverage that with private debt, to leverage that with financings. And that's actually what we started to see at the end of March. And therefore, we're saying we see in the Corporate Bank that there is a trend with regard to financing, which goes into the right direction. And I do believe if the government is taking the right decisions over the next 3 months, and you have heard actually Friedrich Merz that he is intending to take some accelerated decisions before the summer break. That will be actually very good for the atmosphere, for the psychology in the country, for the consumption in the country, and obviously, we will benefit from that in the various business lines. Thirdly, we should not forget all the acceleration also when it comes to Capital Markets Union or better said, Savings & Investment Union in Europe. Again, the focus is on banks with the capital markets business. We have seen the reallocation of funds already to Europe over the last weeks. We have clearly seen that also in our flows. And to be honest with that, what is happening in Brussels, together with that, what is happening in Germany, I think we are rightly placed to benefit from that. All that with the outperformance in Q1 makes me really confident that we can achieve our goals and that we will achieve our goals on the revenue side but also on the profitability side.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan.\nKian Abouhossein: First question is regarding the comment around FIC slowdown. Can you just put that in context? In April, you mentioned that, I think on Bloomberg and Christian, you just mentioned that as well. Could you just put it in context of what time frame you're comparing? And secondly, in that context, just tell me what subsegments of FIC are weaker? Is it credit? Is it rates? Maybe even by geography, if possible, just so we get an idea and if this is just an immediate reaction of what happened in the market post tariffs? Or if it's an ongoing issue that we should think about in our modeling? And then the second question is regarding your outlook. GDP, U.S. assumption 1.7%, China 4.5%. Just wondering if these numbers, what would happen if there would be significantly lower because they look a bit on the higher end of what market consensus expectation or forward curves are assuming. If you could discuss that relative to your 10% RoTE plus target and issues around that if we should think about -- if it could have a negative impact, so to say?\nJames Von Moltke: Sure. Thanks, Kian. I'll start on the fixed guidance that we've given or commentary about the market. Look, I think one important thing is to say is that the second half of April, and it isn't precisely in halves, but I think the easiest way to think about it is second half of April, resumed a pattern that looked very much like what you see in the disclosure on daily trading results in the FIC business for much of the first quarter. So to your question about ongoing, it isn't a concern for us at the moment at all. In fact, I think we're well positioned to recapture the foregone revenues from the first half of April, as in the balance of the quarter. In fairness, we're actually up year-on-year still in April. So we look at this with sort of a relaxed view. Naturally in markets that are as turbulent as the ones we experienced in the first couple of weeks of April, you're going to see some correlations break down some impact on the books. But we were reasonably happy. So there was, of course, a slowdown in a few weekdays, but we were happy with how the desks performed in that environment, the way we were able to stand in to provide liquidity for clients, pricing, what have you. In terms of the products, it was a little sort of varied around the world. But to your point, credit struggled more, and there were elements of -- in the rates and FX complexes where again, correlations moving created some disturbance. What's interesting is how quickly and almost fully the markets have recovered over the course of April. Again, going to your question about is it an ongoing concern? As we sit here today, really, it's not. And actually, I've been positively impressed by the way in which investors have continued to be engaged in the environment that we have, which is reasonably fast moving. In terms of the outlook, lots of our assumptions are driven by macroeconomic variables, and I'll focus on revenues and expenses. And naturally, we look at downside scenarios. And that was the principal driver, of course, of the overlay that we took in provisions in Q1. We think that overlay was prudent and appropriate and actually reflects how the macroeconomic consensus has moved since the end of March. So we feel quite comfortable with how, if you like, first quarter reporting reflects our outlook as well as the consensus environment today. The other thing, just more broadly to the question you asked and really Christian's response to Chris's question, we see a lot of, what I'll call, sort of portfolio effects in our businesses. So businesses that are maybe negatively affected by certain elements of the macro environment will be offset by others that are benefited. And so it isn't at all linear. And we feel like the balance of risks and opportunities that we see in the market really underscores our outlook, as Christian just mentioned. And hence, we're feeling pretty good about the overall macro environment even as it's changed since the beginning of the year when we last spoke.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nicolas Payen, Kepler Cheuvreux.\nNicolas Payen: Two questions, please. One on distribution and one follow-up on CLP please. The first one on distribution. You mentioned that you were continuing to assess the scope for additional share buybacks. So I wanted to ask you whether you have started discussions with the regulator regarding second tranche of buybacks and if we could have any indication regarding the potential size of the second tranche? And is there any particular indicator that you and the regulators are looking at to be able to launch that second tranche? On CLP, so you just mentioned overlays on tariffs, so is it possible to know what was the size of this overlay? And what are the underlying assumptions that you are taking regarding the tariff impact and the whole tariff situation? And with the development situation that we see on the CLP front, how does it impact your full year guidance? Is it -- are we still on track for the \u20ac350 million to \u20ac400 million per quarter that you mentioned earlier?\nChristian Sewing: Thank you, Nicolas. Look, on the distribution, I stay to that what I said and what we said end of January because that was a clear outlook statement that, a, obviously, we have the approval for the \u20ac750 million, which started -- where we started the program early April. And then we clearly said that we want to deliver 2 quarters where we show that we are on track for our 10% RoTE. Now we are very happy with that what we have seen in Q1. You have heard from our kind of outlook statements, which we just reiterated that we remain comfortable on the 10%. And then we will reassess during the second quarter, obviously, the possibility of a second buyback, and we'll then start the discussions. But I would find it not fair actually if, on the one hand, I'm doing a clear statement in January and saying, I measure myself and we measure ourselves against the first 2 quarters and then I change track. Obviously, the outlook in the overall economy changed, we have shown that we can deal with that. We have shown that we have laid a very solid foundation, we are at 13.8%. And therefore, I feel overall pretty good about all this. But now we are focusing on delivery of a strong Q2. And then I'm sure we will reassess and have the discussion with our regulators.\nJames Von Moltke: And Nicolas, on the CLP side, it's very nuanced, but the easiest way to think about it is that the overlay represents about \u20ac70 million broken into 2 parts. One is as I just -- part of the answer to Kian's question is, we put it -- we assumed a set of macroeconomic variables that were more pessimistic than what were present in the market in March, and that represented about \u20ac50 million of the \u20ac70 million. And essentially, the consensus is caught up with that level. So we feel good that, that was appropriately calibrated. So \u20ac50 million on macroeconomic variables reflected in a forward-looking indicator overlay. And about \u20ac20 million reflecting what I'd call collective staging. So we've been looking not just recently, but for the past couple of quarters, either at sectors or individual obligors particularly exposed to tariffs. And that can be based on their own export activity, their supply chain, what we think the competitive environment for their business might be and how it will be affected by tariffs and so on. And so we took some actions around collective staging, and that represents really the other \u20ac20 million. To be fair, there's probably some amount in what I would think of as the baseline. So the rest of it is about \u20ac400 million. There's some of that \u20ac400 million actually would also reflect tariff-related impacts that have been sort of bleeding in as individual credit decisions for obligors are reflected, but the easiest way to think about it is \u20ac400 million run rate, which is in line with our guidance, and we always expected the first quarter to be a little higher than the rest of the year and \u20ac70 million of overlay broken out, as I described. As to the guidance, look, the wide end would have been about \u20ac1.6 billion. We note that consensus is a little higher than that already. And we think based on how Stage 3 is -- has developed, and we now see the evidence of that normalization that we called for. We think that's entirely reasonable -- would kind of imply about \u20ac375 million per quarter from here, which, absent a deterioration of macroeconomic variables, would be entirely achievable and to be expected, hence, sticking with the guidance.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matthew Clark [ph] from Mediobanca.\nUnidentified Analyst: So a few questions. Firstly, thanks for the commentary on April, from a P&L perspective in FIC. I'm just wondering, should we be worried about a risk-weighted asset impact from Value-at-Risk reaches or counterparty risk or liquidity drawdowns by customers or anything like that? Would you expect a material impact in the second quarter that could possibly affect your second buyback decision? That's the first question. Second question is on the U.S. commercial real estate outlook. Christain, I think you gave some fairly constructive comments at the conference in the middle of March, a lower -- sorry, a higher rate trajectory didn't affect your expectations there. I was just wondering if you could give us an update whether there's been a significant change since then, whether you've reassessed your \u20ac0.5 billion stress loss for the commercial real estate portfolio. And then final question is just on when we can expect some more concrete targets for future years rather than simply a continuous improvement? Do we need to wait until next year when the CFO succession process has played out before that can come? Or can you give us something more concrete or can we expect something more concrete before then?\nJames Von Moltke: Thanks, Matthew. So market risk RWA, interesting question. There is, of course, a risk, but we think we've managed that down. So the VaR outliers, we haven't triggered at this point over the threshold at which sVaR outliers would produce an increase in market risk RWA. And you've -- the sVaR did tick up at the beginning of the month, and we've managed that down through hedging and portfolio actions. So those risks are there in a -- if the market were to become disrupted later in the quarter, but we think the impact of what was present in the market in the first half of April has been managed. And at the moment, we don't see that presenting itself. On the CRE side, it's interesting. The market indicators are a little bit mixed. So office in the index is slightly down, I'll call it, flat. Leasing activity has actually ticked up, which is good. And of course, rates and sponsor behavior have, while they've moved around, largely unchanged. So our outlook for CRE continues to be where it was beginning of the year. We would see a steady improvement from the levels that we show you in Q1. In fact, there was only one new default in CRE in office in the U.S. this quarter. So what you have is essentially 100% of the provision associated with valuation adjustments on existing defaulted positions. And hence, I think we get closer to the point where you see a more dramatic decline in the provision levels. As you say, we're tracking a little bit closer sort of every quarter to the severe stress, but we don't see anything that would suggest another leg down in CRE, we're still in line with our earlier expectations.\nChristian Sewing: And Matt, from a numbers point of view for the outer years and our plan going forward. Of course, you will get something during this year. But as I said before, I think it's important for us that we deliver very solid numbers for the first half year. And obviously, James and his successor will then work together with me on those numbers because I want to have an absolutely smooth handover. I want to make sure that there is a fully aligned process. I think, that is what management is all about. And I'm really happy with that how we have set it up. But you can be rest assured that numbers will be given to you in the second half of 2025.\nUnidentified Analyst: By implication, does that mean with third quarter results, just of -- the new guys joining in September?\nChristian Sewing: Look, I said in the second half of 2025. And we have lots of things to do now. And I'm not yet deciding on the exact date, but you will receive in the second half of 2025 a good set of outlook numbers for the oncoming years from us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stefan Stalmann from Autonomous.\nStefan Stalmann: I wanted to clarify one of your comments, please, James. You mentioned that fixed income trading was still up year-on-year in April. Does that literally mean April year-on-year? Or does it mean year-to-date up in fixed income for the full 4 months? And the second question is about the increase in compensation expenses that you flagged that is coming partly from the rise in your share price. The DWS did mention that they are hedging this effect to some degree. Are you also doing this at Deutsche Bank level? And if so, was there any positive benefit from this in one of the revenue items and if so, where? And the final question I wanted to ask, please, is on the NSFR ratio, and in particular on the dollar-based NSFR ratio, which received a bit of attention recently with the EBA report. Could you give us a rough indication of where your dollar NSFR ratio sits, the EBA said that German banks on average were at 76%. Can you give us an indication where you are, please?\nJames Von Moltke: Thanks, Stefan. So the answer is both on FIC revenue. So we are obviously up big year-on-year in the first quarter. We're up slightly in April, in the month of April, and therefore, we remain up significantly year-on-year, year-to-date in FIC. And that's encouraging to see how the franchise strength, the investments that we've talked about, client engagement, all of those things sort of playing out as we hoped and have been -- and Ram and his team have been working to for such a long time. So it's encouraging development. And to the earlier question, if the market tone stays as it has been now in the second half of April and in the first quarter, we'd certainly recapture the weakness in the early days of April. On the compensation expenses, at the end of the day, it falls through to the expense line on a consolidated basis. Essentially, the group offers DWS some benefit of hedging that risk. It transfers and creates a revenue item for DWS that's then eliminated on consolidation at the group level, but the compensation cost impact shows up at the group on a consolidated basis. And actually, it represents year-on-year, a decent size of the increase. If I break the compensation numbers up, it's basically 4 parts, all about equal between \u20ac30 million and \u20ac40 million. Foreign exchange translation, the stock impact, variable compensation and then the net impact of fixed pay coming through, which we think is a good outcome, especially as a lot of that was then offset in non-comp expenses. On the NSFR, we wanted to tip our hat to the question that was raised in the EBA report. So on Page 28, we show you a number of more than 90% of our U.S. dollar asset side being funded by native U.S. dollar liabilities. Now NSFR by its definition doesn't include cross-currency funding, which is just a quirk or a feature of it. Including cross-currency funding, we'd be above -- safely above 100% on -- and we think our dollar liquidity position is extremely strong because essentially, the liabilities fund, a balance sheet that is, I'll call it, 80% loan-to-deposit and a significant amount of cash and high-quality liquid assets in dollars. If anything, our dollar funding is more robust than other currencies. So we saw that, and I think, hopefully, have provided with that one data point, a good response. I will say, and we maybe come up to this tomorrow on the fixed income call, there's a lot of I'll say, technology, limits, controls, maturity ladders and what have you that we apply to managing currency risks and the funding implications of currency risk on the balance sheet. So we think we've got a very, very strong, robust set of capabilities there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Flora Bocahut from Barclays.\nFlora Bocahut: The first question I wanted to ask is on the cost guidance. You've obviously started well here in Q1 on the cost base. And you have, I think, 18% of your cost base in U.S. dollar, assuming the euro dollar remains where it currently is around 1.14, this should have I think, around 1% positive impact on your cost base year-on-year. So I'm just asking, is there -- would you say there is positive risk to your cost guidance for this year? Or not really because despite the good Q1, despite the FX tailwinds here, you think this could be offset somewhere else by the end of this year? The second question is on O&A revenues. I see you've dropped the guidance of the plus \u20ac600 million you expected for this year. I think it's clear what you've explained already on this call. Maybe just to ask, do you still think nevertheless, that you could expect an increase year-on-year or it could be flat or down? Just to help us frame the range of outcomes here, considering current market conditions, but also your pipeline?\nJames Von Moltke: Thanks, Flora. So on reported expenses, yes, the current FX rate would represent, if you like, however you think about it, put downward pressure on the reported expenses. You've seen that year-on-year in the first quarter, kind of the average was a \u20ac52 million upward movement in reported expenses that would flip around next quarter to some degree, depending on the path of the exchange rate. Remember, though, that because we have U.S. dollar revenues, it neutralizes more or less in pretax profit and in the ratios. There's a little bit of, I'll call it, tracking error, but by and large, the U.S. dollar nets out when you get to cost/income ratio, pretax profit and RoTE.\nChristian Sewing: Flora, to your second question on O&A revenues. Yes, we do believe that here, if we compare 2025 with 2024 that we will see an increase in O&A despite of that what we see in the markets right now. Therefore, again, I think it's really important to look at the probability weighted pipeline, which is still very robust. Also at the comment I made before that we haven't seen any canceled deals that we actually have seen a very nice development on the mandates, which we received. And therefore, if I take now Q1, if I look at the pipeline and the work we are doing on Q2. To be honest, I'm very confident that we will see O&A revenue numbers, which are ahead of last year. And again, given the diversification we have in the business is also the compensating business areas, even if we have a weakness in O&A versus our initial plan. We believe that this will be offset by other businesses and we have the really good cushion, which we have already established in Q1.\nJames Von Moltke: Just one thing to add, Flora, on that is that the guidance is, of course, an update with Q1 behind us. And hence, the guidance reflects also that LDCM mark in it. And so I think it's an encouraging thing to see O&A up more than overcoming what was a relatively significant one-off item in the first quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Anke Reingen from RBC.\nAnke Reingen: My first is on Personal Banking. The headwind you saw in the quarter from the run-off of the capital intense loan products. Should we expect that to continue? Or is the review completed with Q1? And then on the costs, I mean you say comp is up 5% year-over-year, but I just wonder about the noncomp, which obviously implies a quite good performance in the quarter. Is Q1 a run rate here? Or is it really quite low and should pick up in the course of the year, but then any uptick should be compensated by lower compensation expenses? If you can please comment.\nJames Von Moltke: Thank you, Anke. So just to make sure we heard your comments orally, but question one, so we had about a \u20ac2 billion runoff in mortgages in the quarter, which was relatively significant. And given kind of our strategic view as well as the decision to close the DSL channel, I think you'd expect to see some of that also persist in the year. Now again, our outlook statements about Private Bank are, I would say, bullish that we still see continued growth in the coming quarters. And so that would incorporate additional runoff of what we think of as capital-intensive portfolios. On the cost side, there was nothing special necessarily in the non-comp in Private Bank in the first quarter. We did have restructuring and severance, as you saw, most of the restructuring and severance charge that we took at the group level in the first quarter was in PB. We would expect that to lessen as the year goes by, maybe some more in Q2, but less in the second half of the year. There can be some seasonality in things like marketing expense and what have you. But by and large, what we'd expect to see is the continued impact over the coming quarters and into the subsequent years of the benefits of the sort of cumulative restructuring steps that we've taken around particularly branches, personnel, but also the impact now of more fully the benefits of the technology investments we've made in the past.\nChristian Sewing: I just wanted to support that, Anke, because I'm really happy with what I'm seeing now in the Private Bank. I think we are really seeing the fruits of all the transformation and restructuring. Also, by the way, of all the work we have done on Unity. And you know how painful that was. And also with the pain we, in particular, took in the year 2023, it's paying off now. It's really paying off on the cost side. It's paying off in the way the clients are reacting. And I have to say that also one of the reasons why we are so confident to achieve the \u20ac32 billion and 10% RoTE is now that all the hard work is flowing through -- is going through the P&L of the Private Bank. So I would say there is a continuous improvement. Also the decision, by the way, because you talk about loans and mortgages, clear decision of one item which we subsummarized under Deutsche Bank 3.0 and this is SVA. It was a clear decision by the Finance department and Claudio's department to reduce mortgage lending under one brand, the DSL brand. That is SVA positive. This is exactly what we want to achieve, and it's just one little evidence that we are working hard actually to further improve on the profitability of the bank and optimize our capital allocation.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mate Nemes, UBS.\nMate Nemes: I have three of them. The first one is still continuing with the SVA. Christian, you mentioned that what you did in the Personal Bank was one clear example of that. Can you share perhaps other clear opportunities for the SVA Bank to increase resource allocation in certain areas and also conversely where you expect to see perhaps clear restrictions? Also how this aligns the demand side, i.e., where are there growth opportunities, where you can allocate more capital from an SVA perspective. That's the first one. The second one is a question on NII, perhaps for James. Are you still expecting about the \u20ac300 million pickup in the banking book NII in 2025? Or has this also improved slightly, as you alluded to '26 and '27 have improved due the hedge [indiscernible]. And the last question would be on RWAs. You clearly have achieved now cumulative \u20ac28 billion in RWA reduction. RWA optimization is ongoing. Could you point to the opportunity you see in the remainder of the year? What in addition can you achieve in the next 3 quarters?\nChristian Sewing: Yes. Let me start, Mate, on your SVA question. So first of all, I'm delighted that this topic of SVA focus and day-to-day SVA management is now fully incorporated in the bank. And you can see that in our monthly performance review meetings that we are really driving the businesses and as such, the whole bank based on SVA. Now I'll just give you one example in the Private Bank. And to be honest, this is one example where we executed. And rest assured that, obviously, we are going through portfolio by portfolio, and in particular, on those portfolios where, so to say, we are SVA negative, we are looking what can we do? Now one item is where we're starting, and you have seen that also in the Private Bank is repricing and repricing will play a role in the Private Bank. Repricing will partially play a role in the Corporate Bank. If you think about our trade finance book and our lending book, there is a chance actually to reprice. And based on all the data we have, the methodologies we have in hand, we will do this. Secondly, if you think about SVA, it's not only about actually whether we allocated capital in the wrong way, it's actually about the underlying cost and process cost of running the business. And hence, we are very much in the detailed work to think about more efficient front-to-end processes, in particular in credit-related processes. Again, for instance, the German lending book, the trade finance book, David Lynne and the credit department are looking into a more efficient credit process end-to-end. That will lower the running cost of that business. And actually, I think it will or we think it will make the trick to bring it into a clear SVA-positive business. Thirdly, we are looking SVA also from a regional point of view, whether there are regional portfolios where we potentially do not have the significant market share where we can restructure or from a brand name point of view, like we did it for DSL mortgaging in Germany. So SVA actually is a combination of repricing client-by-client review, which Fabrizio is doing in the Investment Bank and in the Corporate Bank, looking at the 5- to 10-year history of clients, whether we have, so to say, continuous SVA-negative clients where we want to go and will go now into the debate with the discussion with the client, what else we can do in order to make that relationship a more profitable one, but it also goes over processes. And at the end of the day, we wouldn't mind to take decisions to also exit certain sub-portfolio, if we are not convinced that we can turn it into positive. And therefore, I think it will be one of the most significant levers we have to really raise our return on equity beyond the 10% return to a higher number. And the progress which we have seen over the last 3 months since we introduced it to you, end of January, is quite significant.\nJames Von Moltke: It actually feeds nicely into your third question, which is RWA. And so one of the levers beyond what Christian just talked about is looking at more capital relief transactions through securitization to help various businesses. And obviously, the market is broader and deeper than a few years ago. And so we're sort of going, if you like, more deeply into the portfolio to look for securitization opportunities. Now that takes some time. So I don't want to sort of over -- go out over our skis in terms of how much more is achievable this year. But I'd certainly see us achieving the \u20ac30 billion target, maybe slightly more than that in '25. But at that point, sort of we move into the future, and we will continue looking at capital optimization in the years to come. The opening up of securitization markets with the Savings & Investment Union initiatives will obviously help in that regard. And the measurement of businesses by SVA makes them less inclined to hold on to revenues if they're being measured at, if you like, the very bottom line. In banking book NII, our guidance is basically consistent with where we were at the beginning of the year. There are obviously moving parts in that ocean. Rates have moved, but as you see, our hedging has protected us and we don't see an impact from the rate environment. We do see a benefit, as we mentioned, in the years beyond 2025 as the long-term rate curve has steepened and obviously, our hedging, the rollover hedging benefits us. And there's been a little bit of movement in FX and in volumes. But basically, we're still where we were before, about $13.6 billion. A lot of that, the year-on-year benefit is in Private Bank and in Financing. You will have seen there have been some movements in Corporate Bank. Some of that's just reallocation or reclassification of revenues sort of group neutral or even within the CB neutral as it reclassified some revenues into remaining income. But again, with all of that said, our guidance is in line with where we started the year on banking book NII, which is encouraging.\nOperator: The next question comes from Giulia Miotto from Morgan Stanley.\nGiulia Miotto: Two questions from me as well, please. The first one is on the mark that you've seen in O&A, related to the leveraged finance book. Could I ask you please to shed more light on this book? So how big is it? I don't know, performance through time, sector concentration, warehousing risk. Anything that you can give us would be useful. And then secondly, just on the SRT market. Have you witnessed any change in demand for SRT from investors, given the heightened macro uncertainty? Or do you expect any change in demand?\nJames Von Moltke: So Giulia, I actually don't have the size of the book in front of me. We talked about that a lot last year, but it is -- the on-balance sheet book is relatively modest. As you know, there's also a revolver piece of it. There's the underwriting pipeline that then gets distributed. But we're actually at a relatively lower point in the cycle given the slowdown of activity so far this year. The individual position that we were talking about is actually our last remaining sort of position from the pre-war period, so prior to March or February of 2022. It's one that actually we've had a reasonably sort of positive view on. We participated in a recapitalization last year. And the mark reflects really sales activity away from us and partially, we participated in the sales activity in order to free up capital, but there's certainly a possibility that the on-balance sheet position recovers over time. But in terms of orders of magnitude, it's larger in terms of an impact in the quarter than we would typically see. And the funded book is -- there's nothing like that and that remains in the funded book.\nChristian Sewing: I think you had one more question, Guilia, on any change in SRT demand. To be honest, no. We even concluded a transaction, I think, James, in mid of April, and we are actually very happy with the demand. It was the transaction which was focusing also on German mid-caps and the mid-cap portfolio. There was also no noticeable repricing required. So actually, there is a lot of demand. We haven't seen any change in behavior which also makes us believe that to the prior question on the \u20ac30 billion goal or \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion goal of RWA reduction that, obviously, with that what we have achieved so far with that, which is in the pipeline that we will achieve that, if not overachieve it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeremy Sigee from BNB Paribas.\nJeremy Sigee: I'll just keep it to one question actually, and it's a slightly broader one. You mentioned Savings % Investment Union as a lot of other banks have as well. Just how material is that on a 3-year planning horizon? I mean is that something that could make a percentage point or 2 of RoTE difference in your next 3-year plan? Or is it still a bit marginal, a bit blue sky? How material is it for you?\nChristian Sewing: Let me start and James should add. I think, yes, it is material, and it's clearly not yet in our detailed plan for the next years. And why do I think it's material for two reasons. Number one, we will see with the Savings & Investment Union, a lot of more investments actually into Europe also in certain asset classes like defense, like infrastructure. And in this regard, there are not a lot of banks actually who can handle that and who can bring investors together who have the access and the network to the investors around the world. And that's what we are already seeing right now. You cannot imagine actually the kind of the interest which was created not only by the Savings & Investment Union, but also by the German decision to invest more into Defense and Infrastructure and how many investors are now so to say, contacting us in order to be, so to say, part of this initiative. And hence, I would say that in this regard, the capital markets initiatives, the leverage which we can provide from a banking point of view in order to support these programs is actually quite significant. And again, we saw it in particular after the announcement of Friedrich Merz early March. The second part, where I do believe we have a huge opportunity is actually based on the Savings & Investment Union, but also based on the coalition agreement in Germany because if you read it in detail, there is a clear intention to look at the pension schemes in Germany and the way the people will actually provide for their retirement plan. And in this regard, I am convinced that we will see changes in this regard also in Germany. And I do believe that this is a huge opportunity, in particular for a bank like Deutsche Bank, not only because we have the 19 million end-clients in Germany, the retail clients, but also as we have, so to say, the product factories, be it in DWS or in the Investment Bank, which can provide for that. And the level of discussions we have with Berlin, but also with Brussels on how we can facilitate that, how we can make sure that we have a change in the pension scheme is on a very, very good level. And hence, I do believe on both sides, i.e., the Investment Bank, Corporate Bank supporting actually the corporates in the investments, but also on the Private Banking side, there is a lot of upside. And hence, I'm very positive, in particular for the outer years.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Coombs from Citi.\nAndrew Coombs: I have a couple of follow-ups, please, on the numbers. Firstly, on Flora's question on FX. I think you made the point about it broadly netting out when you get to PBT level. I think when you gave that FX guidance at the full year, you talked about being an \u20ac800 million tailwind for revenues versus a \u20ac400 million headwind for costs. And I have thought both of those would have largely reversed out, but perhaps you could give us \u20ac32 million and 20.8% guidance for the full year, if you marked it on today's FX rates, that would be useful. And then secondly, just coming back to the overlay for tariffs. I was looking at IFRS 9 disclosures on Page 41 and 42. And you obviously presented a bit differently to others. You talk about 1 percentage point of GDP being a \u20ac77 million adjustment on ECLs. The other banks have kind of provided you a downside scenario adjusted the weighting and given all the assumptions to the downside scenario. But anything you could do just to help us calibrate how you determine that \u20ac70 million figure? And particularly the \u20ac50 million on the macroeconomic scenarios would be useful just so we can compare and contrast what you've done versus others.\nJames Von Moltke: Andrew, so both -- well, the first one is a relatively easy question to answer. But I don't really want to get into sort of mark-to-market of the plan each quarter. Obviously, you'll see it in our results with the variances. But what I'd tell you is maybe to help is our plan, as I think we said at the end of January was done kind of with a rate of about 1.10 on the I to the U.S. dollars. You remember that December, it had gone all the way to kind of 103.5. And if we do it on March, it will be back to 1.08 and currently 1.14. So it's been moving around a lot. I think it's just -- it's fair to say that it's a downward -- so today, it would be a downward pressure on the ex FX numbers we showed you in January, both for revenues and expenses, netting out in pretax profit. On the tariffs item and the IFRS 9 sort of view, you're right. And one of the -- I don't want to say a challenge, but the positive and the negative of the way we show the disclosure is that you're seeing the sensitivity of each of the variables. And what we sort of implemented was an overlay that played with a number of variances -- variables. So U.S. GDP, U.S. unemployment rate, the level of the S&P, the level of the credit metrics. So I couldn't give you one metric to really sort of quantify what it is. We sometimes look at it in terms of standard deviations of all of the metrics. And hence, it's hard to give you an apples-to-apples comparison with what other people do.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Hallett, KBW.\nTom Hallett: I guess, firstly, on NII, kind of just following up. You need to grow key banking book NII \u20ac400 million over the next 9 months to keep in line with your 2025 guidance. How should we see the NII walk in both the Private and Corporate Bank over the next couple of quarters? And how much is related to non-hedge related benefits? And then secondly, could you provide us with any capital moving parts over the next couple of quarters and what we'll need to consider for modeling purposes? And then finally, on the DWS, the CEO noted a few weeks back, it's time to acquire a competitor. So I'm just wondering why it's taking 7 years since the IPO to consider this? And would a large acquisition alter Deutsche Bank's capital return plans in any way?\nJames Von Moltke: Thanks, Tom. So look, I think you'll see improvement from here, as I mentioned, there was some internal sort of reclassifications that we made in the Corporate Bank, but I think a steady but modest improvement from Q1 in Corporate Bank. In Private Bank, it's more pronounced and more related to the hedge rollover than any other factor. And in Financing, it's call it \u20ac100 million of the full year benefit more volume driven. Now I will say with all 3 businesses, volumes will play a part. Christian noted that in the Corporate Bank, loan growth was a little bit more sluggish in the quarter than we might have expected. But then spiked up at the end of the quarter. So if we do see loan growth sort of on average in the quarters that lie ahead, that exceed our current estimation or deposit growth, then we could have some volume-related lift on all of those numbers. But as I say, so most of the hedge rollover benefit you'll see in the Private Bank. I think your second question was movements in capital. With the first quarter behind us, it becomes a little bit more simple because we don't have really remaining model-related changes or sort of acceleration of the impact of equity comp is really concentrated in the first quarter. So it is -- at this point, it's really earnings net of accruals for future distributions or profit recognition for future distributions, net of balance sheet growth or business growth. Last question about DWS and M&A. I think Stefan's comment was more that we are better positioned today to think about and potentially pursue transactions for DWS than in the recent past in part because DWS was also working through some internal issues. But I don't want the implication to be that we haven't considered it at all over the now 7 years since the IPO. And I want to just emphasize, I mean, we recognize the strategic environment in which DWS is operating, and we haven't been sitting on our hands, but also appropriately, we haven't pursue transactions that aren't beneficial to DWS' shareholders or the group. So there's been some discipline attached to it. But Stefan's right to say that the company is better positioned. And of course, the market environment around DWS has changed. You've seen a number of transactions in the industry in recent days. I do want to emphasize DWS is well positioned with its existing business, and you can see it executing and performing well on its strategic intent with both inflows and the distribution of its assets under management as well as the performance. All are good indicators about DWS' trajectory from here.\nTom Hallett: Okay. I mean just a quick follow-up. But this won't alter Deutsche Bank capital return plans in any way? Or will it potentially?\nJames Von Moltke: No. I mean, look, we've set targets for our distribution, and we're bound and determined to deliver on all of that. Obviously, there is a resource envelope within which we manage all of the businesses and allocate capital, as Christian referred to, based on SVA. We certainly look at Asset Management and the DWS businesses with a similar view. And yes, we've got a year left to deliver on the targets that we set out, and we're determined to follow through on our plans and deliver on the distributions that we promised to our shareholders.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ioana Patriniche for any closing remarks.\nIoana Patriniche: Thank you for joining us and for your questions. For any follow-ups, please come through to the Investor Relations team, and we look forward to speaking to you at our second quarter call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now over. Thank you for choosing Chorus Call, and thank you for participating in the conference. You may now disconnect your lines. Goodbye.",

        "text": "Thank you, Ioana, and a warm welcome from me. Before we turn to our performance, I want to offer my perspective on recent events. The geopolitical landscape is rapidly evolving and uncertainty and volatility are likely to stay elevated for the time being. This will likely impact the world economy. We still believe globalization will persist, but we expect to see a substantial reordering of trade corridors and supply chains, and this may accelerate some of the long-term trends we have spoken about for some time. And we are particularly encouraged to see what is happening in our domestic market with regards to fiscal changes and structural reforms leading to a much needed economic boost for Germany and Europe. All of this underscores why we believe our Global Hausbank business model and 4 strong businesses position us very well to support clients through these unsettled times. And already, since the start of the second quarter, we are seeing clients increasingly seek our expertise and advice. Now let me turn to our results. We are very pleased with a very strong first quarter performance. We delivered revenues of \u20ac8.5 billion, up 10%, a strong start towards our full year revenue objective of around \u20ac32 billion. Our cost/income ratio was 61% with adjusted costs of \u20ac5.1 billion, in line with full year guidance. Our loan portfolio quality remains solid, Stage 3 provisions are down nearly 30% year-on-year, normalizing as expected while Stage 1 and 2 provisions were higher and including overlays in this more uncertain environment. Our pretax profit of \u20ac2.8 billion was up 39% year-on-year. And with net profit of \u20ac2 billion, our return of tangible equity was 11.9% in the first quarter. Our CET1 ratio of 13.8% sets us up well for the rest of the year, both to support our clients and reward shareholders. To summarize, the start of the year was very strong. We believe that we have the right business model both to face uncertainties in the environment as well as to steer the bank towards delivery of our 2025 targets. Beyond that, we have a clear management agenda for further developing our Global Hausbank offering for our clients and sustainably increasing returns for shareholders beyond 2025, which I will talk about shortly. Let's now turn to our resilient operating performance on Slide 3. We delivered pre-provision profit of \u20ac3.3 billion, up 34% year-on-year. Revenue momentum combined with cost discipline resulted in strong operating leverage of 11% with each operating division delivering positive jaws. Revenue quality is strong, 71% came from more predictable revenue streams in the Corporate Bank, Private Bank, Asset Management and FIC Financing. Net commission and fee income increased by 5% year-on-year in line with our goals and reflecting our strategic investments. Net interest income in key banking book segments and other funding also remained resilient year-on-year. Noninterest expenses declined 2% year-on-year to \u20ac5.2 billion as nonoperating costs normalized as expected. Our progress on operational efficiencies enabled us both to deliver adjusted costs in line with plan and continue to self-finance investments. Turning to Slide 4. Let's now look at the progress with our 2025 delivery. Turning first to revenue growth. Since 2021, we have achieved a compound annual growth rate of 6.1% within our target range of 5.5% to 6.5%. Double-digit first quarter revenue growth contributed \u20ac700 million towards our target of \u20ac2 billion incremental revenues in 2025. Second, in respect of operational efficiencies, we have reached 85% of our \u20ac2.5 billion target with \u20ac2.1 billion in cost efficiencies either delivered or expected from completed measures. Third, we have made further progress with our capital efficiency measures with \u20ac4 billion of RWA reductions delivered this quarter through a combination of data and process improvements and the securitization transaction. This brings us cumulative RWA benefit to \u20ac28 billion at the high end of the bank's target range of \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion by the end of this year. We have announced capital distributions of \u20ac2.1 billion this year, including the 2024 dividend and our recently launched share buyback program. This will take cumulative capital returns to \u20ac5.4 billion since 2022, and we remain committed to surpassing our capital distribution target of \u20ac8 billion in respect of the years 2021 through 2025. Put simply, our 2025 targets are in sight. Let me now turn to our long-term management agenda on Slide 5. Our aim is to deliver a sustainable increase in returns through 3 levers: Increasing value generation for shareholders, reengineering our target operating model and reinforcing leadership. First, we will deploy a shareholder value-add methodology in our planning process and decision-making to optimize resource allocations across the group, and progress is underway. In the Private Bank, we have reduced RWA exposures in below hurdle mortgages. And in the Corporate and Investment Bank, we are undertaking client level reviews. We are also making progress in reengineering our target operating model. In the Private Bank, we continue to transform our personal banking operations by reducing branches and moving to digital channels, resulting in a planned reduction of almost 2,000 FTEs. We are transforming our Corporate Bank German platform and overhauling front-to-back processes in the Investment Bank leading to improved client experience and efficiency. Finally, we are strengthening leadership by streamlining governance structures. We have already reduced our committees, councils and internal policies by about half. This speeds up decision-making and increases accountability while maintaining a robust control environment. As promised, a few words on how we are well positioned to help navigate clients through the dynamic environment on Slide 6. In Germany and across Europe, we see fresh commitment to support growth, boost competitiveness and accelerate reform. We believe Germany's loosening of the debt break will unlock considerable investment opportunities and the proposed pension reforms are expected to boost activity in the capital markets. At the European level, we see commitments to invest in defense and infrastructure and much needed embrace of structural reforms, for example, the Savings & Investment Union and measures to boost securitization. Globally, trading patterns are shifting. Supply chains are being rewired and new partnerships and alliances are emerging. All of this plays to our strength. Clients need a partner with the expertise, financial strength, product breadth and global and local network to help them navigate this changing environment. And we aim to be that partner. As our leading franchise and diversified businesses are best placed to advise clients at European and global levels. Our Corporate Bank was voted world's best bank for corporates by clients. We combined global reach with a local presence to support multinational clients as their supply chains evolve. We are already a partner of choice with around 40% of our revenues with multinationals come from cross-regional corridors. With deep roots in Europe and in Germany's Mittelstand, we are ideally positioned to help clients benefit as fiscal stimulus feed through the real economy. Our Investment Bank is also ideally placed to help institutional and corporate clients navigate this environment. We have the leading global non-U.S. FIC franchise. We were the top-ranked European bank in global SSA issuance and in EMEA cash rates. While in Germany, we have the leading O&A franchise. And we are well positioned to support the broader German and European defense agenda, where we have the leading franchise in aerospace and defense in Germany, providing clients with holistic global coverage. We're also Germany's leading Wealth Manager and Retail Fund Manager through our Private Bank and Asset Management businesses. This positions us well to help clients capitalize on savings and investment reforms. We have already rebalanced our Wealth Management business mix, resulting in increased assets under management flows, and we continue to scale up in our core growth markets. DWS, with assets under management of over \u20ac1 trillion, record net inflows of \u20ac20 billion in the first quarter and a market share of 11% in European ETFs and is ideally placed not only to serve German and European investors, but also to act as a gateway to Europe for investors globally. To sum up, across all our businesses, we believe we are very well positioned to serve German, European and global clients in a fast-changing environment. With that, let me hand over to James."

        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "Thank you, Christian, and good morning. As you can see on Slide 8, we saw strong delivery this quarter against all the broader objectives and targets we set ourselves for 2025. More importantly, we've done so without compromising on our investments, be it to support operating performance or our controls. Our capital position is robust after absorbing deductions for dividends, share buybacks and AT1 coupons and the CRR3 impact. Equally, our liquidity metrics are sound. The liquidity coverage ratio was 134% in line with our target, and the net stable funding ratio was 119% at the upper end of our target range. And while we recognize that the last few weeks have been turbulent and resulted in a significant amount of volatility and uncertainty, reflecting on the path ahead, our balance sheet remains strong. As shown on Slide 28 in the appendix, asset quality is sound. The bank's liquidity profile is strong. And together with our robust capital position and strong earnings momentum, we believe that we are well equipped to continue to support our clients globally and to provide advice and solutions as they navigate this time of uncertainty. Our prudent approach to managing our trading book also paid off in April. Our trading P&L has stood up well throughout the market volatility and developed in line with the bank's risk appetite. With that, let me now turn to the first quarter highlights on Slide 9. We've demonstrated strong franchise momentum across the bank. Investments across businesses continue to pay off, which drove a significant increase in revenues, both sequentially at 18% and year-on-year at 10%. And the balanced portfolio mix also enables us to weather times of uncertainty. Our cost/income ratio of 61.2% benefited both from our continued cost discipline and a normalization of nonoperating costs. Noninterest expenses in the first quarter are in line with our guidance for 2025. Profit generation was strong, and our post-tax return on tangible equity of 11.9% underpins the bank's ambition to deliver sustainable returns of greater than 10% in 2025 and beyond. Our tax rate in the first quarter came in at 29%. In the first quarter, diluted earnings per share was \u20ac0.99 and tangible book value per share increased to \u20ac30.43 up 4% year-on-year. Before I go on, let me add a few remarks on Corporate and Other, where you can now find further information in the appendix on Slide 39. With respect to development this quarter, C&O generated a pretax loss of \u20ac34 million, mainly from shareholder expenses and other essentially retained items, partially offset by positive revenues in valuation and timing. So let me now turn to some of the drivers of these results and start with net interest income on Slide 10. NII across key banking book segments and other funding was \u20ac3.3 billion, broadly stable quarter-on-quarter. As in prior quarters, Private Bank continues to deliver strong NII, supported by our structural hedge portfolio, while FIC financing continues to grow lending. The Corporate Bank is slightly down compared to the prior quarter, principally due to accounting reclassification effects in loan NII, which are offset in remaining income. Deposit NII was broadly flat as hedge benefits offset a reduction in policy rates and portfolio growth remained strong. With respect to the full year, in line with prior guidance, we continue to expect a material NII tailwind for the key banking book businesses and other funding versus 2024, which is principally driven by hedge rollover and deposit growth. Compared to our disclosure a quarter ago, higher long-term rate expectations, specifically in euros, increased the expected benefit of our hedge portfolio in the outer years. In the appendix on Slide 26, we illustrate the dynamics of the interest rate hedge in more detail. Turning to Slide 11. Adjusted costs were \u20ac5.1 billion for the quarter in line with our expectations. Cost discipline across the franchise remained high and materially offset an increase in compensation costs. This was driven by a higher performance-related cash accruals and increased equity compensation costs as a result of a rising Deutsche Bank and DWS share prices during the first quarter. With that, let me turn to provision for credit losses on Slide 12. Stage 3 provision for credit losses materially reduced in the first quarter to \u20ac341 million, in line with expectations. Stage 1 and 2 provisions were elevated at \u20ac130 million and included around \u20ac70 million of provisions related to the impact of weaker macroeconomic forecasts on forward-looking information as well as overlays including for direct tariff-driven impacts on select higher-risk names. The remainder was driven by model and portfolio-related effects. We feel comfortable with our underlying portfolio performance and the development of provisions that we recognize the ongoing uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment and monitor these developments closely. With that, let me turn to capital on Slide 13. Our first quarter common equity Tier 1 ratio remained strong at 13.8%. The CRR3 go-live impact was 1 basis point, since the reduction in credit risk RWA was largely offset by reductions in capital supply and an increase in operational risk RWA. Aside from the CRR3 go-live impact, risk-weighted assets increased, principally reflecting a normalization of market risk RWA, as previously guided. This increase was partly offset by a reduction in credit risk RWA as higher business growth was more than offset by capital efficiency measures, including a securitization transaction during the quarter. CET1 capital increased as the strong first quarter net income, net of AT1 and dividend deductions was offset by equity compensation, the FX impact of -- on account of the AT1 call and other capital charges. At the end of the first quarter, our leverage ratio was 4.6%, up by 1 basis point, as higher trading inventory and high-quality liquid assets were offset by higher Tier 1 capital alongside beneficial FX and CRR3 effects. With regard to bail-in ratios, we continue to operate with a significant buffer over all requirements. In short, our capital position remains strong. And with that, let us turn to performance in our businesses, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 15. In the first quarter, the Corporate Bank delivered a post-tax return on tangible equity of 14.4% and a cost/income ratio of 62%, despite an uncertain geopolitical and macroeconomic environment and lower interest rates. Revenues were \u20ac1.9 billion, essentially flat sequentially and year-on-year supported by interest rate hedging, higher deposit balances and growth in net commission and fee income, mostly offsetting ongoing deposit margin normalization. We continue to make good progress by further accelerating noninterest revenue development with 6% growth in net commission and fee income and benefiting from a particularly strong contribution from our Institutional Client Services business. The deposit base remained strong. Adjusted for FX movements, deposits were up by \u20ac13 billion year-on-year and by \u20ac6 billion sequentially. Provision for credit losses was contained at \u20ac77 million, including \u20ac50 million of Stage 1 and 2 provisions, of which \u20ac29 million related to net management overlays. Noninterest expenses were lower year-on-year, driven by the nonrecurrence of a litigation item in the prior year and continued tight cost management. Looking ahead, we believe that our international presence, strength in all trade corridors and strong footprint in Germany position the Corporate Bank well to support our clients on changes in trade flows and supply chains. I will now turn to the Investment Bank on Slide 16. Revenues for the first quarter were 10% higher year-on-year with strength in FIC driving improvement to the division's return on tangible equity and cost/income ratios. FIC revenues increased by 17%, with both rates and foreign exchange significantly higher year-on-year, reflecting heightened market activity and increased client engagement. We continue to support our institutional and corporate clients through volatile markets and saw activity increase across both groups in the first quarter, including our priority clients. Meanwhile, we continue to advance the business strategy of developing existing and adjacent businesses. Financing revenues were also higher, reflecting strong fee income across the business, combined with an increased carry profile, following targeted balance sheet deployment in line with our strategy. The targeted deployment in the business is also reflected in the increased loan balances compared to the prior year. Moving to Origination & Advisory. Revenues were lower year-on-year due to a loss on the partial sale and markdown of a specific loan in leveraged debt capital markets as guided. Excluding this item, revenues increased 5% on a like-for-like basis compared to the prior year quarter in a fee pool that was broadly flat. Advisory revenues were significantly higher in a static industry fee pool with the business maintaining the momentum of a strong 2024. Noninterest expenses were essentially flat with higher adjusted costs, which were impacted by FX translation, offset by lower litigation and reduced severance and restructuring costs. Provision for credit losses were \u20ac163 million, with the year-on-year increase driven by Stage 1 and 2 provisions, which includes tariff-related overlays, model changes and portfolio effects, largely offset by a material reduction in Stage 3 impairments, including CRE. Let me now turn to Private Bank on Slide 17. The Private Bank achieved a 43% increase in pretax profit, reflecting 7% operating leverage driven by revenue growth and further cost benefits from progress made in our transformation initiatives. Good business momentum continued with net inflows of \u20ac6 billion and higher revenues, driven by 5% growth in net commission and fee income from investment product revenues in line with our strategy, while net interest income grew by 2%. Revenues in Wealth Management and Private Banking grew 8%, reflecting double-digit growth for investment products, mainly driven by discretionary portfolio mandates. Revenues in Personal Banking reflect our decision to reduce capital-intensive loan products such as mortgages, while revenues from deposit and investment products were up 4%, mainly from discretionary portfolio mandates. The Private Bank has continued its transformation with an additional 60 branch closures and reductions of approximately 400 FTE in the quarter, on track to achieve almost 2,000 FTE reductions as part of further restructuring efforts in Germany. Benefits from these measures, coupled with normalized investment spend, including from the Postbank IT migration, and lower regulatory costs drove adjusted costs down by 4% year-on-year. Provision for credit losses in the Private Bank was impacted by the deteriorating macroeconomic environment, while underlying portfolio performance improved. The prior year quarter was impacted by elevated provisions in Wealth Management and transitory effects from the operational backlog. We expect the Private Bank to continue benefiting from a combination of efficiency programs underway in Germany, Italy and Spain, where benefits are yet to be realized, revenue growth initiatives and optimization of capital usage by recalibrating the lending book and higher focus on capital-light solutions, which in turn will lead to sustainable profitability and annual mid-teens RoTE in the near term. Turning to Slide 18. My usual reminder, the Asset Management segment includes certain items that are not part of the DWS stand-alone financials. Asset Management delivered materially improved profitability with a 67% increase in profit before tax. This was driven by higher revenues across all streams, resulting in a materially lower cost/income ratio and an improved return on tangible equity of 22.1%. The \u20ac730 million in revenues were primarily driven by higher management fees from both active and passive products, benefiting from growth in average assets under management. The increase in performance fees was driven by the ongoing recognition of performance fees on one infrastructure fund, while other revenues benefited from a more favorable outcome of fair value of guarantees. Slightly higher costs were driven by business growth and increased equity compensation costs as a result of a rising DWS share price during the first quarter. Assets under management remained over \u20ac1 trillion with record net inflows of almost \u20ac20 billion, driven by passive products of \u20ac13 billion, offset by negative FX and market impacts. Cash, SQI and fixed income also contributed with combined further net inflows of \u20ac11 billion, overcompensating for net outflows of \u20ac3 billion in active equity, alternatives and multi-asset products. In the quarter, a new private credit partnership with the Investment Bank was launched to enhance the alternatives franchise aiming to provide prospective investors with access to this highly sought-after asset class. Finally, let me turn to the group outlook on Slide 19. In short, our outlook remains largely unchanged, and we are on course to deliver our full year targets for 2025. We are steadfast in our aim to deliver improved profitability and shareholder returns. Our strong revenue performance in the first quarter provides the step off to deliver this year's revenue goal of around \u20ac32 billion, with our complementary businesses all performing well. We remain committed to rigorous cost management while not making any compromises on controls and investments, as we continue to benefit from ongoing delivery of our cost efficiency initiatives. Our asset quality remains solid, and we continue to expect Stage 3 provisions to normalize this year. We are maintaining our full year guidance for provision for credit losses, but the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment may continue to impact model-based Stage 1 and 2 provisions. Yes, uncertainty has increased, and we need to remain vigilant. But considering our strong financial performance and levels of client activity, we remain comfortable with our trajectory to deliver an RoTE of above 10% and a cost/income ratio of below 65% in 2025, with strong operating leverage and balance sheet efficiency, supporting further improved profitability beyond 2025. Our strong capital position and first quarter results also give us a solid step off for our distribution objectives. The \u20ac750 million share buyback we announced in January is already underway and we have proposed a dividend of \u20ac0.68 per share, which brings us to \u20ac2.1 billion of capital distributions so far this year. We will assess the scope for additional distributions in 2025 and remain comfortable on outperforming our \u20ac8 billion distribution target. With that, let me hand back to Ioana, and we look forward to your questions."

        "speaker": "Chris Hallam",
        "text": "I have two, both on revenues. So first, for this year, clearly, Q1 was strong run rating well ahead of the \u20ac32 billion guide. But obviously, a lot has changed in terms of the operating environment in the past few weeks. In some of the businesses, I suppose that's supported higher activity levels, but in other parts of the group, client activity would have cooled meaningfully. So how does that picture look for you across the group? And where are there, I guess, substitution opportunities for you? For example, let's say, a CapEx-related loan is delayed, but now the client needs additional short-term working capital finance. And then second, more medium term. On Slide 6, you outlined these kind of big emerging trends, which looks set to determine the competitive landscape over the coming years. I guess, simply, what gives you the confidence that following the transformation of the business, Deutsche Bank has the right footprint and the right risk and control set up to succeed against this backdrop, i.e., to take market share and to capitalize on those growth opportunities?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Thank you, Chris. Let me take your questions first, and James should add, of course. Look, like we said in the prepared remarks with regard to the full year revenue picture and our goal and our confidence in the \u20ac32 billion, obviously, first quarter helps a lot. We outperformed not only the consensus, we, to be honest, also are ahead of our own plan in the first quarter, which gives us all the confidence that we can keep the momentum and that we will see the \u20ac32 billion also at year-end. So first quarter helps a lot. Secondly, Chris, I'm really happy with the diversification in our business. And if you really tear it apart, then you can see that many of our businesses will actually be unaffected by that what we have seen in early April or are even benefiting from that over time. We can see a very stable and continuous development in the Private Bank, very positive, stable delivery path, supported by an ongoing growth in assets under management. So I would say also with having the monthly performance review meetings with Claudio, that this is a continuous path, which we enjoy, both in Personal Banking, also with additional deposit campaigns, but in particular, in the Wealth Management business with our Investment business. Similar good momentum in Asset Management, very happy with the first quarter results. We always forgot to mention also that I really have to congratulate Stefan also for reemerging into the Amdocs [ph] with DWS. It really shows that there is momentum behind the business is very positive on the outlook. Also here, I would say, with that what we have seen in April, also with the way they have managed the performance for our clients, it's actually a very good and convincing picture. And therefore, we stay the course on Asset Management, and there is, in our view, no concern that we will miss our full year results. In the Corporate Bank, we had a little bit of a weaker start in Q1. Fortunately, we offset that with the over delivery in all the other businesses. And therefore, I'm saying we are even stronger in Q1 than our own internal plan. But the nice thing is actually that the Corporate Bank will accelerate from here. So the sequential performance, we believe that we will see slight increases in revenues quarter-over-quarter from where we are right now. We can already see also a little bit more of demand in the Credit business, in the Financing business, in the Corporate Bank. We saw it already at the end of the first quarter. Now obviously, this did not or was not fully reflected then in the P&L for the first quarter, but you could see an increase in demand at the end of the first quarter, which also gives us the confidence going forward. And linked to your second question, I will get back to that. Look, in particular, what is happening also in Germany is a huge opportunity for our Corporate Bank, and I will talk about that positioning in a bit. On the Investment Bank, to be honest, I'm super happy with our FIC business. I think, again, we have shown that not only we performed very well in Q1, but also that we took market share. If I compare that with the numbers which we have seen from our peers, Q1 was another example that Deutsche Bank took market share in the FIC business. If we go deeper into FIC, to be honest, yes, we have seen some weaker days in the first half of April. But to be honest, we are back to normal, so to say, in the second half. And the outperformance in Q1 will carry us through the year and will also carry us through the somewhat weaker days in the first half of April. So I'm honestly very happy with that business. And don't forget that in that business, in the FIC business, we have a very stable financing business, where I would even say that the opportunities, which the market now presents in the financing business, also in areas like distressed and credit trading, are actually really good. And from our capital position, the power we have to invest there, I'm actually optimistic. So in this regard, there are pockets also in FIC, where we can benefit from the situation. And again, in the second half of April, we are absolutely back to normal flow business. And that then actually remains with the question, O&A. I'm actually satisfied with Q1 in O&A. You know that we had the one markdown, which we already mentioned also to the market mid of March. Outside that, O&A actually behaved very, very strong. If I now look forward with a very robust pipeline, stronger pipeline than before, and there is no deal canceled. Yes, we see some delayed deals, but no deal is canceled. And I do believe actually that with where the markets are right now, where I do believe we move, that I can see that actually Q2, Q3 with that robust pipeline is actually enjoying quite healthy numbers in the O&A business. So all in all, looking at the outperformance in Q1, looking at the chances and opportunities we see in the Private Bank, and part of the FIC businesses, the continuous inflow on Asset Management and now the acceleration in the Corporate Bank makes me absolutely comfortable with our \u20ac32 billion revenue goal. With regard to your second question, look, I really do see for the time being 3 trends. And this is where James and I try to focus the bank on in terms of delivery and client delivery. Number one, and let me start with that, in my view, is the global volatility, uncertainty clearly also with our clients. But here, the concept of the Global Hausbank is working. And we said it in the previous quarters and again in Q1, but also in particular in April, we can see that the demand for advice, the demand of a global bank with a global network is higher than ever before. And I also see actually that a lot of clients, and we even have tangible examples in the O&A business, in the Corporate Bank business where clients want to actually see the European alternative to the U.S. banks, in particular, in a world which is more fragmented than before. So the setup as the Global Hausbank, with strong roots here in our home market, clearly helps us. Secondly, I have been on the record with supporting statements of that, what we will see from the new coalition. I do think that Germany can digest actually the additional debt, which you intend to take on in order to do investments. There are huge opportunities to leverage that with private debt, to leverage that with financings. And that's actually what we started to see at the end of March. And therefore, we're saying we see in the Corporate Bank that there is a trend with regard to financing, which goes into the right direction. And I do believe if the government is taking the right decisions over the next 3 months, and you have heard actually Friedrich Merz that he is intending to take some accelerated decisions before the summer break. That will be actually very good for the atmosphere, for the psychology in the country, for the consumption in the country, and obviously, we will benefit from that in the various business lines. Thirdly, we should not forget all the acceleration also when it comes to Capital Markets Union or better said, Savings & Investment Union in Europe. Again, the focus is on banks with the capital markets business. We have seen the reallocation of funds already to Europe over the last weeks. We have clearly seen that also in our flows. And to be honest with that, what is happening in Brussels, together with that, what is happening in Germany, I think we are rightly placed to benefit from that. All that with the outperformance in Q1 makes me really confident that we can achieve our goals and that we will achieve our goals on the revenue side but also on the profitability side."

        "text": "First question is regarding the comment around FIC slowdown. Can you just put that in context? In April, you mentioned that, I think on Bloomberg and Christian, you just mentioned that as well. Could you just put it in context of what time frame you're comparing? And secondly, in that context, just tell me what subsegments of FIC are weaker? Is it credit? Is it rates? Maybe even by geography, if possible, just so we get an idea and if this is just an immediate reaction of what happened in the market post tariffs? Or if it's an ongoing issue that we should think about in our modeling? And then the second question is regarding your outlook. GDP, U.S. assumption 1.7%, China 4.5%. Just wondering if these numbers, what would happen if there would be significantly lower because they look a bit on the higher end of what market consensus expectation or forward curves are assuming. If you could discuss that relative to your 10% RoTE plus target and issues around that if we should think about -- if it could have a negative impact, so to say?"

        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "Sure. Thanks, Kian. I'll start on the fixed guidance that we've given or commentary about the market. Look, I think one important thing is to say is that the second half of April, and it isn't precisely in halves, but I think the easiest way to think about it is second half of April, resumed a pattern that looked very much like what you see in the disclosure on daily trading results in the FIC business for much of the first quarter. So to your question about ongoing, it isn't a concern for us at the moment at all. In fact, I think we're well positioned to recapture the foregone revenues from the first half of April, as in the balance of the quarter. In fairness, we're actually up year-on-year still in April. So we look at this with sort of a relaxed view. Naturally in markets that are as turbulent as the ones we experienced in the first couple of weeks of April, you're going to see some correlations break down some impact on the books. But we were reasonably happy. So there was, of course, a slowdown in a few weekdays, but we were happy with how the desks performed in that environment, the way we were able to stand in to provide liquidity for clients, pricing, what have you. In terms of the products, it was a little sort of varied around the world. But to your point, credit struggled more, and there were elements of -- in the rates and FX complexes where again, correlations moving created some disturbance. What's interesting is how quickly and almost fully the markets have recovered over the course of April. Again, going to your question about is it an ongoing concern? As we sit here today, really, it's not. And actually, I've been positively impressed by the way in which investors have continued to be engaged in the environment that we have, which is reasonably fast moving. In terms of the outlook, lots of our assumptions are driven by macroeconomic variables, and I'll focus on revenues and expenses. And naturally, we look at downside scenarios. And that was the principal driver, of course, of the overlay that we took in provisions in Q1. We think that overlay was prudent and appropriate and actually reflects how the macroeconomic consensus has moved since the end of March. So we feel quite comfortable with how, if you like, first quarter reporting reflects our outlook as well as the consensus environment today. The other thing, just more broadly to the question you asked and really Christian's response to Chris's question, we see a lot of, what I'll call, sort of portfolio effects in our businesses. So businesses that are maybe negatively affected by certain elements of the macro environment will be offset by others that are benefited. And so it isn't at all linear. And we feel like the balance of risks and opportunities that we see in the market really underscores our outlook, as Christian just mentioned. And hence, we're feeling pretty good about the overall macro environment even as it's changed since the beginning of the year when we last spoke."

You mentioned that you were continuing to assess the scope for additional share buybacks. So I wanted to ask you whether you have started discussions with the regulator regarding second tranche of buybacks and if we could have any indication regarding the potential size of the second tranche? And is there any particular indicator that you and the regulators are looking at to be able to launch that second tranche? On CLP, so you just mentioned overlays on tariffs, so is it possible to know what was the size of this overlay? And what are the underlying assumptions that you are taking regarding the tariff impact and the whole tariff situation? And with the development situation that we see on the CLP front, how does it impact your full year guidance? Is it -- are we still on track for the \u20ac350 million to \u20ac400 million per quarter that you mentioned earlier?"

Look, on the distribution, I stay to that what I said and what we said end of January because that was a clear outlook statement that, a, obviously, we have the approval for the \u20ac750 million, which started -- where we started the program early April. And then we clearly said that we want to deliver 2 quarters where we show that we are on track for our 10% RoTE. Now we are very happy with that what we have seen in Q1. You have heard from our kind of outlook statements, which we just reiterated that we remain comfortable on the 10%. And then we will reassess during the second quarter, obviously, the possibility of a second buyback, and we'll then start the discussions. But I would find it not fair actually if, on the one hand, I'm doing a clear statement in January and saying, I measure myself and we measure ourselves against the first 2 quarters and then I change track. Obviously, the outlook in the overall economy changed, we have shown that we can deal with that. We have shown that we have laid a very solid foundation, we are at 13.8%. And therefore, I feel overall pretty good about all this. But now we are focusing on delivery of a strong Q2. And then I'm sure we will reassess and have the discussion with our regulators."

      {
        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "And Nicolas, on the CLP side, it's very nuanced, but the easiest way to think about it is that the overlay represents about \u20ac70 million broken into 2 parts. One is as I just -- part of the answer to Kian's question is, we put it -- we assumed a set of macroeconomic variables that were more pessimistic than what were present in the market in March, and that represented about \u20ac50 million of the \u20ac70 million. And essentially, the consensus is caught up with that level. So we feel good that, that was appropriately calibrated. So \u20ac50 million on macroeconomic variables reflected in a forward-looking indicator overlay. And about \u20ac20 million reflecting what I'd call collective staging. So we've been looking not just recently, but for the past couple of quarters, either at sectors or individual obligors particularly exposed to tariffs. And that can be based on their own export activity, their supply chain, what we think the competitive environment for their business might be and how it will be affected by tariffs and so on. And so we took some actions around collective staging, and that represents really the other \u20ac20 million. To be fair, there's probably some amount in what I would think of as the baseline. So the rest of it is about \u20ac400 million. There's some of that \u20ac400 million actually would also reflect tariff-related impacts that have been sort of bleeding in as individual credit decisions for obligors are reflected, but the easiest way to think about it is \u20ac400 million run rate, which is in line with our guidance, and we always expected the first quarter to be a little higher than the rest of the year and \u20ac70 million of overlay broken out, as I described. As to the guidance, look, the wide end would have been about \u20ac1.6 billion. We note that consensus is a little higher than that already. And we think based on how Stage 3 is -- has developed, and we now see the evidence of that normalization that we called for. We think that's entirely reasonable -- would kind of imply about \u20ac375 million per quarter from here, which, absent a deterioration of macroeconomic variables, would be entirely achievable and to be expected, hence, sticking with the guidance."

I'm just wondering, should we be worried about a risk-weighted asset impact from Value-at-Risk reaches or counterparty risk or liquidity drawdowns by customers or anything like that? Would you expect a material impact in the second quarter that could possibly affect your second buyback decision? That's the first question. Second question is on the U.S. commercial real estate outlook. Christain, I think you gave some fairly constructive comments at the conference in the middle of March, a lower -- sorry, a higher rate trajectory didn't affect your expectations there. I was just wondering if you could give us an update whether there's been a significant change since then, whether you've reassessed your \u20ac0.5 billion stress loss for the commercial real estate portfolio. And then final question is just on when we can expect some more concrete targets for future years rather than simply a continuous improvement? Do we need to wait until next year when the CFO succession process has played out before that can come? Or can you give us something more concrete or can we expect something more concrete before then?"

        "text": "Thanks, Matthew. So market risk RWA, interesting question. There is, of course, a risk, but we think we've managed that down. So the VaR outliers, we haven't triggered at this point over the threshold at which sVaR outliers would produce an increase in market risk RWA. And you've -- the sVaR did tick up at the beginning of the month, and we've managed that down through hedging and portfolio actions. So those risks are there in a -- if the market were to become disrupted later in the quarter, but we think the impact of what was present in the market in the first half of April has been managed. And at the moment, we don't see that presenting itself. On the CRE side, it's interesting. The market indicators are a little bit mixed. So office in the index is slightly down, I'll call it, flat. Leasing activity has actually ticked up, which is good. And of course, rates and sponsor behavior have, while they've moved around, largely unchanged. So our outlook for CRE continues to be where it was beginning of the year. We would see a steady improvement from the levels that we show you in Q1. In fact, there was only one new default in CRE in office in the U.S. this quarter. So what you have is essentially 100% of the provision associated with valuation adjustments on existing defaulted positions. And hence, I think we get closer to the point where you see a more dramatic decline in the provision levels. As you say, we're tracking a little bit closer sort of every quarter to the severe stress, but we don't see anything that would suggest another leg down in CRE, we're still in line with our earlier expectations."

Or does it mean year-to-date up in fixed income for the full 4 months? And the second question is about the increase in compensation expenses that you flagged that is coming partly from the rise in your share price. The DWS did mention that they are hedging this effect to some degree. Are you also doing this at Deutsche Bank level? And if so, was there any positive benefit from this in one of the revenue items and if so, where? And the final question I wanted to ask, please, is on the NSFR ratio, and in particular on the dollar-based NSFR ratio, which received a bit of attention recently with the EBA report. Could you give us a rough indication of where your dollar NSFR ratio sits, the EBA said that German banks on average were at 76%. Can you give us an indication where you are, please?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "James Von Moltke",
        "text": "Thanks, Stefan. So the answer is both on FIC revenue. So we are obviously up big year-on-year in the first quarter. We're up slightly in April, in the month of April, and therefore, we remain up significantly year-on-year, year-to-date in FIC. And that's encouraging to see how the franchise strength, the investments that we've talked about, client engagement, all of those things sort of playing out as we hoped and have been -- and Ram and his team have been working to for such a long time. So it's encouraging development. And to the earlier question, if the market tone stays as it has been now in the second half of April and in the first quarter, we'd certainly recapture the weakness in the early days of April. On the compensation expenses, at the end of the day, it falls through to the expense line on a consolidated basis. Essentially, the group offers DWS some benefit of hedging that risk. It transfers and creates a revenue item for DWS that's then eliminated on consolidation at the group level, but the compensation cost impact shows up at the group on a consolidated basis. And actually, it represents year-on-year, a decent size of the increase. If I break the compensation numbers up, it's basically 4 parts, all about equal between \u20ac30 million and \u20ac40 million. Foreign exchange translation, the stock impact, variable compensation and then the net impact of fixed pay coming through, which we think is a good outcome, especially as a lot of that was then offset in non-comp expenses. On the NSFR, we wanted to tip our hat to the question that was raised in the EBA report. So on Page 28, we show you a number of more than 90% of our U.S. dollar asset side being funded by native U.S. dollar liabilities. Now NSFR by its definition doesn't include cross-currency funding, which is just a quirk or a feature of it. Including cross-currency funding, we'd be above -- safely above 100% on -- and we think our dollar liquidity position is extremely strong because essentially, the liabilities fund, a balance sheet that is, I'll call it, 80% loan-to-deposit and a significant amount of cash and high-quality liquid assets in dollars. If anything, our dollar funding is more robust than other currencies. So we saw that, and I think, hopefully, have provided with that one data point, a good response. I will say, and we maybe come up to this tomorrow on the fixed income call, there's a lot of I'll say, technology, limits, controls, maturity ladders and what have you that we apply to managing currency risks and the funding implications of currency risk on the balance sheet. So we think we've got a very, very strong, robust set of capabilities there."

And you have, I think, 18% of your cost base in U.S. dollar, assuming the euro dollar remains where it currently is around 1.14, this should have I think, around 1% positive impact on your cost base year-on-year. So I'm just asking, is there -- would you say there is positive risk to your cost guidance for this year? Or not really because despite the good Q1, despite the FX tailwinds here, you think this could be offset somewhere else by the end of this year? The second question is on O&A revenues. I see you've dropped the guidance of the plus \u20ac600 million you expected for this year. I think it's clear what you've explained already on this call. Maybe just to ask, do you still think nevertheless, that you could expect an increase year-on-year or it could be flat or down? Just to help us frame the range of outcomes here, considering current market conditions, but also your pipeline?"

You've seen that year-on-year in the first quarter, kind of the average was a \u20ac52 million upward movement in reported expenses that would flip around next quarter to some degree, depending on the path of the exchange rate. Remember, though, that because we have U.S. dollar revenues, it neutralizes more or less in pretax profit and in the ratios. There's a little bit of, I'll call it, tracking error, but by and large, the U.S. dollar nets out when you get to cost/income ratio, pretax profit and RoTE."

Therefore, again, I think it's really important to look at the probability weighted pipeline, which is still very robust. Also at the comment I made before that we haven't seen any canceled deals that we actually have seen a very nice development on the mandates, which we received. And therefore, if I take now Q1, if I look at the pipeline and the work we are doing on Q2. To be honest, I'm very confident that we will see O&A revenue numbers, which are ahead of last year. And again, given the diversification we have in the business is also the compensating business areas, even if we have a weakness in O&A versus our initial plan. We believe that this will be offset by other businesses and we have the really good cushion, which we have already established in Q1."

So just to make sure we heard your comments orally, but question one, so we had about a \u20ac2 billion runoff in mortgages in the quarter, which was relatively significant. And given kind of our strategic view as well as the decision to close the DSL channel, I think you'd expect to see some of that also persist in the year. Now again, our outlook statements about Private Bank are, I would say, bullish that we still see continued growth in the coming quarters. And so that would incorporate additional runoff of what we think of as capital-intensive portfolios. On the cost side, there was nothing special necessarily in the non-comp in Private Bank in the first quarter. We did have restructuring and severance, as you saw, most of the restructuring and severance charge that we took at the group level in the first quarter was in PB. We would expect that to lessen as the year goes by, maybe some more in Q2, but less in the second half of the year. There can be some seasonality in things like marketing expense and what have you. But by and large, what we'd expect to see is the continued impact over the coming quarters and into the subsequent years of the benefits of the sort of cumulative restructuring steps that we've taken around particularly branches, personnel, but also the impact now of more fully the benefits of the technology investments we've made in the past."

And also with the pain we, in particular, took in the year 2023, it's paying off now. It's really paying off on the cost side. It's paying off in the way the clients are reacting. And I have to say that also one of the reasons why we are so confident to achieve the \u20ac32 billion and 10% RoTE is now that all the hard work is flowing through -- is going through the P&L of the Private Bank. So I would say there is a continuous improvement. Also the decision, by the way, because you talk about loans and mortgages, clear decision of one item which we subsummarized under Deutsche Bank 3.0 and this is SVA. It was a clear decision by the Finance department and Claudio's department to reduce mortgage lending under one brand, the DSL brand. That is SVA positive. This is exactly what we want to achieve, and it's just one little evidence that we are working hard actually to further improve on the profitability of the bank and optimize our capital allocation."

Can you share perhaps other clear opportunities for the SVA Bank to increase resource allocation in certain areas and also conversely where you expect to see perhaps clear restrictions? Also how this aligns the demand side, i.e., where are there growth opportunities, where you can allocate more capital from an SVA perspective. That's the first one. The second one is a question on NII, perhaps for James. Are you still expecting about the \u20ac300 million pickup in the banking book NII in 2025? Or has this also improved slightly, as you alluded to '26 and '27 have improved due the hedge [indiscernible]. And the last question would be on RWAs. You clearly have achieved now cumulative \u20ac28 billion in RWA reduction. RWA optimization is ongoing. Could you point to the opportunity you see in the remainder of the year?

      },
      {
        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Yes. Let me start, Mate, on your SVA question. So first of all, I'm delighted that this topic of SVA focus and day-to-day SVA management is now fully incorporated in the bank. And you can see that in our monthly performance review meetings that we are really driving the businesses and as such, the whole bank based on SVA. Now I'll just give you one example in the Private Bank. And to be honest, this is one example where we executed. And rest assured that, obviously, we are going through portfolio by portfolio, and in particular, on those portfolios where, so to say, we are SVA negative, we are looking what can we do? Now one item is where we're starting, and you have seen that also in the Private Bank is repricing and repricing will play a role in the Private Bank. Repricing will partially play a role in the Corporate Bank. If you think about our trade finance book and our lending book, there is a chance actually to reprice. And based on all the data we have, the methodologies we have in hand, we will do this. Secondly, if you think about SVA, it's not only about actually whether we allocated capital in the wrong way, it's actually about the underlying cost and process cost of running the business. And hence, we are very much in the detailed work to think about more efficient front-to-end processes, in particular in credit-related processes. Again, for instance, the German lending book, the trade finance book, David Lynne and the credit department are looking into a more efficient credit process end-to-end. That will lower the running cost of that business. And actually, I think it will or we think it will make the trick to bring it into a clear SVA-positive business. Thirdly, we are looking SVA also from a regional point of view, whether there are regional portfolios where we potentially do not have the significant market share where we can restructure or from a brand name point of view, like we did it for DSL mortgaging in Germany. So SVA actually is a combination of repricing client-by-client review, which Fabrizio is doing in the Investment Bank and in the Corporate Bank, looking at the 5- to 10-year history of clients, whether we have, so to say, continuous SVA-negative clients where we want to go and will go now into the debate with the discussion with the client, what else we can do in order to make that relationship a more profitable one, but it also goes over processes. And at the end of the day, we wouldn't mind to take decisions to also exit certain sub-portfolio, if we are not convinced that we can turn it into positive. And therefore, I think it will be one of the most significant levers we have to really raise our return on equity beyond the 10% return to a higher number. And the progress which we have seen over the last 3 months since we introduced it to you, end of January, is quite significant."

        "text": "It actually feeds nicely into your third question, which is RWA. And so one of the levers beyond what Christian just talked about is looking at more capital relief transactions through securitization to help various businesses. And obviously, the market is broader and deeper than a few years ago. And so we're sort of going, if you like, more deeply into the portfolio to look for securitization opportunities. Now that takes some time. So I don't want to sort of over -- go out over our skis in terms of how much more is achievable this year. But I'd certainly see us achieving the \u20ac30 billion target, maybe slightly more than that in '25. But at that point, sort of we move into the future, and we will continue looking at capital optimization in the years to come. The opening up of securitization markets with the Savings & Investment Union initiatives will obviously help in that regard. And the measurement of businesses by SVA makes them less inclined to hold on to revenues if they're being measured at, if you like, the very bottom line. In banking book NII, our guidance is basically consistent with where we were at the beginning of the year. There are obviously moving parts in that ocean. Rates have moved, but as you see, our hedging has protected us and we don't see an impact from the rate environment. We do see a benefit, as we mentioned, in the years beyond 2025 as the long-term rate curve has steepened and obviously, our hedging, the rollover hedging benefits us. And there's been a little bit of movement in FX and in volumes. But basically, we're still where we were before, about $13.6 billion. A lot of that, the year-on-year benefit is in Private Bank and in Financing. You will have seen there have been some movements in Corporate Bank. Some of that's just reallocation or reclassification of revenues sort of group neutral or even within the CB neutral as it reclassified some revenues into remaining income. But again, with all of that said, our guidance is in line with where we started the year on banking book NII, which is encouraging."

Could I ask you please to shed more light on this book? So how big is it? I don't know, performance through time, sector concentration, warehousing risk. Anything that you can give us would be useful. And then secondly, just on the SRT market. Have you witnessed any change in demand for SRT from investors, given the heightened macro uncertainty? Or do you expect any change in demand?"

        "text": "So Giulia, I actually don't have the size of the book in front of me. We talked about that a lot last year, but it is -- the on-balance sheet book is relatively modest. As you know, there's also a revolver piece of it. There's the underwriting pipeline that then gets distributed. But we're actually at a relatively lower point in the cycle given the slowdown of activity so far this year. The individual position that we were talking about is actually our last remaining sort of position from the pre-war period, so prior to March or February of 2022. It's one that actually we've had a reasonably sort of positive view on. We participated in a recapitalization last year. And the mark reflects really sales activity away from us and partially, we participated in the sales activity in order to free up capital, but there's certainly a possibility that the on-balance sheet position recovers over time. But in terms of orders of magnitude, it's larger in terms of an impact in the quarter than we would typically see. And the funded book is -- there's nothing like that and that remains in the funded book."

We even concluded a transaction, I think, James, in mid of April, and we are actually very happy with the demand. It was the transaction which was focusing also on German mid-caps and the mid-cap portfolio. There was also no noticeable repricing required. So actually, there is a lot of demand. We haven't seen any change in behavior which also makes us believe that to the prior question on the \u20ac30 billion goal or \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac30 billion goal of RWA reduction that, obviously, with that what we have achieved so far with that, which is in the pipeline that we will achieve that, if not overachieve it."

        "text": "I'll just keep it to one question actually, and it's a slightly broader one. You mentioned Savings % Investment Union as a lot of other banks have as well. Just how material is that on a 3-year planning horizon? I mean is that something that could make a percentage point or 2 of RoTE difference in your next 3-year plan? Or is it still a bit marginal, a bit blue sky? How material is it for you?"
      },

        "speaker": "Christian Sewing",
        "text": "Let me start and James should add. I think, yes, it is material, and it's clearly not yet in our detailed plan for the next years. And why do I think it's material for two reasons. Number one, we will see with the Savings & Investment Union, a lot of more investments actually into Europe also in certain asset classes like defense, like infrastructure. And in this regard, there are not a lot of banks actually who can handle that and who can bring investors together who have the access and the network to the investors around the world. And that's what we are already seeing right now. You cannot imagine actually the kind of the interest which was created not only by the Savings & Investment Union, but also by the German decision to invest more into Defense and Infrastructure and how many investors are now so to say, contacting us in order to be, so to say, part of this initiative. And hence, I would say that in this regard, the capital markets initiatives, the leverage which we can provide from a banking point of view in order to support these programs is actually quite significant. And again, we saw it in particular after the announcement of Friedrich Merz early March. The second part, where I do believe we have a huge opportunity is actually based on the Savings & Investment Union, but also based on the coalition agreement in Germany because if you read it in detail, there is a clear intention to look at the pension schemes in Germany and the way the people will actually provide for their retirement plan. And in this regard, I am convinced that we will see changes in this regard also in Germany. And I do believe that this is a huge opportunity, in particular for a bank like Deutsche Bank, not only because we have the 19 million end-clients in Germany, the retail clients, but also as we have, so to say, the product factories, be it in DWS or in the Investment Bank, which can provide for that. And the level of discussions we have with Berlin, but also with Brussels on how we can facilitate that, how we can make sure that we have a change in the pension scheme is on a very, very good level. And hence, I do believe on both sides, i.e., the Investment Bank, Corporate Bank supporting actually the corporates in the investments, but also on the Private Banking side, there is a lot of upside. And hence, I'm very positive, in particular for the outer years."

        "speaker": "Andrew Coombs",
        "text": "I have a couple of follow-ups, please, on the numbers. Firstly, on Flora's question on FX. I think you made the point about it broadly netting out when you get to PBT level. I think when you gave that FX guidance at the full year, you talked about being an \u20ac800 million tailwind for revenues versus a \u20ac400 million headwind for costs. And I have thought both of those would have largely reversed out, but perhaps you could give us \u20ac32 million and 20.8% guidance for the full year, if you marked it on today's FX rates, that would be useful. And then secondly, just coming back to the overlay for tariffs. I was looking at IFRS 9 disclosures on Page 41 and 42. And you obviously presented a bit differently to others. You talk about 1 percentage point of GDP being a \u20ac77 million adjustment on ECLs. The other banks have kind of provided you a downside scenario adjusted the weighting and given all the assumptions to the downside scenario. But anything you could do just to help us calibrate how you determine that \u20ac70 million figure? And particularly the \u20ac50 million on the macroeconomic scenarios would be useful just so we can compare and contrast what you've done versus others."

        "text": "Andrew, so both -- well, the first one is a relatively easy question to answer. But I don't really want to get into sort of mark-to-market of the plan each quarter. Obviously, you'll see it in our results with the variances. But what I'd tell you is maybe to help is our plan, as I think we said at the end of January was done kind of with a rate of about 1.10 on the I to the U.S. dollars. You remember that December, it had gone all the way to kind of 103.5. And if we do it on March, it will be back to 1.08 and currently 1.14. So it's been moving around a lot. I think it's just -- it's fair to say that it's a downward -- so today, it would be a downward pressure on the ex FX numbers we showed you in January, both for revenues and expenses, netting out in pretax profit. On the tariffs item and the IFRS 9 sort of view, you're right. And one of the -- I don't want to say a challenge, but the positive and the negative of the way we show the disclosure is that you're seeing the sensitivity of each of the variables. And what we sort of implemented was an overlay that played with a number of variances -- variables. So U.S. GDP, U.S. unemployment rate, the level of the S&P, the level of the credit metrics. So I couldn't give you one metric to really sort of quantify what it is. We sometimes look at it in terms of standard deviations of all of the metrics. And hence, it's hard to give you an apples-to-apples comparison with what other people do."

        "text": "I guess, firstly, on NII, kind of just following up. You need to grow key banking book NII \u20ac400 million over the next 9 months to keep in line with your 2025 guidance. How should we see the NII walk in both the Private and Corporate Bank over the next couple of quarters? And how much is related to non-hedge related benefits? And then secondly, could you provide us with any capital moving parts over the next couple of quarters and what we'll need to consider for modeling purposes? And then finally, on the DWS, the CEO noted a few weeks back, it's time to acquire a competitor. So I'm just wondering why it's taking 7 years since the IPO to consider this? And would a large acquisition alter Deutsche Bank's capital return plans in any way?"

        "text": "Thanks, Tom. So look, I think you'll see improvement from here, as I mentioned, there was some internal sort of reclassifications that we made in the Corporate Bank, but I think a steady but modest improvement from Q1 in Corporate Bank. In Private Bank, it's more pronounced and more related to the hedge rollover than any other factor. And in Financing, it's call it \u20ac100 million of the full year benefit more volume driven. Now I will say with all 3 businesses, volumes will play a part. Christian noted that in the Corporate Bank, loan growth was a little bit more sluggish in the quarter than we might have expected. But then spiked up at the end of the quarter. So if we do see loan growth sort of on average in the quarters that lie ahead, that exceed our current estimation or deposit growth, then we could have some volume-related lift on all of those numbers. But as I say, so most of the hedge rollover benefit you'll see in the Private Bank. I think your second question was movements in capital. With the first quarter behind us, it becomes a little bit more simple because we don't have really remaining model-related changes or sort of acceleration of the impact of equity comp is really concentrated in the first quarter. So it is -- at this point, it's really earnings net of accruals for future distributions or profit recognition for future distributions, net of balance sheet growth or business growth. Last question about DWS and M&A. I think Stefan's comment was more that we are better positioned today to think about and potentially pursue transactions for DWS than in the recent past in part because DWS was also working through some internal issues. But I don't want the implication to be that we haven't considered it at all over the now 7 years since the IPO. And I want to just emphasize, I mean, we recognize the strategic environment in which DWS is operating, and we haven't been sitting on our hands, but also appropriately, we haven't pursue transactions that aren't beneficial to DWS' shareholders or the group. So there's been some discipline attached to it. But Stefan's right to say that the company is better positioned. And of course, the market environment around DWS has changed. You've seen a number of transactions in the industry in recent days. I do want to emphasize DWS is well positioned with its existing business, and you can see it executing and performing well on its strategic intent with both inflows and the distribution of its assets under management as well as the performance. All are good indicators about DWS' trajectory from here."
