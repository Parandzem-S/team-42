    "transcript": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before I hand over to Magda Palczynska, Head of Investor Relations, a reminder that today\u2019s call is being recorded. Madam, you may begin.\nMagda Palczynska: Good morning and welcome to UniCredit\u2019s First Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. Andrea Orcel, our CEO, will lead the call. Then, Stefano Porro, our CFO, will take you through the financials in more detail. Following Andrea\u2019s closing remarks there will be a Q&A session. Please limit yourself to two questions. With that, I will hand over to Andrea.\nAndrea Orcel: Thank you, Magda, and thank you all for joining us today. The first quarter of this year has been a notable one for our industry. The economic shocks and unexpected fragility we have witnessed across the U.S. and in Switzerland raise question about both banks' strengths and how they're operating day to day. These were idiosyncratic and specific to a segment of our industry with limited read across to European banking. However, they do highlight the need beyond regulation for banks to be managed efficiently, effectively and responsibly, and continuing to strive for excellence, principles which are at the heart of UniCredit Unlocked.  While the recent approval of our \u20ac3.3 billion share buyback and 1.25 billion early redemption of AT1 evidence, UniCredit's specific strengths and resilience, the results I will present to you today further underscores UniCredit's transformation, a journey, which whilst accelerated is far from being over. Every day, we continue to unlock internal value, and today's results are just one of many additional milestones to come. We're winning and are well on our way to becoming the bank for Europe.  Let's start our presentation. We have delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of profitable growth and the best first quarter ever for the group. UniCredit Unlocked is releasing our banks potential and the management of our three levers is delivering financial success. We now move into phase two of our industrial transformation. We have outperformed our prudent macro assumption. Our alpha actions and strong lines of defense have further propelled our results and will position us to outperform in all environments in the future.  We are upgrading our 2023 guidance and setting a new floor for the future, underpinned by the actions we are proactively taking to prepare for an eventual, less supportive macro environment. We continue to build a sustainable competitive advantage, resilient and growing results and a robust balance sheet. All this amounts to an Unlocked UniCredit bank focused on continuously seeking to improve itself and create value.  This is the ninth consecutive quarter of profitable growth and the best first quarter ever delivering a 2.1 billion net profit, 20.4% RoTE at 13% and 3.4 billion organic capital generation. The supportive macro is further boosted by our industrial transformation, and our operating performance is protected by our lines of defense. We feel that these two levers are not often taken into consideration. We are investing and strengthening our bank for the future.  We're investing in the network through hires, upskilling through training and the rollout of the UniCredit University across the group and in our technology through exactly the same levers. We're extracting inefficiency from our complex organization, our complex processes, way of working, products and technology. This is about constantly transforming our bank into one fit for the future. Our results show that this is working with record performance across the board.  Net revenues are up 57% year-on-year. This is especially impactful given the targeting of profitable quality gross, so a gross that shows risk discipline and is EVA positive. Costs were reduced 1% and RWA 9%, in spite of growth, inflation and our investment in the future. The strengths of our operational and capital levers are shown, respectively, in a best-in-class 39.2% cost income ratio and 7.7% net revenue on RWA. These are also our best ever.  As a result, our return on tangible equity exceeded 20% at a 13% CET1, which is more comparable versus our peers as it extracts some of our excess capital. And we generated 111 basis points or 3.4 billion of capital organically reaching 16.1% in CTE1. The strategy we're implementing is uniting our bank as one franchise capable of delivering consistent quality, profitable growth over the long term.  As such, we are upgrading our net profit guidance too in excess of 6.5 billion for 2023. This is pre AT1 and cashes coupon of 400 million, but post 300 million of restructuring charges as we continue to strive for operating excellence. Accordingly, we're also upgrading our distribution guidance to equal or in excess of 5.75 billion.  Let's turn to the next slide. Our value proposition is simple. We are reengineering our bank into one with a sustainable competitive advantage. We are already well underway in the execution of UniCredit Unlocked and are now determined to go further. We have a clear vision to set a new benchmark for banking and be the bank for Europe. Our winning strategy is client-centric, focused on our strengths and continuously striving for excellence.  We have a four-pillar industrial plan, which reinforced our commercial machine and will now improve our operating machine. Our three financial levers will continue to deliver alpha-driven results and create value over the long term. So that is how we win the right way together. This value has already been within UniCredit, but we are able to release it now because we have established a common vision and are united by our distinctive culture. Our people are striving for excellence, and it is this which enable us to capitalize on our unique and irreplaceable model. Next slide. Our strategic plan UniCredit Unlocked continues to leverage our inherent strengths and unlocking net value. We have 15 million clients across Europe and our unique gateway to the continent. We have 75,000 people in 13 leading local banks, 40% of which are in A or better rated geographies. We have two product factories and an evolving ecosystem of best-in-class partners, which enables us to deliver top quality solutions and products. We aim to grow by combining our world class factories and our local reach to provide products and services that competitor cannot replicate.  Our digital machine is resilient, and we have a strong data set. We're investing in both, to become a truly digital data-driven bank, positively impacting our clients and employees journeys. All of this is anchored by our shared ambition, principles and values. We strive for excellence and lead by example in ESG, always aiming to fulfill our purpose of empowering communities to progress.  We will now take a closer look to our industrial transformation plan in the next slide. Phase one of our industrial transformation plan is well advanced. This is about reinforcing our commercial machine. It has brought us closer to our clients and set the base for new run rate. Our people are unified. Our organization is empowered within a clear risk and capital framework. And we are integrating our frontline and product factories.  Phase two is just underway. This is about significantly improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our operating machine, which we are reengineering to further support our business. Our technology and product factories deliver scale and scope. We're simplifying our processes to increase speed and reduce cost.  We continue to broaden our product offering, automate and digitalize to enhance client experience. Our commercial machine now shows the right drive, the right mindset and an ability to deliver for clients. And we're just started. We now intend to support it with a more efficient operating machine. The combination of these two is what will create further value.  Next slide. We are already a different bank. Our transformation is well advanced, but we're far from being done. This slide highlights some of the many milestones we have already achieved with many more to come.  Let's turn to Slide 8. We aim to deliver differentiated financial results in any macro environment, thanks to our relentless focus on alpha. We're executing on all our three levers of cost, net revenue and capital. We continue to reduce non-business cost to invest while creating positive operational jaws where both revenues and cost contribute. We have grown revenue while maintaining structurally lower cost of risk. We're on course to achieve sustainable best-in-class RWA efficiency, all coming together to drive superior profitability [indiscernible] enabling outsize distribution.  As regards to beta, we were prepared for was one of moderate NII growth and high inflation. The scenario we currently face is one of improved rates and better GDP growth. We are boosting the supportive macro through our industrial transformation. We are protecting our operating performance with our lines of defense. We're therefore capable of differentiated results in all environments.  Next slide. Our results speak for themselves. Our gross revenues are up 18%, while our cost of risk has declined 93% to 8 basis points, thanks to the rationalization of our Russian provision, no longer needing to accrue overlays, and our strong asset quality and coverage which resulted in significant write backs. Our operating leverage is a key feature of these results and is now among best in class, as is our capital.  We note our 35% improvement in gross operating profit year-over-year. This confirms both the increasing strengths of our business and of our lines of defense, which as intended are currently propelling our profitability and organic capital generation. All of our business areas are contributing to this excellent performance.  We continue to create exceptional value for our shareholders. Our return on tangible equity at 13% CET1 reached 20.4%, increasing not only because of positive macro but also and more importantly, thanks to our ongoing industrial transformation and our lines of defense at work. Share buybacks continue to further enhance our value creation, especially given our low valuation. Note our tangible book value per share growth of 22% year-on-year. The 2022 share buyback currently in execution, combined with improved guidance, will further underpin these numbers going forward.  Let's turn to the next slide. Our product factories are growing organically and through partnership, strengthening the level of cooperation towards a full service client-centric bank. They are the engine of our capital-light revenue generation at 2.5 billion. We have begun to unlock the value of these factories, but there is more to come as we continue to invest in them. Corporate solutions grew revenue 3% year-on-year, an excellent result given the strong Q1 of last year because of the market situation then. Client risk management, transactions and payments and more recently, advisory and capital markets continue to drive growth. This compensate for the rightsizing of specialized lending due to the TLTRO reimbursement and the removal of Euribor flooring.  We're investing organically in advisory to capture market recovery. We are rationalizing and further enhancing our payment solutions through partnerships. Individual solutions have been more negatively affected by the environment year-over-year, but they are now accelerating quarter-over-quarter. Protection continues to be a standout while life insurance, which in our case includes mostly unit linked and not [indiscernible], and funds and portfolio management are recovering. The expansion of our nonlife product offering beyond CPI is bearing fruit.  Italy; our Italian business had yet another outstanding quarter, demonstrating its ability to deliver sustained quality profitable gross. Net revenues were up 13% year-on-year, gross revenue 20%. This was driven by NII up 66%, thanks to strict management of the pass through, thanks to our strengths. While fees suffered year-on-year, they were up 8% quarter-on-quarter thanks to strong performance in protection and asset under management sales.  Costs were reduced 2%, thanks to our continued focus on simplification and streamlining whilst funding circa 200 new hires in the network. RWAs were reduced by 15%. As a result, we achieved our best ever leading operating and capital efficiency with a 36.1 cost income ratio and 9% net revenue over RWAs. Profit before tax in Italy was up 29% to 1.3 billion. RoAC exceeded 25% and the region contributed 50 basis points or 1.6 billion of capital organically to the group. Our continued innovation in data was recognized by the Italian Banking Association as well as our innovation in products, for example, in home and health insurance. Finally, we continue to support communities by investing in our branches and restarting purchase of tax credit for Superbonus. ESG underpins all that we do reflected in our award for Best ESG Bank in Italy and in Europe 2023.  Germany; Germany's structural transformation continues powering excellent results. Net revenues were up 13% year-on-year, gross revenues were up 11. This was driven by NII up 8% and fees up 1% with an acceleration of a latter quarter-over-quarter. Costs were reduced nearly 6% while the ongoing transformation more than -- with the ongoing transformation more than compensating for inflation and investment.  We expect significant further efficiency through '23 and '24. RWAs were down 6% as well. Germany also reached its best ever operating and capital efficiency with a 40.4% cost income ratio and a 7.4% net revenue on RWA ratio. Profit before tax landed up 65%, up 700 million. RoAC reached 19.5%, more than twice its cost of equity.  The region delivered 30 basis points or 900 million of capital organically. We're supporting SMEs in their ESG transition by matching platform from green tech startups and have extended our smart banking model to micro businesses. We extended lending to medical services in underserviced regions to play our role in the community.  Central Europe; Central Europe has also set a new improved run rate. Net revenues were up 23% year-on-year, gross revenue 27%. This was driven by NII up 43%. Fees were stable quarter-over-quarter. Costs were also down 1% driven by our continued transformation in Austria. Our focus on operating and capital efficiency was reflected in a 39.8% cost income ratio for the region and 6.6% net revenue on RWA ratio.  Profit before tax was up 72% at 400 million. RoAC was 15.6% and the region delivered 9 basis points or 300 million of capital organically. Each bank is progressing its industrial transformation, while continuing to support clients' green and social transition. A significant progress in retail digitalization, Austria has enabled all startup products in mobile, while Czech Republic and Slovakia is now acquiring one-third of new clients remotely. We excel in our markets. UniCredit Hungary was awarded as the best international private bank in Hungary, while UniCredit Czech Republic was recognized as top acquirer in the Czech market.  Eastern Europe; Eastern Europe continues to deliver record profitable gross. Net revenues were up 39% year-over-year, gross revenue 32%. This was powered by both NII up 41% and fees up 6%. Cost gross was contained to 6%, less than half inflation and in spite of continued significant investments in digitalization and automation in the region. Our focus on operating and capital efficiency was reflected in a 34.6% cost income ratio and 9.3% net revenue on RWA ratio.  Profit before tax landed at 400 million. RoAC was 33.1%. And the region delivered 11 basis points or 300 million of capital organically. Our strong profitable growth is supported by each bank in the region. Croatia, Bulgaria, Bosnia reaffirm their market leadership position, introducing new products to help enhance the value of customer saving and improving overall quality of customer care.  Romania and Serbia further accelerated their retail growth and drove best practice solution in micro business, all in addition to their existing strengths in the corporate sector. Social impact banking initiatives have been rolled out across the region, as well as the first ever government bond issuance and numerous award.  Russia. We continue to take a clear and conservative approach to Russia, maintaining our support for Western companies while looking for opportunities to continue to derisk, minimizing current and future potential losses to the group. In the last year, we have decisively resized our operation, substantially reduced our exposure and increased our coverage of risk, both locally and cross border.  We have proactively enhanced our lines of defense and the impact from our extreme loss assessment has been reduced from 128 basis points to 38 basis points year-on-year, while group CET1 pro forma for an extreme loss impact has increased from 13.3% to 15.7%. We will continue in this direction.  Let's turn to the next slide. Our robust balance sheet is underpinned by broad-based increased strengths. We continue to see the visible outcomes of a conservative approach to capital, to asset quality, to liquidity and to interest rate risk. Our CET1 ratio has been driven by our high quality capital stock, transformed organic capital generation and sustainable distribution, all part of our long-term approach.  Our cost of risk is driven by a number of factors, including our high quality asset portfolio, low and higher quality NPEs, sound proactive staging, and superior coverage. In addition, we have substantially enhanced our overlays to best-in-class, enabling us to either protect or propel our operating results going forward and strengthen our risk discipline across the business. Finally, our liquidity buffers are strong. This is due to our high quality and diversified deposit base, our strong liquidity ratios, prudent asset and liability management, and finally our significant net positive exposure to ECB.  Next slide. We benefit from the highest CET1 with lowest dependence on AT1 which we continuously strengthened by best-in-class organic capital generation. This combined with distribution that works best-in-class continue to be set significantly below our organic capital generation results in an ever strengthening CET1. We do not believe many can claim that.  Next slide. Our solid credit portfolio means that our cost of risk is structurally lower than in the past. And we are prepared to meet future headwinds. Our gross NPE stock has declined to 12.6 billion with a much improved mix, three quarters being UTPs. Our net NPE stock is 6.5 billion. The bank is also surpassing peers when it comes to staging and coverage.  We continue to have the highest stock of overlays at circa 1.8 billion that will either protect or propel our result as they are released and they will be. Finally, we continue our discipline approach on new business with our expected loss of 26 basis points, 7 basis points lower than that on our stock, excluding Russia.  Next slide. Our robust liquidity profile allows us to better manage pass-through, balancing the interest of our clients with current and future profitability. Our deposit base is sticky, diversified, stable and high quality. Our liquidity ratios are all strong. We maintain a prudent approach to ALM, managing liquidity and interest rate risk separately. Excess liquidity is placed with ECB and this is well in excess of our residual TLTRO borrowings.  I will now handover to Stefano Porro, who will provide you with more detail on our excellent results of the first quarter. Stefano?\nStefano Porro: Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 22. Before I take you through the first quarter '23 results, please note that my comments are based on a year-on-year comparison, that is first quarter '23 versus first quarter '22, unless otherwise noted. Let's look at the P&L in more detail, starting with revenue. As a reminder, the majority of systemic charges are always booked in the first quarter.  This year, they amounted to 640 million, a decrease of 11% year-on-year, mainly driven by a lower single resolution fund contribution, partly offset by the tax on extra bank profits in Hungary, as flagged before, which was 49 million this quarter. In first quarter '23, we generated 5.9 billion of revenue, up 18% thanks to net interest up 1 billion. Excluding TLTRO, tiering and excess liquidity fee which no longer benefit from, revenue is up 23%.  Please note that trading no longer includes client hedging fees, which relate to the markup on client hedging transaction where the markup can be immediately locked. These are now reported under fees as they are characteristic aligned with other fee lines. Trading was ELF [ph] at 0.5 billion in first quarter '23, the lion's share of which is fixed income, currency and commodity business. This is 15% lower compared to a very strong first quarter of '22 that benefited from realized gains of the investment portfolio.  Let's turn to the next slide. Let me share some highlights of UniCredit's strong balance sheet and a robust liquidity position. Our favorable liquidity position starts with the structure of our balance sheet and a loan to deposit ratio well below 100% at a sound 90% where we're resilient and diversified the deposit base. More than 80% of our deposits are from retail and SME clients and are granular.  For retail, the average balance is below \u20ac20,000 and about 70% is guaranteed. Retail deposits are mostly sight, almost entirely so in Italy, while the term deposit share in Germany is higher at about 25%. Our deposit market share across the group is generally stable, while the decrease in volumes in the quarter mirrors our market trends and our focus on pricing. Thanks to our superior liquidity profile and balance sheet strength, we are in a position to be able to do so.  The pricing focus and single ticket large corporate use of excess cash explains the volume decline quarter-on-quarter. At the same time, retail deposits are only slightly down as some clients diversified their savings and shifted to assets under custody products, for example, BTPs in Italy. The clients are keeping their asset with us and our TFAs are up 7 billion in the quarter as a result of strong net assets under custody sales and the market performance.  Total deposits are still well above pre-2020 levels. We expect the overall deposit volume to continue slightly declining in 2023 as there is further rotation to asset under custody or asset under management, and as we prioritize pricing management and quality NII. This is also reflected in our deposit beta, which I will discuss in more detail later. We have about 220 billion liquid assets of which some 190 billion are regulatory HQLA.  The bonds in our investment portfolios are swapped to floating so we have virtually no interest rate duration risk. The large liquidity buffer translated to strong regulatory ratio. At first quarter '23, our liquidity coverage ratio was 163%, net stable funding ratio about 130%. The managerial target for LCR is at 125% to 150% range, and will also be met net of our TLTRO repayment in June.  We're in a comfortable position for our remaining funding plan this year. We have limited need for TLAC/MREL funding and no need to issue additional Tier 1 in the foreseeable future, thanks to our very high 633 basis points CET1 fully loaded MDA buffer, pro forma for the recently announced call of our 1.25 billion additional Tier 1.  Let's turn to Slide 24, and focus again on the quarter. Net interest income was 3.3 billion, up 10% quarter-on-quarter net of TLTRO, which no longer contributes to NII and was 0.4 billion in fourth quarter '22. We continue to experience a positive net interest dynamic driven by higher loan rates and still low deposit beta, net interest margin at 2%, up 11 basis points in first quarter '23.  Customer loan rates are up 66 basis points in the quarter across our region, leveraging on higher interest rates and thanks to our commercial action, which also led to front book margins being slightly higher than back book in the quarter. Average client loan volumes relevant for net interest are down 3.4 billion in the quarter, driven by Italy, mainly loans for ME and retail mortgages.  Client's appetite for lending as in general declined in the first quarter across Italy and Germany, while loan volumes are supported by 2.5 billion in USG lending in the quarter as we continue supporting our clients during transaction. Average client loans are stable year-on-year with focus on profitable clients, despite active portfolio management including the reduction of low performing businesses. Demand for loans is expected to be curtailed on the back of higher rates and we will concentrate on more profitable capital efficient loans.  The increase of customer deposit rate is limited to 21 basis points in the quarter, while the average Euribor three months was up 86 basis points. The IR customer deposit rate at 67 basis points is mainly driven by Germany and Central Europe, where our corporate business and IR term deposit composition play a prominent role. The rate also depends on the country.  In Italy, for example, where we have the higher stock of deposit, the customer deposit rate is 12 basis points, higher versus last quarter at 25 basis points. Our deposit pricing is below the system across most of our regions. Average commercial deposit decreased by 8 billion in Q1 '23, mainly in Germany, driven by the single ticket item I mentioned earlier, and it was also related to clients using part liquidity for corporate transactions. At the same time, deposits in Central Europe were stable and slightly grew in Eastern Europe. Average client deposit volumes are up 9 billion year-on-year.  Regarding the deposit dynamics this year, we expect stability for the less rate sensitive part of our client base, in particular retail and small businesses, while we are focusing on the deposit beta. Corporates will continue to be lumpy. We expect clients to keep investing or shifting the [indiscernible] excess liquidity to other assets. Let's take a closer look at our updated net interest outlook and sensitivity on the next slide, 25. We've updated our managerial net interest income guidance, considering the latest deposit beta and rate assumptions. Based on a 3.5% ECB deposit facility rate by the end of Q2 '23 and the remaining stable thereafter, and the deposit beta around 40% at the end of the year, we expect and improve fully our 23 NII guidance of over 12.6 billion. This is mainly thanks to a better average deposit beta for the year at around 30%.  The observed deposit beta for the group for both sight and term deposit in Q1 '23 is about 22%. The deposit beta for retail and corporate clients is at around 11% and 37%, respectively. This slight increase by 2 percentage points in the quarter is mainly driven by Germany and Central Europe. While in Italy, we still have a low level of circa 10%. We continue to see a shift from sight to term deposit, in particular in Germany; however, sight for the group is still about 8% of our retail deposit and nearly 70% of our corporate deposit base.  We actively monitor the client behaviors and level of competition and we'll see how the upcoming TLTRO maturities impact the market. The net interest income sensitivity for a 1 percentage point of deposit beta is about 120 million at current rates and deposit volume assumptions. The net interest income impact from ECB deposit facility rate increase of 50 basis points is over 0.3 billion, which also depends on how client behavior and competitive dynamics develop. If the ECB starts reducing short-term rates, our deposit replicating portfolio which is factoring into our NII guidance will continue to support our net interest income.  Let's turn to Slide 26. Fees in Q1 '23 were 2 billion, down 2% year-on-year, mainly as lower asset under management impacted investment fees in Italy. Quarter-on-quarter, fees are up 11% thanks to an increase across all three categories with investment and financing fees in Italy and Germany particularly strong. We are well diversified and balanced, as you can see from the following year-on-year development of our different component parts of fees.  Investment fees were down 8%, as more than 8% reduced asset under management stock negatively impacted management fees and lower market levels combined with conservative client portfolio management led to lower asset under management upfront fees. This is partially mitigated by better assets under custody fees, thanks to certificate placement and some shift from deposit to asset under custody.  Investment fees quarter-on-quarter are up 13%, thanks to a recovery in assets under management upfront fees at 246 million in Q1 '23. Financing fees are down 4% due to higher securitization costs stemming from our active portfolio management strategy and lower credit protection insurance linked to retail mortgages in Italy. Financing fees are up 24% quarter-on-quarter, mainly driven by a recovering global capital market activity following a seasonally low Q4 and also loan fees in Germany. Transactional fees were up 7%, thanks to payment and card fees driven by client activity across the regions and property and casualty insurance growth in Italy. Current account fees in Italy started to reprise reflected in new operating rates environment and are expected to negatively impact transactional fees worth about 20 million per month from April to around 2023. Client hedging fees were broadly stable as we continue to support our clients in defending their business outcome in this volatile environment.  Let's turn to Slide 27. As Andrea already took you through, costs fell 1% year-on-year. Let's take a closer look at HR and non-HR cost developments. HR costs down 2% year-on-year benefiting from lower FTE, down 4% as we keep focusing on the rationalization of non-business-related activities, while maintaining investment in key areas. The outcome of the negotiation within unions [ph] in Austria at about 8% increase for our population is considered in our full year '23 cost guidance. The trade union agreement in Italy is currently being renegotiated on a national level, while the German is valid until mid '24.  Non-HR costs are up 2% due to higher energy costs and the overall inflation impact. Net of the energy costs increase, non-HR costs are flat year-on-year. We will continue managing the impact of inflation effectively and structural cost improvements will help us keep our costs well managed beyond this year.  Let's turn to Slide 28. Cost of risk was at low 8 basis points in the quarter supported by our still low default rate at 0.8% and the good performance on repayment and back to bonus. Please remember that in Q1 '22, LLPs were almost completely related to Russia. And in Q4 '20, LLPs two overlays, we kept our overlay LLPs on performing loans stable in the quarter at around 1.8 billion to be used for any shop or to be released in the following two years.  Please remember, existing overlays are equivalent to over one year cost of risk of our only creditor log guidance. In Italy, the cost of risk of 29 basis points reflects ongoing sound asset quality and is mainly driven by provisioning on NPs. Cost of risk for Germany is low at 10 basis points and were the reduction in LPs. In Central Europe and Eastern Europe, we had negative cost of risk as a result of NP repayments leading to LLP releases.  Our updated spillover analysis confirmed the soundness of our group risk profile, which you can find in the annex. Also, in the annex, there are incremental details on our exposure to commercial real estate. The group commercial real estate portfolio towards clients operating in the construction real estate sectors is at 37 billion, with sound LTV of about 50%. Regardless of the industry in which the counterparty operates in, commercial real estate exposure financing and our corporate loans collateralized by commercial real estate is 60 billion.  In some Central and Eastern Europe countries, there is greater tendency to get real estate collateral on short-term working capital lines and other products amounting to about 8 billion which is included in increasing the commercial real estate exposure. Our exposure to commercial real estate versus total loan is in line or below market in Italy, Germany and Austria. The portfolio has been stable over recent years with declining gross NP ratio at around 4%. We have a high portion of fixed rate component and limited refinancing risk, thanks to our maturity profile and large portion amortizing repayments versus bullet. The portfolio is high quality and diversified by region and type of property. The group's expected loss on new business at 26 basis points also confirms the credit quality of our portfolio origination and how this discipline is ingrained in our organization. We continue to be vigilant to our underwriting standards, which were already reviewed and refined and post the war breakout, reflecting the uncertain macro outlook.  Let's turn to Slide 29. Our underlying asset quality remains robust, gross NPEs at 12.6 billion reduced by over 5 billion year-on-year. NPE coverage is stable at 48%. NPE coverage does not include overlays on performing loans which come on top. Our strong asset quality, high level of provisioning for NPE and overlay LLPs, we are uniquely positioned to absorb macroeconomic impacts.  Let's turn to Slide 30. In Q1 '23, our risk weighted assets to date to 299 billion, down 10 billion quarter-on-quarter driven by continued active portfolio management measure worth 2 billion. We will focus on reducing low performing businesses and 5 billion of business dynamics, which includes about 3 billion lower market risks and the effect of lower loan levels. There were no meaningful regulatory impacts in the quarter and are not expected through end of 2024. Risk weighted assets are down 31 billion year-on-year and are expected to stay below 300 billion also by year end.  Let's turn to Slide 31. Andrea has highlighted our strong CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter at 16.05%, including the accrual of 0.7 billion cash dividend. In Q1 '23, we organically generated 111 basis point of capital, 67 basis points from the profit and 44 basis points for our proactive risk weighted asset management. We're at our plan. We have started to execute to the 2.34 billion first tranche buyback for 2022. As of 28th of April, UniCredit purchased shares equal to 2.6% of the share capital for a total consideration of some 940 million. We expect to commence the second share buyback tranche of circa 1 billion shortly after the completion of the first tranche. This is highly accretive for both DPS and EPS.  Let me please finish my part by highlighting some specific items for Q2 '23. As indicated by Andrea before, we expect about 300 million integration costs for 2023, a material part of which is envisioned to be booked in Q2 '23. At the end of April, the Hungarian government changed the methodology for the calculation of the 2020 free extra profit tax, which is expected to lead to about mid 20 million higher tax for this year, which will be accounted for Q2 '23.  And I will now hand back to Andrea. Please, Andrea, the floor is yours.\nAndrea Orcel: Thank you, Stefano. I will now finish with some closing remarks. Turning to our group guidance for the full year and beyond. Given improved macro, accelerated progress on our industrial transformation and the effectiveness of our lines of defense, we meaningfully improved our guidance. As regard 2023, we now expect net revenue to exceed 20.3 billion, up from over 18.5 5 billion.  There is no change to our guidance on broadly flat fees on a rebased basis. They will be down slightly year-over-year due to a rising cost of securitization to support RWA efficiency and a one-off impact of the removal of current account fees in Italy, which is effectively compensated by a higher NII as we have already discussed.  I would like to bring again to your attention our expectation for cost of risk, between 30 and 35 basis points structurally lower than the past and with potential significant tailwinds that could drive it even lower. We expect our cost base to be less than 9.6 billion, down from less than 9.7 billion despite high inflation and continued investments, evidence of the ongoing benefit of our transformation.  We expect systemic charges of around 1 billion and restructuring charges of around 300 million to continue improving our efficiency in the foreseeable future. We expect stated net profit to be over 6.5 billion. We're referring to stated net profit to align with broader industry practice and for comparison purpose versus peers. It does exclude around 400 million in AT1 and cashes coupon, while it does include 300 million of restructuring charges that we expect to take mostly in the second quarter that will benefit us in the future.  The guidance does not include the potential positive impact from DTA write up. Our organic capital generation should be circa 250 basis points this year, up 100 basis points on previous guidance, supporting a 2023 distribution of at least 575 billion, an increase from our prior ambition of around 5.25 billion. Finally, we expect our return on tangible equity of 13% CET1 of circa 15%, an increase from 12.3% in 2022.  For 2024, we currently aim for net profit and distribution to remain broadly in line with 2023 guidance. This is based on a Euribor of 3% and an average pass-through at 42.5% with an exit rate of around 45%. We also assume there is a meaningful decrease in systemic charges by several \u20ac100 million.  Let's turn to Slide 34. Our unique investment case derives from the fact that the benefit from the current macro environment is amplified by our continued transformation and lines of defense, while they also further protect us from any reversal. As such, our current gross revenue, cost and capital numbers further benefit from our alpha generation while our gross operating profit is protected by our structurally improved cost of risk and the future release of overlays.  Finally, our outsize while sustainable distribution are supported not only by the continued improvement in profitability through the levers we have just described, but also are protected by our substantial excess capital that shall be deployed to underpin it when necessary. As such, the downside risk to both our profitability and distribution is significantly lowered by the levers I have just explained.  Let's turn to the last slide. We are crystallizing the net value from the macro environment particularly as it regards to the positive effect of rates, net of inflation and cost of risk. However, we also continue to be relentlessly focused on generating alpha, using phase two of UniCredit Unlocked to further propel current results. We aim to offset as much as possible of the expected reversal of the positive macro effect in the second half of 2024 and beyond to the benefit of our business and all our stakeholders.  As a management team, we see our job to be constantly and sustainably producing alpha and looking forward to the medium and long term to protect the bank from possible headwinds while benefiting to the fullest from possible opportunities. As such, we have accelerated and are now going further than UniCredit Unlocked with a further positive impact on fees, cost, capital efficiency and cost of risk.  We aim to ensure that the positive beta that is benefiting us today is replaced in as much as possible by additional alpha once it is reversed in the future. What we have shared today as we did with each one of the last eight quarters is evidence of what can be achieved with a common ambition, the right strategy and a distinctive culture and mindset positively obsessed with creating alpha sustainably.  Thank you. And I will now open for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Ignacio Cerezo of UBS. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Cerezo: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I've got two, if I may. The first one is on NII. You seem to be building deceleration basically into the rest of the year from the Q1 level. And considering calendar effects, et cetera, you would probably be expecting a little bit of a more stable revenue increase basically through the year. So I understand actually you have a quarter of your NII in CE. These days where probably rate expectations are a little more subdued into the next 12, 18 months, but if you can elaborate a little bit actually what is driving the slowdown through the year? And then the second one is on the cost side. Recurring question for me in the last two to three quarters, Stefano has alluded to that actually in the presentation, but just trying to understand if there is some degree of kind of hockey stick basically on the cost number beyond 2023, given those ongoing negotiations in Italy and the fact that you probably need to renegotiate trade union agreements again in Germany, mid '24 it was mentioned? Thank you.\nStefano Porro: So, Ignacio, in relation to net interest income, so as explained before, let's differentiate. So first, which is the level of pass through that we have, as alluded before in '22, is differentiated by country. So let's say is around 10% in Italy. To give the flavor in Germany is a little bit more than 30%. And in Central Europe is around 35%. So that is differentiated. The dynamic of the NII will be dependent on, one, the increased level of rates to the dynamic of the pass through. We are expecting, let's say, a good dynamic in Q2 as well. We might arrive to a peak, let's say, midyear clearly depending from the dynamic of the elements selected before, especially the pass through. In relation, you mentioned Central/Eastern Europe. In relation to Central/Eastern Europe, it is important to take into consideration also the dynamic of the average spread on the new lending, because the average spread on the new lending is positive, especially in Central Europe. So the front book pricing is better than the back book, by the way, not only in Central Europe, also in Eastern Europe. So this is also positively contributing to the dynamic of the net interest income. I leave the floor to Andrea for the cost.\nAndrea Orcel: So on cost, no, you should not expect a hockey stick. So as we said already last quarter, while we face continued inflation and accelerate at high levels, and while we are not relenting on the investment that we believe we need to continue doing on the frontline and in technology, it is our job to offset as much of the inflation as possible. And I remind you that while we're guiding for below 9.6 billion at the moment, UniCredit Unlocked used to aim for 9.4 billion exit rate in 2024. And while I cannot tell you that we will be there, I can tell you that the management team ambition is to get as close to that number as possible. So our job is to continue to work on simplification, rationalization, streamlining, and bringing two common denominator of a scale of a group in the renegotiation of external contract and a number of our initiatives that are not very flamboyant, but are very effective to offset the inflation or repression on our cost base. And we think that getting excellence in operational efficiency is absolutely critical to maintain our performance and to protect '24 and '25 from the reverse winning rates.\nIgnacio Cerezo: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is Britta Schimdt of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nBritta Schimdt: Yes. Hi, there. Thanks for taking my questions. On your cost of risk guidance, when you talk about the upside to 30 to 35 basis points, are there any specific regions that you have in mind? Clearly, CE and EE did a bit better or does it -- could it also include potential releases of overlay? So is it underlying or overlay? And if it's underlying, where? And then on the RWA development, can you give a little bit more color on the market and credit risk as well as the ongoing action that you've undertaken? What measures were included in this quarter? And what do you still expect in terms of proactive measures for the rest of the year? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: Thank you, Britta. Let me start. So cost of risk. The first comment I would make is, if you look at our cost of risk across '22 and you extract Russia and overlays, we have been at single digits for now four quarters, actually five now. Okay. So the cost of risk at the moment is and remains very benign, and is very benign for us because we have a discipline origination and discipline cost of risk on new business that is offset by significant write backs, given our conservative provisioning and staging that we continue to have. If you do a simple average and you look at a cost of risk of 8 basis points in Q1 and you exclude the additional overlays and/or other things that I do not anticipate, you will find that it is very difficult for us to exceed 30 to 35, as we do an average for the rest of the year. Now this is just math. I don't know how the business will take that. But for the time being, this is the numbers. With respect to overlays, so at the moment, if I were to tell you where we see April, we see April exactly as we saw January, February, March in cost of risk. So we continue to have a benign environment. We continue to have write backs. We continue to see a benign environment. Will this change? It will absolutely change. But at the moment, it depends on when it will change and the significance of a change. As time progresses, obviously, the cost of risk of a year becomes more and more benign because the average moves in that direction. If the shock or when the shock arrives or when the worsening of cost of risk arrives, we have 1.8 billion to release to keep the cost of risk at our guidance or below our guidance. As we said in previous call, we cannot just keep the overlays going. We need to release them. So either we release them to absorb a shock and reduce any upward movement or eliminate any upward movement or release them because there is no reason to keep them, and therefore we will take the cost of risk down. So I think what we need to think in terms of cost of risk is that we are structurally lower than the past. At the moment, it is a benign environment where we benefit from write backs given our conservative provisioning. Going forward, there will be an increase. That increase will be offset by overlays. And if the increase is less than we anticipate, the cost of risk will be further reduced by overlays. With respect to RWAs, I would say the following. What we're doing on RWAs is progressive, methodical and recurrent. So the way we originate new business is very discipline, very focused and we need to originate business very simplified EVA positive. That means slower gross, but it means that all that we book flows to a profitable bottom line. If it flows to a profitable bottom line by definition, our net income generates or more than offsets the RWAs that are used to generate it. That is continuing and improving as the discipline flows through the entire system. Boosting that, we have our legacy book. Our legacy book, while very disciplined from a risk standpoint, was not very discipline from a capital allocation standpoint. As that book rolls or is reviewed or is renegotiated, we apply the same metrics. We are applying on new business to the back book. That is boosting the RWA reduction and is boosting our organic capital generation. We said at the beginning of UniCredit Unlocked not knowing well what UniCredit was capable of but we would generate 150 basis points per annum of organic capital generation that underpinned in excess of 60 billion of capital distribution. We have made 200 basis points in '21, almost 280 basis points in '22. And while we felt that it was difficult to keep the momentum, we are now confident we can do 250 basis points this year, and in excess of 150 going forward. That brings us to an organic capital generation that allows us to underpin prudently for our distribution while building capital. So that's the macro, but maybe Stefano wants to add a few points.\nStefano Porro: Yes. So on the cost of risk, Andrea already commented, maybe some data points. So the full data [ph] was mentioning 0.8 in the quarter for the group. So to give a sense is 0.3 in Germany, 0.5 in Central Europe, let's say around 1% in Italy. As alluded by Andrea, the dynamic in April is fundamentally in line with Q1. Important to consider that on the expected loss side, the new production in Italy is done at 36 basis points that is a lower expected loss than the stock and please remember 1.1 billion out of 1.8 billion of overlays are in Italy. With regards to risk weighted asset, 2 billion down in the quarter is active portfolio management action, primarily focused on EVA negative clients. So our specific initiative either not rollover, getting guarantee on repricing on active portfolio management client, vast majority of that 2 billion of credit risk is fundamentally loan dynamic that we are recommending before, better mix of the credit portfolio and a little bit of reduction of temporary different EVAs. Free below market risk is fundamentally reduction of the exposure and around 1 billion [indiscernible] from the FX hedge of the structural FX risk.\nOperator: The next question is from Benjie Creelan-Sandford of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBenjie Creelan-Sandford: Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. First question was just again on the industrial transformation plan. You're talking about, again, improving the fee base going forward. You've mentioned the product factory delivering scale and scope. So just wondering, is there any further update or details on the product factory you are prioritizing? And is there anything on your appetite to potentially bring more factories in-house going forward? The second question was just a quick follow up. Just mechanically on the overlay provisions, just based on what you've said so far, all else equal, the macro, et cetera, plays out, as you expect. Do you expect to effectively be forced by the regulator or the auditor to release those provisions this year or is that something that could sort of flow into 2024 instead? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: Thank you, Benjie. So industrial transformation and factories. So we continue to execute on the build-up of factories. So the plan is simple. What we want to have is world class factory, so to the level of quality that global banks have, but deliver for our client base, which usually is reached only by our more regional competitors. The combination of this two creates a competitive advantage, providing our clients with access to products and solutions that they would not otherwise have access to either because the regional competitor cannot scale the factory or because the global bank cannot reach them. We have been building that up either organically or through partnership and we continue on that trajectory. So you could say that advisory and capital market is an organic build. And to be very clear, we do not -- we are not planning to become a global investment bank. What we're planning to do is to offer our SMEs advisory and capital markets services that of the quality that they would not otherwise be able to benefit from. Client risk management, same thing on hedging of risk of FX, rates and commodities and that can continue. On the retail side, we are doing the same thing in asset management. So we went from maybe simplistically, but to make the point, a simple pass through between our providers in asset management and the client to creating more of a brain in asset allocation, in selection, in design of products to distribute through our network and therefore adding further value. That was phase one. Phase two has moved on identifying the part of the value chain. So the asset classes that we can produce internally while maintaining the quality of the product, that is the sense of onemarkets. That is the sense of Nova. That is the sense of [indiscernible]. It's that. And we are continuing, plotting around and going forward on the same direction. You take insurance, we have identified a partner. It's the best partner we can have. And we're integrating technologically. We are expecting the release of further product in protection from them. We are -- because of a partnership, offer training, we are offered a number of other benefits. And that is going through our network with an increased growth of protection that is growing at almost 20% year-on-year in spite of a reduction on CPI. And if I continue, I will repeat exactly the same thing for every partnership, meaning it's always a reinforcement of our capability, either internally, organically, or through partnership, but through partnership where we have a two-way relationship with our partner, and not a relationship of provider/distributor. And this continues, and I don't think we're done, I think we have a couple of years more to continue at least. With respect to overlays, I would say the following. That has nothing to do with regulator. It has to do with accounting. We have taken overlays which are done above and beyond the conservative provisioning that we have on the portfolio. So while we look at the environment and we see an environment that is relatively benign, we are worried that it may degenerate and degenerate very quickly. For that reason, we have created overlays. And we identify very clearly what those overlays are linked to; energy costs, other things, there is a whole bunch of things that we identify. Within a reasonable period of time, which I would say is this year and next, either those events occur and therefore we are releasing overlays. And therefore, the increased cost of risk is reduced by the release of overlays, keeping our risk under control, or our cost of risk under control, or those events do not occur. And I'm still obliged to release them because there is no more any reason to keep them. What I think may have been missed is that this is not a new thing. If you look at 2020, '21, '22, we have released overlays every year. The point has been that because of the volatility and because of the uncertainty and because of the emerging of new risk, we have released them and rebuilt them. And therefore, you net-net saw no change in '21 and an increase in '22. But we have released the legacy overlays we had that we had built in 2020. This time, we don't think -- we don't expect new unexpected shock beyond the one we have in the overlays, so we don't expect that we will need to rebuild. And that's why we're going to flow through the P&L over the next two years.\nStefano Porro: Benjie, maybe one point. The 1.8 billion are on top on the IFRS 9 macro LLP, so as correctly highlighted by Andrea are fundamentally connected to inflation and high energy costs and these are the two relevant drivers that we will look at in the next couple of years.\nBenjie Creelan-Sandford: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrea Filtri of Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Filtri: Yes, thank you. Very straightforward ones actually for me. The first is on the updated shareholder remuneration policy, if you're maintaining the same split between dividend and buyback? And the second is, what is the probability you attribute to the introduction of an Italian banking tax? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: Okay. Thank you, Andrea. So the shareholder remuneration policy, as of now, we're keeping it unchanged, meaning 35% of net income is going to cash dividend, and the rest is going to share buybacks, as of now. I think we look at the value we generate with our share buyback. And therefore, depending where we go, we may change that percentage in favor of cash. Secondly, what I would say is, we realize that an increasing number of our investors expects a gently upward increasing of our cash dividends per share. And therefore, we look at the dividend yield. And we take all of these things in consideration to potentially make changes. We do recognize that once we change a percentage upward 35, 40 or whatever, it stays there as a minimum floor. You remember that when we had the shock from the invasion of Ukraine, we suspended the share buyback for prudency reason. We didn't touch the dividend. And we actually said that we would calculate the dividend on net income, excluding the shock for Russia. So we understand that the cash portion needs to be defended as much as we can reasonably. With respect to the probability of the government introduction of a banking tax in Italy, I think your guest is better than mine. I just know that it is unlikely to be part of the current introduction and that the discussion has been postponed. I don't think the probabilities are 100%. I think there is a discussion, and we'll see where that discussion takes us.\nOperator: The next question is from Azzurra Guelfi of Citi. Please go ahead.\nAzzurra Guelfi: Hi. Good morning. Two question from me, one on loans. So when I look at the development of the lending \u201camong the different divisions,\u201d Italy seems the one to have suffered more than the other. Can you give us some color on that? Is it modeling for the effort on the repricing? Is it customer driven? Any color on that will be great. And the other one is on a broader regulatory potential review in terms of liquidity ratio, or anything that could be reviewed in terms of guarantee of deposit. And if this is something that you are considering when you are assuming a decrease on the systemic charges in the coming years? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: So maybe I'll start on the loans with a more macro dynamics of our lending. So I would call it the dynamic of our deployment of capital is driven solely by our focus on EVA positive deployment of capital. In Italy, you see a greater impact, because we feel that lending in certain segment, take mortgages as one, take large corporates as another is not recognizing the risk reward. And therefore, the profitability of a segment is not to the level that we think covers the cost of equity. I'm generalizing, it is not true everywhere. But as a result of that, we are showing a declining market share in mortgages and a declining market share in the corporate sector. And given that those two segments are large, a mortgage is larger than a consumer loan and a large corporate loan is larger than a small corporate loan, you're seeing a compression. We think that that dynamic is about to find a floor, because obviously as we have reassessed, we will not continue to lose forever, i.e. we're finding a place where we're happy with the client base and with the portfolio that we have, and the decline will stop. At that point, the gross in other segments like consumer lending or SMEs will be more visible. Now I'll pass it to Stefano.\nStefano Porro: Yes. You have also a question in relation to pricing that was partially mentioned before, so when we're looking to the pricing of the new production, so for example new near and long term [ph] production, declined rate on the front book is definitely higher than the back book. So what is expiring was either repaid. But also when you are looking to the client spread, so taking also into consideration let's say the funding costs, we are currently repricing, so around 20 basis points more, especially in Germany and in Central Europe, less so in Italy. So still when you're looking into the client spread in Italy, the new production is few basis points lower than the spread of the back book. But within that, the situation will normalize in Italy over time. With regards to systemic charges and the potential, let's say, implication in relation to the charges of single regional fund and deposit guarantee scheme. Before Andrea was highlighting the expectation for '24, the expectation for '24 is a reduction in relation to the single resolution fund component. Already this year, there was a reduction for next year. We are expecting a reduction of few 100 million. Considering the overall liquidity situation and liquidity framework of European banks, currently we are not expecting any change in relation for this approach. While for the deposit guarantee scheme standpoint, we are currently exploiting, let's say, a slight dynamic of the charges in '24 versus '23.\nOperator: The next question is from Antonio Reale of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAntonio Reale: Good morning, everyone. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions for me please, the first one on capital and the second one on mitigating book NII. Starting with the first one, you've generated 100 basis points of organic capital this quarter, which is impressive. Your guiding for risk weighted assets to drop below 300 billion by year end. And of course, we know you gave guidance and distribution on earnings. So your capital is going to continue to move further away from the 12.5%, 13% target range you had. And admittedly, it's a lot more capital than you can consider distributed. So I wonder where does your strategic priorities stand here aside of distribution which is very clear? That's my first question. The second one, there\u2019s a lot of focus on banks hedging strategies. If you have a replicating book of 170 billion of roughly [indiscernible] with a relatively low back book yield, is there any of the investment contribution in your full year NII guidance? Or are you just focusing mostly on the commercial side? Can you share any more details on the contribution? What the back book yield looks like? And what could be the potential benefits going forward? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: So I'll start with capital. So at the moment, we are clearly much more organic capital generative than we had expected. This allows us both to be a positive outlier in terms of our distribution and, and I underline the and, continue to increase capital. So not only we're not using our capital access to underpin our distribution, but we're also continuing to increase capital. Why are we doing that? And what is the plan? Well, number one, we're doing that because we're already an outlier in distribution and was just a point, but until it's fully appreciated, continuing to go further and further does not seem to have a lot of impact. The second thing is that we are in an uncertain environment. There is a lot of volatility. And while we see a positive base case, I continue to say that the only certain thing is uncertainty and we don't want to be found on the back foot. The third reason, and probably the most important one, is that for as long as our organic capital generation allows us to beat the sector on distributions, that's great. But we want a, let's say, recurrent sustainable level of distributions. And as I have said before, our excess capital can play a role anytime we get a shock or if our organic capital generation starts going down, which we do not anticipate this year and next, to underpin regeneration and keep the distribution at least at the same level that we have this year for the foreseeable future. So what we offer investors is for organic capital generation underpinned and through a gradual release of our excess capital, if and when it is necessary, a foreseeable future, lesser risk level of distribution at the level that we have today or higher. That's why we took floors. Not forever, but certainly for the foreseeable future. There is no other big plan about it. It is what it is at the moment. And that's where we take it. I will pass the replicating to --\nStefano Porro: So replicating portfolio, you're right. We have around 170 billion. The duration is around five years. Let's say that every year, we have a rollover of around 10%. And so every year, the front book rate that we can get is definitely higher than the back book. This is included in the guidance of over 12.6 billion in 2023. And that's the reason why I was also commenting before that even in case of short-term rates cut, for example, next year, we will have, however, a contribution of few hundred million of euro from the replicating version in '24.\nAntonio Reale: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Giovanni Razzoli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGiovanni Razzoli: Good morning. And thank you for your very detailed presentation. My first question is a more strategic field. I would say [indiscernible] proved more resilient than what you expected in the last couple of years, even the three major macro shocks that we had; so the comp [ph], the war and the energy inflation. And you likely saw -- already two years ago, you were [indiscernible] role with integral. I was wondering whether you think that medium term, it makes sense to allocate even more capital to the market also like significant sensitivity to rising rates, we have seen that Italy is one of the [indiscernible] describing accelerating the most and the deposit costs are more stable, either organically or via external growth? That's my first question. And my second question, if you can clarify sort of the evolution of the customer deposits in Q1, if I'm not mistaken at the country level, they were down. You mentioned that in Germany there was a one-off, if I'm not mistaken, if you can please clarify these? And whether at group level, there was a contribution from the [indiscernible]? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: Thank you, Giovanni. So allocation of capital and more resilience, so I think the way we look at it is very simple. As we now have a granular assessment of the profitability of a deployment of our capital both by macro location through regions and more granular within every country. Every time that we see that we have an opportunity to deploy profitably above our cost of equity, which has increased, we do that. So there is -- given our overall capital position, we have absolutely no restriction in deploying the capital correctly in all of our geographies. The only restrictions are discipline on risk and discipline on returns. Beyond that, we're doing exactly what you're saying. But obviously, discipline on risk, discipline on return, and we will continue this way. And we find opportunity because others are retrenching, maintaining discipline on risk, discipline on returns, we will continue to do so. So you should anticipate that we try to do that. With respect to -- and obviously, as I said before, you do not see that because some of the growth that we're doing is obscured by the optimization of improvement of efficiency of our loan portfolio, as we get out of lending position that are unprofitable. And those mask some of the growth that we're already delivering. The second part on the deposits, and then I'll pass maybe more detail to Stefano, I think it's important that we look at deposit and liquidity in two ways. So if you are considered a flight to quality bank, you can benefit to that in two ways. One, you try to attract as many deposit as you can. Two, you try to improve your profitability as much as you can. And if you think about it, what is happening in the market is that depositors are giving a greater value to banks that are better capitalized, better covered, more liquid, less risky. So as it's normal, but we haven't seen that in many, many years, depositor will say, I'll take a slightly lower deposit base rate because this bank will give me the money back, simplifying okay. So given that our loan to deposit ratio is below 90%, we have no need to hover deposits. We look at them closely, but we have no need to press on increasing the deposits. But maximizing or the improvement or the maintenance of our pass through or rather maintaining our pass through as low as possible is critical. And why is it critical? Not only for current profitability, but because we will have a rate reversal, we will have a rate reversal. That rate reversal will occur sometimes in '24. We hope the second half, it could happen earlier. At that point, the pass through that will have been considered is the pass through that will exist. So you will have lesser rates, a higher pass through margin gets crushed. Effect number one. Effect number two, the costs that have not been defended and have increased are not going to go down just because inflation goes down. They're going to stay there. Revenue down, cost up, crush. Thirdly, the cost of risk will come at the tail end of a cycle as it always does. So revenue down, cost up, cost of risk up, crush. So what we're focusing on relentlessly is to avoid that and making our profitability sustainable in '24, '25 and beyond. How are we doing that? Defend the pass through in as much as possible. So the NII crushes less, develop further the fees through the transformation of our factory, keep the cost down, and if possible, lower. So when the revenues go down, our costs are not found to be higher, and keeping all of our provision and buffers so that when cost of risk goes up, we have buffers to offset it. In this way, we should be able to maintain a much greater degree of the profitability we have found for the first time in 15 years in the foreseeable future. And all of this is connected in such fashion.\nStefano Porro: So I'll give you some data points. So it's important to distinguish end of period versus the average. So end of period Q1 versus Q4, deposits are down 12 billion. 7 billion is Germany, 6 billion is Italy. 10 billion out of 12 billion is corporate, mainly large corporate. So as commented more than once for pricing reason and for some transaction done by these corporates. When we are looking on the other end on the average deposits, so average Q1 versus average Q4, I think it's a better metric to avoid some volatility. The deposits are down 8 billion, but in this case is 6 billion for Germany. Same reason, large corporate. And Italy is down by just 1 billion.\nGiovanni Razzoli: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Delphine Lee of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDelphine Lee: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to go back to NII and I just heard your comments. Just in terms of the outlook for '24, given that -- because data you\u2019re assuming 42.5%, and based on the sensitivity 1 percentage increasing, the probability is quite high. So it sounds like we're going to get a 1.5 billion potential headwind from the probability to increase. Just wondering on the other moving parts, do you expect anything to offset that? I know you mentioned a couple of 100 million for application portfolio, but just wondering if it is possible to maintain NII flat next year or even increasing? And then my second question is regarding capital and other big dynamics. You talked a little bit about how you\u2019re optimizing the legacy portfolio which is not capital efficient. Is it possible to get a bit of -- just a flavor of the size of that legacy book just to understand how much are there mitigation we can get in coming years? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: So, thank you, Delphine. First of all, let me be clear that the impact on our NII is an industry thing. It is not specific to UniCredit. If anything, we think we are a little bit more asymmetrical on the way down, meaning we are going to suffer a little bit less on the way down. Why do we think that? Number one, because as we're demonstrating, we're capable of managing the pass through because of our strengths and liquidity position a lot better than average. And that will help us when rates reverse. So if we are at that level of pass through, then we expect the industry to be on average higher, or we will be below that level of pass through. So that's the first thing. The second thing that underpins our NII symmetrically is the replicating portfolio, because we have replicated less in the past and we can now benefit for replicating more in the future, or rolling further in the future. And the new loans are obviously stripping at better rates. So these things will reduce the shock. The other thing that will reduce the shock is, as I said before, a lesser drag from the continued optimization of our portfolio by pulling back from segments that we think are EVA disruptive that will not continue forever. And when you stop that, the benefit from what we're doing in consumer finance and we're doing on SME loan and in other places will come much more clearly visible. In any case, our expectation at the moment is that we see NII peeking between second and third quarter. And we see, because of the conjunction of rates in Europe getting to their maximum level and pass through being higher, but not as high as the exit rate of a year. From there, it will follow a trend in our opinion where rates will be held at that level for a certain period of time, and then will decrease while pass through will start converging. The speed of those two things is very unclear and depends on the strength of the economy and on the dynamics of inflation. So we can have a scenario -- the scenario is in the presentation, but it can change. With respect to how we are offsetting, because what you're saying is correct. If all of that happens, banks will have a very significant reversal of the NII tailwinds quite soon, relatively soon, is continue to working on the factories to boost our fees. So part of the boosting fees will occur physiologically, because when rates drop, our asset management fees are going to improve. Part is due to better integration in protection, new products in protection, what we're doing in payments, et cetera, et cetera, that should be giving some tailwinds from I would say the second part of '24 onwards to our fees. The other thing that we're doing is obviously driving costs down and keeping our cost of risk as low a level and keeping buffer to protect it going into '24 and '25. So I do think that for us, the real challenge or the real ambition is not so much what we're going to generate and make in 2023. In a certain way, while we're doing well, the dies are cast. What is the challenge and the ambition is to be able to protect as much as this newfound profitability on a sustainable basis in '24 and '25. And that's what we have been doing through the transformation and the lines of defense starting the summer of last year. And we will continue to do.\nStefano Porro: Yes, you had a question in relation to which is, let's say, the part of the portfolio that we can still focusing on for risk weighted asset efficiency measures. So let's break down into our portfolio. So if you look at our risk weighted asset and their related credit risk, around 70 billion are the retail portfolio, 180 billion is the corporate portfolio. The main focusing on the corporate portfolio, so on the 180 billion, let's say, that you have 10% of that that you can optimize is around \u20ac18 billion. It's clear that not everything done via reduction, because we can also work on that portfolio via repricing working with the clients and so on. So this is more or less a portion of that can be also securitized and so on. So in your eyes between '23 and '24, that is the portion of the portfolio that we'll be looking at.\nDelphine Lee: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Hugo Cruz of KBW. Please go ahead.\nHugo Cruz: Hi. Thank you. I just have a question around the tradeoff between buybacks and M&A. Have you discussed that with the regulator? And do you think that if you have a large deal where the performance CET1 ratio of UniCredit doesn't change, do you think the regulator might still raise issues with a buyback execution risk? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: Sorry, Hugo. I missed or we missed the first part of your question. The tradeoff between -- can you repeat, please?\nHugo Cruz: Sorry, between M&A and buybacks, if you have discussed that with the regulator?\nAndrea Orcel: I don't think we have a debate with regulators on tradeoff between buyback and M&A. I think the tradeoff between buyback and M&A is based on value. And I think you can mathematically look at it this way. Let's suppose just hypothetically, you have a cash acquisition, you're buying earnings, you're buying a certain capital position, you're buying a certain liquidity, you're buying that and you're integrating the group with the same share count. Alternatively, you have the same earnings of UniCredit with a lower share count. At that point, which one is your better investment? That's as simple as that. If you cut off all the strategy of a noisy [ph] industrial, which one is the better investment? I would argue, but if you look at the progression of our results, which we obviously believe in, buying our shares has been the better investment, heads on shoulders [ph] and continues to be. If that were to change adjusted for execution risk, et cetera, we may act differently. As far as the regulators are concerned, I will not answer, but the significance of our distribution is looked at considering both our profitability, our organic capital generation, our starting and ending level of CET1, and they're all in our favors. And I guess any M&A that hypothetically we were to look at will be looked at on the impact on the bank, and its risk and capital base. I don't think we're looking at it in any different way from them, but I don't want to answer for them.\nHugo Cruz: Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: Thank you very much, Hugo.\nOperator: Mr. Orcel, this was the last question. Back to you for any closing remarks you may have.\nAndrea Orcel: Thank you, everyone, for following our results call and we'll see you at the next quarter. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining. The conference is now over. You may disconnect your telephones. Thank you.",

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Thank you, Magda, and thank you all for joining us today. The first quarter of this year has been a notable one for our industry. The economic shocks and unexpected fragility we have witnessed across the U.S. and in Switzerland raise question about both banks' strengths and how they're operating day to day. These were idiosyncratic and specific to a segment of our industry with limited read across to European banking. However, they do highlight the need beyond regulation for banks to be managed efficiently, effectively and responsibly, and continuing to strive for excellence, principles which are at the heart of UniCredit Unlocked.  While the recent approval of our \u20ac3.3 billion share buyback and 1.25 billion early redemption of AT1 evidence, UniCredit's specific strengths and resilience, the results I will present to you today further underscores UniCredit's transformation, a journey, which whilst accelerated is far from being over. Every day, we continue to unlock internal value, and today's results are just one of many additional milestones to come. We're winning and are well on our way to becoming the bank for Europe.  Let's start our presentation. We have delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of profitable growth and the best first quarter ever for the group. UniCredit Unlocked is releasing our banks potential and the management of our three levers is delivering financial success. We now move into phase two of our industrial transformation. We have outperformed our prudent macro assumption. Our alpha actions and strong lines of defense have further propelled our results and will position us to outperform in all environments in the future.  We are upgrading our 2023 guidance and setting a new floor for the future, underpinned by the actions we are proactively taking to prepare for an eventual, less supportive macro environment. We continue to build a sustainable competitive advantage, resilient and growing results and a robust balance sheet. All this amounts to an Unlocked UniCredit bank focused on continuously seeking to improve itself and create value.  This is the ninth consecutive quarter of profitable growth and the best first quarter ever delivering a 2.1 billion net profit, 20.4% RoTE at 13% and 3.4 billion organic capital generation. The supportive macro is further boosted by our industrial transformation, and our operating performance is protected by our lines of defense. We feel that these two levers are not often taken into consideration. We are investing and strengthening our bank for the future.  We're investing in the network through hires, upskilling through training and the rollout of the UniCredit University across the group and in our technology through exactly the same levers. We're extracting inefficiency from our complex organization, our complex processes, way of working, products and technology. This is about constantly transforming our bank into one fit for the future. Our results show that this is working with record performance across the board.  Net revenues are up 57% year-on-year. This is especially impactful given the targeting of profitable quality gross, so a gross that shows risk discipline and is EVA positive. Costs were reduced 1% and RWA 9%, in spite of growth, inflation and our investment in the future. The strengths of our operational and capital levers are shown, respectively, in a best-in-class 39.2% cost income ratio and 7.7% net revenue on RWA. These are also our best ever.  As a result, our return on tangible equity exceeded 20% at a 13% CET1, which is more comparable versus our peers as it extracts some of our excess capital. And we generated 111 basis points or 3.4 billion of capital organically reaching 16.1% in CTE1. The strategy we're implementing is uniting our bank as one franchise capable of delivering consistent quality, profitable growth over the long term.  As such, we are upgrading our net profit guidance too in excess of 6.5 billion for 2023. This is pre AT1 and cashes coupon of 400 million, but post 300 million of restructuring charges as we continue to strive for operating excellence. Accordingly, we're also upgrading our distribution guidance to equal or in excess of 5.75 billion.  Let's turn to the next slide. Our value proposition is simple. We are reengineering our bank into one with a sustainable competitive advantage. We are already well underway in the execution of UniCredit Unlocked and are now determined to go further. We have a clear vision to set a new benchmark for banking and be the bank for Europe. Our winning strategy is client-centric, focused on our strengths and continuously striving for excellence.  We have a four-pillar industrial plan, which reinforced our commercial machine and will now improve our operating machine. Our three financial levers will continue to deliver alpha-driven results and create value over the long term. So that is how we win the right way together. This value has already been within UniCredit, but we are able to release it now because we have established a common vision and are united by our distinctive culture. Our people are striving for excellence, and it is this which enable us to capitalize on our unique and irreplaceable model. Next slide. Our strategic plan UniCredit Unlocked continues to leverage our inherent strengths and unlocking net value. We have 15 million clients across Europe and our unique gateway to the continent. We have 75,000 people in 13 leading local banks, 40% of which are in A or better rated geographies. We have two product factories and an evolving ecosystem of best-in-class partners, which enables us to deliver top quality solutions and products. We aim to grow by combining our world class factories and our local reach to provide products and services that competitor cannot replicate.  Our digital machine is resilient, and we have a strong data set. We're investing in both, to become a truly digital data-driven bank, positively impacting our clients and employees journeys. All of this is anchored by our shared ambition, principles and values. We strive for excellence and lead by example in ESG, always aiming to fulfill our purpose of empowering communities to progress.  We will now take a closer look to our industrial transformation plan in the next slide. Phase one of our industrial transformation plan is well advanced. This is about reinforcing our commercial machine. It has brought us closer to our clients and set the base for new run rate. Our people are unified. Our organization is empowered within a clear risk and capital framework. And we are integrating our frontline and product factories.  Phase two is just underway. This is about significantly improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our operating machine, which we are reengineering to further support our business. Our technology and product factories deliver scale and scope. We're simplifying our processes to increase speed and reduce cost.  We continue to broaden our product offering, automate and digitalize to enhance client experience. Our commercial machine now shows the right drive, the right mindset and an ability to deliver for clients. And we're just started. We now intend to support it with a more efficient operating machine. The combination of these two is what will create further value.  Next slide. We are already a different bank. Our transformation is well advanced, but we're far from being done. This slide highlights some of the many milestones we have already achieved with many more to come.  Let's turn to Slide 8. We aim to deliver differentiated financial results in any macro environment, thanks to our relentless focus on alpha. We're executing on all our three levers of cost, net revenue and capital. We continue to reduce non-business cost to invest while creating positive operational jaws where both revenues and cost contribute. We have grown revenue while maintaining structurally lower cost of risk. We're on course to achieve sustainable best-in-class RWA efficiency, all coming together to drive superior profitability [indiscernible] enabling outsize distribution.  As regards to beta, we were prepared for was one of moderate NII growth and high inflation. The scenario we currently face is one of improved rates and better GDP growth. We are boosting the supportive macro through our industrial transformation. We are protecting our operating performance with our lines of defense. We're therefore capable of differentiated results in all environments.  Next slide. Our results speak for themselves. Our gross revenues are up 18%, while our cost of risk has declined 93% to 8 basis points, thanks to the rationalization of our Russian provision, no longer needing to accrue overlays, and our strong asset quality and coverage which resulted in significant write backs. Our operating leverage is a key feature of these results and is now among best in class, as is our capital.  We note our 35% improvement in gross operating profit year-over-year. This confirms both the increasing strengths of our business and of our lines of defense, which as intended are currently propelling our profitability and organic capital generation. All of our business areas are contributing to this excellent performance.  We continue to create exceptional value for our shareholders. Our return on tangible equity at 13% CET1 reached 20.4%, increasing not only because of positive macro but also and more importantly, thanks to our ongoing industrial transformation and our lines of defense at work. Share buybacks continue to further enhance our value creation, especially given our low valuation. Note our tangible book value per share growth of 22% year-on-year. The 2022 share buyback currently in execution, combined with improved guidance, will further underpin these numbers going forward.  Let's turn to the next slide. Our product factories are growing organically and through partnership, strengthening the level of cooperation towards a full service client-centric bank. They are the engine of our capital-light revenue generation at 2.5 billion. We have begun to unlock the value of these factories, but there is more to come as we continue to invest in them. Corporate solutions grew revenue 3% year-on-year, an excellent result given the strong Q1 of last year because of the market situation then. Client risk management, transactions and payments and more recently, advisory and capital markets continue to drive growth. This compensate for the rightsizing of specialized lending due to the TLTRO reimbursement and the removal of Euribor flooring.  We're investing organically in advisory to capture market recovery. We are rationalizing and further enhancing our payment solutions through partnerships. Individual solutions have been more negatively affected by the environment year-over-year, but they are now accelerating quarter-over-quarter. Protection continues to be a standout while life insurance, which in our case includes mostly unit linked and not [indiscernible], and funds and portfolio management are recovering. The expansion of our nonlife product offering beyond CPI is bearing fruit.  Italy; our Italian business had yet another outstanding quarter, demonstrating its ability to deliver sustained quality profitable gross. Net revenues were up 13% year-on-year, gross revenue 20%. This was driven by NII up 66%, thanks to strict management of the pass through, thanks to our strengths. While fees suffered year-on-year, they were up 8% quarter-on-quarter thanks to strong performance in protection and asset under management sales.  Costs were reduced 2%, thanks to our continued focus on simplification and streamlining whilst funding circa 200 new hires in the network. RWAs were reduced by 15%. As a result, we achieved our best ever leading operating and capital efficiency with a 36.1 cost income ratio and 9% net revenue over RWAs. Profit before tax in Italy was up 29% to 1.3 billion. RoAC exceeded 25% and the region contributed 50 basis points or 1.6 billion of capital organically to the group. Our continued innovation in data was recognized by the Italian Banking Association as well as our innovation in products, for example, in home and health insurance. Finally, we continue to support communities by investing in our branches and restarting purchase of tax credit for Superbonus. ESG underpins all that we do reflected in our award for Best ESG Bank in Italy and in Europe 2023.  Germany; Germany's structural transformation continues powering excellent results. Net revenues were up 13% year-on-year, gross revenues were up 11. This was driven by NII up 8% and fees up 1% with an acceleration of a latter quarter-over-quarter. Costs were reduced nearly 6% while the ongoing transformation more than -- with the ongoing transformation more than compensating for inflation and investment.  We expect significant further efficiency through '23 and '24. RWAs were down 6% as well. Germany also reached its best ever operating and capital efficiency with a 40.4% cost income ratio and a 7.4% net revenue on RWA ratio. Profit before tax landed up 65%, up 700 million. RoAC reached 19.5%, more than twice its cost of equity.  The region delivered 30 basis points or 900 million of capital organically. We're supporting SMEs in their ESG transition by matching platform from green tech startups and have extended our smart banking model to micro businesses. We extended lending to medical services in underserviced regions to play our role in the community.  Central Europe; Central Europe has also set a new improved run rate. Net revenues were up 23% year-on-year, gross revenue 27%. This was driven by NII up 43%. Fees were stable quarter-over-quarter. Costs were also down 1% driven by our continued transformation in Austria. Our focus on operating and capital efficiency was reflected in a 39.8% cost income ratio for the region and 6.6% net revenue on RWA ratio.  Profit before tax was up 72% at 400 million. RoAC was 15.6% and the region delivered 9 basis points or 300 million of capital organically. Each bank is progressing its industrial transformation, while continuing to support clients' green and social transition. A significant progress in retail digitalization, Austria has enabled all startup products in mobile, while Czech Republic and Slovakia is now acquiring one-third of new clients remotely. We excel in our markets. UniCredit Hungary was awarded as the best international private bank in Hungary, while UniCredit Czech Republic was recognized as top acquirer in the Czech market.  Eastern Europe; Eastern Europe continues to deliver record profitable gross. Net revenues were up 39% year-over-year, gross revenue 32%. This was powered by both NII up 41% and fees up 6%. Cost gross was contained to 6%, less than half inflation and in spite of continued significant investments in digitalization and automation in the region. Our focus on operating and capital efficiency was reflected in a 34.6% cost income ratio and 9.3% net revenue on RWA ratio.  Profit before tax landed at 400 million. RoAC was 33.1%. And the region delivered 11 basis points or 300 million of capital organically. Our strong profitable growth is supported by each bank in the region. Croatia, Bulgaria, Bosnia reaffirm their market leadership position, introducing new products to help enhance the value of customer saving and improving overall quality of customer care.  Romania and Serbia further accelerated their retail growth and drove best practice solution in micro business, all in addition to their existing strengths in the corporate sector. Social impact banking initiatives have been rolled out across the region, as well as the first ever government bond issuance and numerous award.  Russia. We continue to take a clear and conservative approach to Russia, maintaining our support for Western companies while looking for opportunities to continue to derisk, minimizing current and future potential losses to the group. In the last year, we have decisively resized our operation, substantially reduced our exposure and increased our coverage of risk, both locally and cross border.  We have proactively enhanced our lines of defense and the impact from our extreme loss assessment has been reduced from 128 basis points to 38 basis points year-on-year, while group CET1 pro forma for an extreme loss impact has increased from 13.3% to 15.7%. We will continue in this direction.  Let's turn to the next slide. Our robust balance sheet is underpinned by broad-based increased strengths. We continue to see the visible outcomes of a conservative approach to capital, to asset quality, to liquidity and to interest rate risk. Our CET1 ratio has been driven by our high quality capital stock, transformed organic capital generation and sustainable distribution, all part of our long-term approach.  Our cost of risk is driven by a number of factors, including our high quality asset portfolio, low and higher quality NPEs, sound proactive staging, and superior coverage. In addition, we have substantially enhanced our overlays to best-in-class, enabling us to either protect or propel our operating results going forward and strengthen our risk discipline across the business. Finally, our liquidity buffers are strong. This is due to our high quality and diversified deposit base, our strong liquidity ratios, prudent asset and liability management, and finally our significant net positive exposure to ECB.  Next slide. We benefit from the highest CET1 with lowest dependence on AT1 which we continuously strengthened by best-in-class organic capital generation. This combined with distribution that works best-in-class continue to be set significantly below our organic capital generation results in an ever strengthening CET1. We do not believe many can claim that.  Next slide. Our solid credit portfolio means that our cost of risk is structurally lower than in the past. And we are prepared to meet future headwinds. Our gross NPE stock has declined to 12.6 billion with a much improved mix, three quarters being UTPs. Our net NPE stock is 6.5 billion. The bank is also surpassing peers when it comes to staging and coverage.  We continue to have the highest stock of overlays at circa 1.8 billion that will either protect or propel our result as they are released and they will be. Finally, we continue our discipline approach on new business with our expected loss of 26 basis points, 7 basis points lower than that on our stock, excluding Russia.  Next slide. Our robust liquidity profile allows us to better manage pass-through, balancing the interest of our clients with current and future profitability. Our deposit base is sticky, diversified, stable and high quality. Our liquidity ratios are all strong. We maintain a prudent approach to ALM, managing liquidity and interest rate risk separately. Excess liquidity is placed with ECB and this is well in excess of our residual TLTRO borrowings.  I will now handover to Stefano Porro, who will provide you with more detail on our excellent results of the first quarter. Stefano?"

        "text": "Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 22. Before I take you through the first quarter '23 results, please note that my comments are based on a year-on-year comparison, that is first quarter '23 versus first quarter '22, unless otherwise noted. Let's look at the P&L in more detail, starting with revenue. As a reminder, the majority of systemic charges are always booked in the first quarter.  This year, they amounted to 640 million, a decrease of 11% year-on-year, mainly driven by a lower single resolution fund contribution, partly offset by the tax on extra bank profits in Hungary, as flagged before, which was 49 million this quarter. In first quarter '23, we generated 5.9 billion of revenue, up 18% thanks to net interest up 1 billion. Excluding TLTRO, tiering and excess liquidity fee which no longer benefit from, revenue is up 23%.  Please note that trading no longer includes client hedging fees, which relate to the markup on client hedging transaction where the markup can be immediately locked. These are now reported under fees as they are characteristic aligned with other fee lines. Trading was ELF [ph] at 0.5 billion in first quarter '23, the lion's share of which is fixed income, currency and commodity business. This is 15% lower compared to a very strong first quarter of '22 that benefited from realized gains of the investment portfolio.  Let's turn to the next slide. Let me share some highlights of UniCredit's strong balance sheet and a robust liquidity position. Our favorable liquidity position starts with the structure of our balance sheet and a loan to deposit ratio well below 100% at a sound 90% where we're resilient and diversified the deposit base. More than 80% of our deposits are from retail and SME clients and are granular.  For retail, the average balance is below \u20ac20,000 and about 70% is guaranteed. Retail deposits are mostly sight, almost entirely so in Italy, while the term deposit share in Germany is higher at about 25%. Our deposit market share across the group is generally stable, while the decrease in volumes in the quarter mirrors our market trends and our focus on pricing. Thanks to our superior liquidity profile and balance sheet strength, we are in a position to be able to do so.  The pricing focus and single ticket large corporate use of excess cash explains the volume decline quarter-on-quarter. At the same time, retail deposits are only slightly down as some clients diversified their savings and shifted to assets under custody products, for example, BTPs in Italy. The clients are keeping their asset with us and our TFAs are up 7 billion in the quarter as a result of strong net assets under custody sales and the market performance.  Total deposits are still well above pre-2020 levels. We expect the overall deposit volume to continue slightly declining in 2023 as there is further rotation to asset under custody or asset under management, and as we prioritize pricing management and quality NII. This is also reflected in our deposit beta, which I will discuss in more detail later. We have about 220 billion liquid assets of which some 190 billion are regulatory HQLA.  The bonds in our investment portfolios are swapped to floating so we have virtually no interest rate duration risk. The large liquidity buffer translated to strong regulatory ratio. At first quarter '23, our liquidity coverage ratio was 163%, net stable funding ratio about 130%. The managerial target for LCR is at 125% to 150% range, and will also be met net of our TLTRO repayment in June.  We're in a comfortable position for our remaining funding plan this year. We have limited need for TLAC/MREL funding and no need to issue additional Tier 1 in the foreseeable future, thanks to our very high 633 basis points CET1 fully loaded MDA buffer, pro forma for the recently announced call of our 1.25 billion additional Tier 1.  Let's turn to Slide 24, and focus again on the quarter. Net interest income was 3.3 billion, up 10% quarter-on-quarter net of TLTRO, which no longer contributes to NII and was 0.4 billion in fourth quarter '22. We continue to experience a positive net interest dynamic driven by higher loan rates and still low deposit beta, net interest margin at 2%, up 11 basis points in first quarter '23.  Customer loan rates are up 66 basis points in the quarter across our region, leveraging on higher interest rates and thanks to our commercial action, which also led to front book margins being slightly higher than back book in the quarter. Average client loan volumes relevant for net interest are down 3.4 billion in the quarter, driven by Italy, mainly loans for ME and retail mortgages.  Client's appetite for lending as in general declined in the first quarter across Italy and Germany, while loan volumes are supported by 2.5 billion in USG lending in the quarter as we continue supporting our clients during transaction. Average client loans are stable year-on-year with focus on profitable clients, despite active portfolio management including the reduction of low performing businesses. Demand for loans is expected to be curtailed on the back of higher rates and we will concentrate on more profitable capital efficient loans.  The increase of customer deposit rate is limited to 21 basis points in the quarter, while the average Euribor three months was up 86 basis points. The IR customer deposit rate at 67 basis points is mainly driven by Germany and Central Europe, where our corporate business and IR term deposit composition play a prominent role. The rate also depends on the country.  In Italy, for example, where we have the higher stock of deposit, the customer deposit rate is 12 basis points, higher versus last quarter at 25 basis points. Our deposit pricing is below the system across most of our regions. Average commercial deposit decreased by 8 billion in Q1 '23, mainly in Germany, driven by the single ticket item I mentioned earlier, and it was also related to clients using part liquidity for corporate transactions. At the same time, deposits in Central Europe were stable and slightly grew in Eastern Europe. Average client deposit volumes are up 9 billion year-on-year.  Regarding the deposit dynamics this year, we expect stability for the less rate sensitive part of our client base, in particular retail and small businesses, while we are focusing on the deposit beta. Corporates will continue to be lumpy. We expect clients to keep investing or shifting the [indiscernible] excess liquidity to other assets. Let's take a closer look at our updated net interest outlook and sensitivity on the next slide, 25. We've updated our managerial net interest income guidance, considering the latest deposit beta and rate assumptions. Based on a 3.5% ECB deposit facility rate by the end of Q2 '23 and the remaining stable thereafter, and the deposit beta around 40% at the end of the year, we expect and improve fully our 23 NII guidance of over 12.6 billion. This is mainly thanks to a better average deposit beta for the year at around 30%.  The observed deposit beta for the group for both sight and term deposit in Q1 '23 is about 22%. The deposit beta for retail and corporate clients is at around 11% and 37%, respectively. This slight increase by 2 percentage points in the quarter is mainly driven by Germany and Central Europe. While in Italy, we still have a low level of circa 10%. We continue to see a shift from sight to term deposit, in particular in Germany; however, sight for the group is still about 8% of our retail deposit and nearly 70% of our corporate deposit base.  We actively monitor the client behaviors and level of competition and we'll see how the upcoming TLTRO maturities impact the market. The net interest income sensitivity for a 1 percentage point of deposit beta is about 120 million at current rates and deposit volume assumptions. The net interest income impact from ECB deposit facility rate increase of 50 basis points is over 0.3 billion, which also depends on how client behavior and competitive dynamics develop. If the ECB starts reducing short-term rates, our deposit replicating portfolio which is factoring into our NII guidance will continue to support our net interest income.  Let's turn to Slide 26. Fees in Q1 '23 were 2 billion, down 2% year-on-year, mainly as lower asset under management impacted investment fees in Italy. Quarter-on-quarter, fees are up 11% thanks to an increase across all three categories with investment and financing fees in Italy and Germany particularly strong. We are well diversified and balanced, as you can see from the following year-on-year development of our different component parts of fees.  Investment fees were down 8%, as more than 8% reduced asset under management stock negatively impacted management fees and lower market levels combined with conservative client portfolio management led to lower asset under management upfront fees. This is partially mitigated by better assets under custody fees, thanks to certificate placement and some shift from deposit to asset under custody.  Investment fees quarter-on-quarter are up 13%, thanks to a recovery in assets under management upfront fees at 246 million in Q1 '23. Financing fees are down 4% due to higher securitization costs stemming from our active portfolio management strategy and lower credit protection insurance linked to retail mortgages in Italy. Financing fees are up 24% quarter-on-quarter, mainly driven by a recovering global capital market activity following a seasonally low Q4 and also loan fees in Germany. Transactional fees were up 7%, thanks to payment and card fees driven by client activity across the regions and property and casualty insurance growth in Italy. Current account fees in Italy started to reprise reflected in new operating rates environment and are expected to negatively impact transactional fees worth about 20 million per month from April to around 2023. Client hedging fees were broadly stable as we continue to support our clients in defending their business outcome in this volatile environment.  Let's turn to Slide 27. As Andrea already took you through, costs fell 1% year-on-year. Let's take a closer look at HR and non-HR cost developments. HR costs down 2% year-on-year benefiting from lower FTE, down 4% as we keep focusing on the rationalization of non-business-related activities, while maintaining investment in key areas. The outcome of the negotiation within unions [ph] in Austria at about 8% increase for our population is considered in our full year '23 cost guidance. The trade union agreement in Italy is currently being renegotiated on a national level, while the German is valid until mid '24.  Non-HR costs are up 2% due to higher energy costs and the overall inflation impact. Net of the energy costs increase, non-HR costs are flat year-on-year. We will continue managing the impact of inflation effectively and structural cost improvements will help us keep our costs well managed beyond this year.  Let's turn to Slide 28. Cost of risk was at low 8 basis points in the quarter supported by our still low default rate at 0.8% and the good performance on repayment and back to bonus. Please remember that in Q1 '22, LLPs were almost completely related to Russia. And in Q4 '20, LLPs two overlays, we kept our overlay LLPs on performing loans stable in the quarter at around 1.8 billion to be used for any shop or to be released in the following two years.  Please remember, existing overlays are equivalent to over one year cost of risk of our only creditor log guidance. In Italy, the cost of risk of 29 basis points reflects ongoing sound asset quality and is mainly driven by provisioning on NPs. Cost of risk for Germany is low at 10 basis points and were the reduction in LPs. In Central Europe and Eastern Europe, we had negative cost of risk as a result of NP repayments leading to LLP releases.  Our updated spillover analysis confirmed the soundness of our group risk profile, which you can find in the annex. Also, in the annex, there are incremental details on our exposure to commercial real estate. The group commercial real estate portfolio towards clients operating in the construction real estate sectors is at 37 billion, with sound LTV of about 50%. Regardless of the industry in which the counterparty operates in, commercial real estate exposure financing and our corporate loans collateralized by commercial real estate is 60 billion.  In some Central and Eastern Europe countries, there is greater tendency to get real estate collateral on short-term working capital lines and other products amounting to about 8 billion which is included in increasing the commercial real estate exposure. Our exposure to commercial real estate versus total loan is in line or below market in Italy, Germany and Austria. The portfolio has been stable over recent years with declining gross NP ratio at around 4%. We have a high portion of fixed rate component and limited refinancing risk, thanks to our maturity profile and large portion amortizing repayments versus bullet. The portfolio is high quality and diversified by region and type of property. The group's expected loss on new business at 26 basis points also confirms the credit quality of our portfolio origination and how this discipline is ingrained in our organization. We continue to be vigilant to our underwriting standards, which were already reviewed and refined and post the war breakout, reflecting the uncertain macro outlook.  Let's turn to Slide 29. Our underlying asset quality remains robust, gross NPEs at 12.6 billion reduced by over 5 billion year-on-year. NPE coverage is stable at 48%. NPE coverage does not include overlays on performing loans which come on top. Our strong asset quality, high level of provisioning for NPE and overlay LLPs, we are uniquely positioned to absorb macroeconomic impacts.  Let's turn to Slide 30. In Q1 '23, our risk weighted assets to date to 299 billion, down 10 billion quarter-on-quarter driven by continued active portfolio management measure worth 2 billion. We will focus on reducing low performing businesses and 5 billion of business dynamics, which includes about 3 billion lower market risks and the effect of lower loan levels. There were no meaningful regulatory impacts in the quarter and are not expected through end of 2024. Risk weighted assets are down 31 billion year-on-year and are expected to stay below 300 billion also by year end.  Let's turn to Slide 31. Andrea has highlighted our strong CET1 ratio at the end of the quarter at 16.05%, including the accrual of 0.7 billion cash dividend. In Q1 '23, we organically generated 111 basis point of capital, 67 basis points from the profit and 44 basis points for our proactive risk weighted asset management. We're at our plan. We have started to execute to the 2.34 billion first tranche buyback for 2022. As of 28th of April, UniCredit purchased shares equal to 2.6% of the share capital for a total consideration of some 940 million. We expect to commence the second share buyback tranche of circa 1 billion shortly after the completion of the first tranche. This is highly accretive for both DPS and EPS.  Let me please finish my part by highlighting some specific items for Q2 '23. As indicated by Andrea before, we expect about 300 million integration costs for 2023, a material part of which is envisioned to be booked in Q2 '23. At the end of April, the Hungarian government changed the methodology for the calculation of the 2020 free extra profit tax, which is expected to lead to about mid 20 million higher tax for this year, which will be accounted for Q2 '23.  And I will now hand back to Andrea. Please, Andrea, the floor is yours."

        "text": "Thank you, Stefano. I will now finish with some closing remarks. Turning to our group guidance for the full year and beyond. Given improved macro, accelerated progress on our industrial transformation and the effectiveness of our lines of defense, we meaningfully improved our guidance. As regard 2023, we now expect net revenue to exceed 20.3 billion, up from over 18.5 5 billion.  There is no change to our guidance on broadly flat fees on a rebased basis. They will be down slightly year-over-year due to a rising cost of securitization to support RWA efficiency and a one-off impact of the removal of current account fees in Italy, which is effectively compensated by a higher NII as we have already discussed.  I would like to bring again to your attention our expectation for cost of risk, between 30 and 35 basis points structurally lower than the past and with potential significant tailwinds that could drive it even lower. We expect our cost base to be less than 9.6 billion, down from less than 9.7 billion despite high inflation and continued investments, evidence of the ongoing benefit of our transformation.  We expect systemic charges of around 1 billion and restructuring charges of around 300 million to continue improving our efficiency in the foreseeable future. We expect stated net profit to be over 6.5 billion. We're referring to stated net profit to align with broader industry practice and for comparison purpose versus peers. It does exclude around 400 million in AT1 and cashes coupon, while it does include 300 million of restructuring charges that we expect to take mostly in the second quarter that will benefit us in the future.  The guidance does not include the potential positive impact from DTA write up. Our organic capital generation should be circa 250 basis points this year, up 100 basis points on previous guidance, supporting a 2023 distribution of at least 575 billion, an increase from our prior ambition of around 5.25 billion. Finally, we expect our return on tangible equity of 13% CET1 of circa 15%, an increase from 12.3% in 2022.  For 2024, we currently aim for net profit and distribution to remain broadly in line with 2023 guidance. This is based on a Euribor of 3% and an average pass-through at 42.5% with an exit rate of around 45%. We also assume there is a meaningful decrease in systemic charges by several \u20ac100 million.  Let's turn to Slide 34. Our unique investment case derives from the fact that the benefit from the current macro environment is amplified by our continued transformation and lines of defense, while they also further protect us from any reversal. As such, our current gross revenue, cost and capital numbers further benefit from our alpha generation while our gross operating profit is protected by our structurally improved cost of risk and the future release of overlays.  Finally, our outsize while sustainable distribution are supported not only by the continued improvement in profitability through the levers we have just described, but also are protected by our substantial excess capital that shall be deployed to underpin it when necessary. As such, the downside risk to both our profitability and distribution is significantly lowered by the levers I have just explained.  Let's turn to the last slide. We are crystallizing the net value from the macro environment particularly as it regards to the positive effect of rates, net of inflation and cost of risk. However, we also continue to be relentlessly focused on generating alpha, using phase two of UniCredit Unlocked to further propel current results. We aim to offset as much as possible of the expected reversal of the positive macro effect in the second half of 2024 and beyond to the benefit of our business and all our stakeholders.  As a management team, we see our job to be constantly and sustainably producing alpha and looking forward to the medium and long term to protect the bank from possible headwinds while benefiting to the fullest from possible opportunities. As such, we have accelerated and are now going further than UniCredit Unlocked with a further positive impact on fees, cost, capital efficiency and cost of risk.  We aim to ensure that the positive beta that is benefiting us today is replaced in as much as possible by additional alpha once it is reversed in the future. What we have shared today as we did with each one of the last eight quarters is evidence of what can be achieved with a common ambition, the right strategy and a distinctive culture and mindset positively obsessed with creating alpha sustainably.  Thank you. And I will now open for questions."

        "text": "Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I've got two, if I may. The first one is on NII. You seem to be building deceleration basically into the rest of the year from the Q1 level. And considering calendar effects, et cetera, you would probably be expecting a little bit of a more stable revenue increase basically through the year. So I understand actually you have a quarter of your NII in CE. These days where probably rate expectations are a little more subdued into the next 12, 18 months, but if you can elaborate a little bit actually what is driving the slowdown through the year? And then the second one is on the cost side. Recurring question for me in the last two to three quarters, Stefano has alluded to that actually in the presentation, but just trying to understand if there is some degree of kind of hockey stick basically on the cost number beyond 2023, given those ongoing negotiations in Italy and the fact that you probably need to renegotiate trade union agreements again in Germany, mid '24 it was mentioned? Thank you."

      {
        "speaker": "Stefano Porro",
        "text": "So, Ignacio, in relation to net interest income, so as explained before, let's differentiate. So first, which is the level of pass through that we have, as alluded before in '22, is differentiated by country. So let's say is around 10% in Italy. To give the flavor in Germany is a little bit more than 30%. And in Central Europe is around 35%. So that is differentiated. The dynamic of the NII will be dependent on, one, the increased level of rates to the dynamic of the pass through. We are expecting, let's say, a good dynamic in Q2 as well. We might arrive to a peak, let's say, midyear clearly depending from the dynamic of the elements selected before, especially the pass through. In relation, you mentioned Central/Eastern Europe. In relation to Central/Eastern Europe, it is important to take into consideration also the dynamic of the average spread on the new lending, because the average spread on the new lending is positive, especially in Central Europe. So the front book pricing is better than the back book, by the way, not only in Central Europe, also in Eastern Europe. So this is also positively contributing to the dynamic of the net interest income. I leave the floor to Andrea for the cost."

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "So on cost, no, you should not expect a hockey stick. So as we said already last quarter, while we face continued inflation and accelerate at high levels, and while we are not relenting on the investment that we believe we need to continue doing on the frontline and in technology, it is our job to offset as much of the inflation as possible. And I remind you that while we're guiding for below 9.6 billion at the moment, UniCredit Unlocked used to aim for 9.4 billion exit rate in 2024. And while I cannot tell you that we will be there, I can tell you that the management team ambition is to get as close to that number as possible. So our job is to continue to work on simplification, rationalization, streamlining, and bringing two common denominator of a scale of a group in the renegotiation of external contract and a number of our initiatives that are not very flamboyant, but are very effective to offset the inflation or repression on our cost base. And we think that getting excellence in operational efficiency is absolutely critical to maintain our performance and to protect '24 and '25 from the reverse winning rates."

        "text": "Yes. Hi, there. Thanks for taking my questions. On your cost of risk guidance, when you talk about the upside to 30 to 35 basis points, are there any specific regions that you have in mind? Clearly, CE and EE did a bit better or does it -- could it also include potential releases of overlay? So is it underlying or overlay? And if it's underlying, where? And then on the RWA development, can you give a little bit more color on the market and credit risk as well as the ongoing action that you've undertaken? What measures were included in this quarter? And what do you still expect in terms of proactive measures for the rest of the year? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Thank you, Britta. Let me start. So cost of risk. The first comment I would make is, if you look at our cost of risk across '22 and you extract Russia and overlays, we have been at single digits for now four quarters, actually five now. Okay. So the cost of risk at the moment is and remains very benign, and is very benign for us because we have a discipline origination and discipline cost of risk on new business that is offset by significant write backs, given our conservative provisioning and staging that we continue to have. If you do a simple average and you look at a cost of risk of 8 basis points in Q1 and you exclude the additional overlays and/or other things that I do not anticipate, you will find that it is very difficult for us to exceed 30 to 35, as we do an average for the rest of the year. Now this is just math. I don't know how the business will take that. But for the time being, this is the numbers. With respect to overlays, so at the moment, if I were to tell you where we see April, we see April exactly as we saw January, February, March in cost of risk. So we continue to have a benign environment. We continue to have write backs. We continue to see a benign environment. Will this change? It will absolutely change. But at the moment, it depends on when it will change and the significance of a change. As time progresses, obviously, the cost of risk of a year becomes more and more benign because the average moves in that direction. If the shock or when the shock arrives or when the worsening of cost of risk arrives, we have 1.8 billion to release to keep the cost of risk at our guidance or below our guidance. As we said in previous call, we cannot just keep the overlays going. We need to release them. So either we release them to absorb a shock and reduce any upward movement or eliminate any upward movement or release them because there is no reason to keep them, and therefore we will take the cost of risk down. So I think what we need to think in terms of cost of risk is that we are structurally lower than the past. At the moment, it is a benign environment where we benefit from write backs given our conservative provisioning. Going forward, there will be an increase. That increase will be offset by overlays. And if the increase is less than we anticipate, the cost of risk will be further reduced by overlays. With respect to RWAs, I would say the following. What we're doing on RWAs is progressive, methodical and recurrent. So the way we originate new business is very discipline, very focused and we need to originate business very simplified EVA positive. That means slower gross, but it means that all that we book flows to a profitable bottom line. If it flows to a profitable bottom line by definition, our net income generates or more than offsets the RWAs that are used to generate it. That is continuing and improving as the discipline flows through the entire system. Boosting that, we have our legacy book. Our legacy book, while very disciplined from a risk standpoint, was not very discipline from a capital allocation standpoint. As that book rolls or is reviewed or is renegotiated, we apply the same metrics. We are applying on new business to the back book. That is boosting the RWA reduction and is boosting our organic capital generation. We said at the beginning of UniCredit Unlocked not knowing well what UniCredit was capable of but we would generate 150 basis points per annum of organic capital generation that underpinned in excess of 60 billion of capital distribution. We have made 200 basis points in '21, almost 280 basis points in '22. And while we felt that it was difficult to keep the momentum, we are now confident we can do 250 basis points this year, and in excess of 150 going forward. That brings us to an organic capital generation that allows us to underpin prudently for our distribution while building capital. So that's the macro, but maybe Stefano wants to add a few points."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Stefano Porro",
        "text": "Yes. So on the cost of risk, Andrea already commented, maybe some data points. So the full data [ph] was mentioning 0.8 in the quarter for the group. So to give a sense is 0.3 in Germany, 0.5 in Central Europe, let's say around 1% in Italy. As alluded by Andrea, the dynamic in April is fundamentally in line with Q1. Important to consider that on the expected loss side, the new production in Italy is done at 36 basis points that is a lower expected loss than the stock and please remember 1.1 billion out of 1.8 billion of overlays are in Italy. With regards to risk weighted asset, 2 billion down in the quarter is active portfolio management action, primarily focused on EVA negative clients. So our specific initiative either not rollover, getting guarantee on repricing on active portfolio management client, vast majority of that 2 billion of credit risk is fundamentally loan dynamic that we are recommending before, better mix of the credit portfolio and a little bit of reduction of temporary different EVAs. Free below market risk is fundamentally reduction of the exposure and around 1 billion [indiscernible] from the FX hedge of the structural FX risk."

You're talking about, again, improving the fee base going forward. You've mentioned the product factory delivering scale and scope. So just wondering, is there any further update or details on the product factory you are prioritizing? And is there anything on your appetite to potentially bring more factories in-house going forward? The second question was just a quick follow up. Just mechanically on the overlay provisions, just based on what you've said so far, all else equal, the macro, et cetera, plays out, as you expect. Do you expect to effectively be forced by the regulator or the auditor to release those provisions this year or is that something that could sort of flow into 2024 instead? Thank you."

      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Thank you, Benjie. So industrial transformation and factories. So we continue to execute on the build-up of factories. So the plan is simple. What we want to have is world class factory, so to the level of quality that global banks have, but deliver for our client base, which usually is reached only by our more regional competitors. The combination of this two creates a competitive advantage, providing our clients with access to products and solutions that they would not otherwise have access to either because the regional competitor cannot scale the factory or because the global bank cannot reach them. We have been building that up either organically or through partnership and we continue on that trajectory. So you could say that advisory and capital market is an organic build. And to be very clear, we do not -- we are not planning to become a global investment bank. What we're planning to do is to offer our SMEs advisory and capital markets services that of the quality that they would not otherwise be able to benefit from. Client risk management, same thing on hedging of risk of FX, rates and commodities and that can continue. On the retail side, we are doing the same thing in asset management. So we went from maybe simplistically, but to make the point, a simple pass through between our providers in asset management and the client to creating more of a brain in asset allocation, in selection, in design of products to distribute through our network and therefore adding further value. That was phase one. Phase two has moved on identifying the part of the value chain. So the asset classes that we can produce internally while maintaining the quality of the product, that is the sense of onemarkets. That is the sense of Nova. That is the sense of [indiscernible]. It's that. And we are continuing, plotting around and going forward on the same direction. You take insurance, we have identified a partner. It's the best partner we can have. And we're integrating technologically. We are expecting the release of further product in protection from them. We are -- because of a partnership, offer training, we are offered a number of other benefits. And that is going through our network with an increased growth of protection that is growing at almost 20% year-on-year in spite of a reduction on CPI. And if I continue, I will repeat exactly the same thing for every partnership, meaning it's always a reinforcement of our capability, either internally, organically, or through partnership, but through partnership where we have a two-way relationship with our partner, and not a relationship of provider/distributor. And this continues, and I don't think we're done, I think we have a couple of years more to continue at least. With respect to overlays, I would say the following. That has nothing to do with regulator. It has to do with accounting. We have taken overlays which are done above and beyond the conservative provisioning that we have on the portfolio. So while we look at the environment and we see an environment that is relatively benign, we are worried that it may degenerate and degenerate very quickly. For that reason, we have created overlays. And we identify very clearly what those overlays are linked to; energy costs, other things, there is a whole bunch of things that we identify. Within a reasonable period of time, which I would say is this year and next, either those events occur and therefore we are releasing overlays. And therefore, the increased cost of risk is reduced by the release of overlays, keeping our risk under control, or our cost of risk under control, or those events do not occur. And I'm still obliged to release them because there is no more any reason to keep them. What I think may have been missed is that this is not a new thing. If you look at 2020, '21, '22, we have released overlays every year. The point has been that because of the volatility and because of the uncertainty and because of the emerging of new risk, we have released them and rebuilt them. And therefore, you net-net saw no change in '21 and an increase in '22. But we have released the legacy overlays we had that we had built in 2020. This time, we don't think -- we don't expect new unexpected shock beyond the one we have in the overlays, so we don't expect that we will need to rebuild. And that's why we're going to flow through the P&L over the next two years."

So the shareholder remuneration policy, as of now, we're keeping it unchanged, meaning 35% of net income is going to cash dividend, and the rest is going to share buybacks, as of now. I think we look at the value we generate with our share buyback. And therefore, depending where we go, we may change that percentage in favor of cash. Secondly, what I would say is, we realize that an increasing number of our investors expects a gently upward increasing of our cash dividends per share. And therefore, we look at the dividend yield. And we take all of these things in consideration to potentially make changes. We do recognize that once we change a percentage upward 35, 40 or whatever, it stays there as a minimum floor. You remember that when we had the shock from the invasion of Ukraine, we suspended the share buyback for prudency reason. We didn't touch the dividend. And we actually said that we would calculate the dividend on net income, excluding the shock for Russia. So we understand that the cash portion needs to be defended as much as we can reasonably. With respect to the probability of the government introduction of a banking tax in Italy, I think your guest is better than mine. I just know that it is unlikely to be part of the current introduction and that the discussion has been postponed. I don't think the probabilities are 100%.

So I would call it the dynamic of our deployment of capital is driven solely by our focus on EVA positive deployment of capital. In Italy, you see a greater impact, because we feel that lending in certain segment, take mortgages as one, take large corporates as another is not recognizing the risk reward. And therefore, the profitability of a segment is not to the level that we think covers the cost of equity. I'm generalizing, it is not true everywhere. But as a result of that, we are showing a declining market share in mortgages and a declining market share in the corporate sector. And given that those two segments are large, a mortgage is larger than a consumer loan and a large corporate loan is larger than a small corporate loan, you're seeing a compression. We think that that dynamic is about to find a floor, because obviously as we have reassessed, we will not continue to lose forever, i.e. we're finding a place where we're happy with the client base and with the portfolio that we have, and the decline will stop. At that point, the gross in other segments like consumer lending or SMEs will be more visible. Now I'll pass it to Stefano."

You have also a question in relation to pricing that was partially mentioned before, so when we're looking to the pricing of the new production, so for example new near and long term [ph] production, declined rate on the front book is definitely higher than the back book. So what is expiring was either repaid. But also when you are looking to the client spread, so taking also into consideration let's say the funding costs, we are currently repricing, so around 20 basis points more, especially in Germany and in Central Europe, less so in Italy. So still when you're looking into the client spread in Italy, the new production is few basis points lower than the spread of the back book. But within that, the situation will normalize in Italy over time. With regards to systemic charges and the potential, let's say, implication in relation to the charges of single regional fund and deposit guarantee scheme. Before Andrea was highlighting the expectation for '24, the expectation for '24 is a reduction in relation to the single resolution fund component. Already this year, there was a reduction for next year. We are expecting a reduction of few 100 million. Considering the overall liquidity situation and liquidity framework of European banks, currently we are not expecting any change in relation for this approach. While for the deposit guarantee scheme standpoint, we are currently exploiting, let's say, a slight dynamic of the charges in '24 versus '23."

        "text": "Good morning, everyone. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions for me please, the first one on capital and the second one on mitigating book NII. Starting with the first one, you've generated 100 basis points of organic capital this quarter, which is impressive. Your guiding for risk weighted assets to drop below 300 billion by year end. And of course, we know you gave guidance and distribution on earnings. So your capital is going to continue to move further away from the 12.5%, 13% target range you had. And admittedly, it's a lot more capital than you can consider distributed. So I wonder where does your strategic priorities stand here aside of distribution which is very clear? That's my first question. The second one, there\u2019s a lot of focus on banks hedging strategies. If you have a replicating book of 170 billion of roughly [indiscernible] with a relatively low back book yield, is there any of the investment contribution in your full year NII guidance? Or are you just focusing mostly on the commercial side? Can you share any more details on the contribution? What the back book yield looks like? And what could be the potential benefits going forward? Thank you."

        "text": "So I'll start with capital. So at the moment, we are clearly much more organic capital generative than we had expected. This allows us both to be a positive outlier in terms of our distribution and, and I underline the and, continue to increase capital. So not only we're not using our capital access to underpin our distribution, but we're also continuing to increase capital. Why are we doing that? And what is the plan? Well, number one, we're doing that because we're already an outlier in distribution and was just a point, but until it's fully appreciated, continuing to go further and further does not seem to have a lot of impact. The second thing is that we are in an uncertain environment. There is a lot of volatility. And while we see a positive base case, I continue to say that the only certain thing is uncertainty and we don't want to be found on the back foot. The third reason, and probably the most important one, is that for as long as our organic capital generation allows us to beat the sector on distributions, that's great. But we want a, let's say, recurrent sustainable level of distributions. And as I have said before, our excess capital can play a role anytime we get a shock or if our organic capital generation starts going down, which we do not anticipate this year and next, to underpin regeneration and keep the distribution at least at the same level that we have this year for the foreseeable future. So what we offer investors is for organic capital generation underpinned and through a gradual release of our excess capital, if and when it is necessary, a foreseeable future, lesser risk level of distribution at the level that we have today or higher. That's why we took floors. Not forever, but certainly for the foreseeable future. There is no other big plan about it. It is what it is at the moment. And that's where we take it. I will pass the replicating to --"

        "text": "So replicating portfolio, you're right. We have around 170 billion. The duration is around five years. Let's say that every year, we have a rollover of around 10%. And so every year, the front book rate that we can get is definitely higher than the back book. This is included in the guidance of over 12.6 billion in 2023. And that's the reason why I was also commenting before that even in case of short-term rates cut, for example, next year, we will have, however, a contribution of few hundred million of euro from the replicating version in '24."

        "text": "Good morning. And thank you for your very detailed presentation. My first question is a more strategic field. I would say [indiscernible] proved more resilient than what you expected in the last couple of years, even the three major macro shocks that we had; so the comp [ph], the war and the energy inflation. And you likely saw -- already two years ago, you were [indiscernible] role with integral. I was wondering whether you think that medium term, it makes sense to allocate even more capital to the market also like significant sensitivity to rising rates, we have seen that Italy is one of the [indiscernible] describing accelerating the most and the deposit costs are more stable, either organically or via external growth? That's my first question. And my second question, if you can clarify sort of the evolution of the customer deposits in Q1, if I'm not mistaken at the country level, they were down. You mentioned that in Germany there was a one-off, if I'm not mistaken, if you can please clarify these? And whether at group level, there was a contribution from the [indiscernible]? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Thank you, Giovanni. So allocation of capital and more resilience, so I think the way we look at it is very simple. As we now have a granular assessment of the profitability of a deployment of our capital both by macro location through regions and more granular within every country. Every time that we see that we have an opportunity to deploy profitably above our cost of equity, which has increased, we do that. So there is -- given our overall capital position, we have absolutely no restriction in deploying the capital correctly in all of our geographies. The only restrictions are discipline on risk and discipline on returns. Beyond that, we're doing exactly what you're saying. But obviously, discipline on risk, discipline on return, and we will continue this way. And we find opportunity because others are retrenching, maintaining discipline on risk, discipline on returns, we will continue to do so. So you should anticipate that we try to do that. With respect to -- and obviously, as I said before, you do not see that because some of the growth that we're doing is obscured by the optimization of improvement of efficiency of our loan portfolio, as we get out of lending position that are unprofitable. And those mask some of the growth that we're already delivering. The second part on the deposits, and then I'll pass maybe more detail to Stefano, I think it's important that we look at deposit and liquidity in two ways. So if you are considered a flight to quality bank, you can benefit to that in two ways. One, you try to attract as many deposit as you can. Two, you try to improve your profitability as much as you can. And if you think about it, what is happening in the market is that depositors are giving a greater value to banks that are better capitalized, better covered, more liquid, less risky. So as it's normal, but we haven't seen that in many, many years, depositor will say, I'll take a slightly lower deposit base rate because this bank will give me the money back, simplifying okay. So given that our loan to deposit ratio is below 90%, we have no need to hover deposits. We look at them closely, but we have no need to press on increasing the deposits. But maximizing or the improvement or the maintenance of our pass through or rather maintaining our pass through as low as possible is critical. And why is it critical? Not only for current profitability, but because we will have a rate reversal, we will have a rate reversal. That rate reversal will occur sometimes in '24. We hope the second half, it could happen earlier. At that point, the pass through that will have been considered is the pass through that will exist. So you will have lesser rates, a higher pass through margin gets crushed. Effect number one. Effect number two, the costs that have not been defended and have increased are not going to go down just because inflation goes down. They're going to stay there. Revenue down, cost up, crush. Thirdly, the cost of risk will come at the tail end of a cycle as it always does. So revenue down, cost up, cost of risk up, crush. So what we're focusing on relentlessly is to avoid that and making our profitability sustainable in '24, '25 and beyond. How are we doing that? Defend the pass through in as much as possible. So the NII crushes less, develop further the fees through the transformation of our factory, keep the cost down, and if possible, lower. So when the revenues go down, our costs are not found to be higher, and keeping all of our provision and buffers so that when cost of risk goes up, we have buffers to offset it. In this way, we should be able to maintain a much greater degree of the profitability we have found for the first time in 15 years in the foreseeable future. And all of this is connected in such fashion."

        "text": "So I'll give you some data points. So it's important to distinguish end of period versus the average. So end of period Q1 versus Q4, deposits are down 12 billion. 7 billion is Germany, 6 billion is Italy. 10 billion out of 12 billion is corporate, mainly large corporate. So as commented more than once for pricing reason and for some transaction done by these corporates. When we are looking on the other end on the average deposits, so average Q1 versus average Q4, I think it's a better metric to avoid some volatility. The deposits are down 8 billion, but in this case is 6 billion for Germany. Same reason, large corporate. And Italy is down by just 1 billion."

        "speaker": "Delphine Lee",
        "text": "Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to go back to NII and I just heard your comments. Just in terms of the outlook for '24, given that -- because data you\u2019re assuming 42.5%, and based on the sensitivity 1 percentage increasing, the probability is quite high. So it sounds like we're going to get a 1.5 billion potential headwind from the probability to increase. Just wondering on the other moving parts, do you expect anything to offset that? I know you mentioned a couple of 100 million for application portfolio, but just wondering if it is possible to maintain NII flat next year or even increasing? And then my second question is regarding capital and other big dynamics. You talked a little bit about how you\u2019re optimizing the legacy portfolio which is not capital efficient. Is it possible to get a bit of -- just a flavor of the size of that legacy book just to understand how much are there mitigation we can get in coming years? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "So, thank you, Delphine. First of all, let me be clear that the impact on our NII is an industry thing. It is not specific to UniCredit. If anything, we think we are a little bit more asymmetrical on the way down, meaning we are going to suffer a little bit less on the way down. Why do we think that? Number one, because as we're demonstrating, we're capable of managing the pass through because of our strengths and liquidity position a lot better than average. And that will help us when rates reverse. So if we are at that level of pass through, then we expect the industry to be on average higher, or we will be below that level of pass through. So that's the first thing. The second thing that underpins our NII symmetrically is the replicating portfolio, because we have replicated less in the past and we can now benefit for replicating more in the future, or rolling further in the future. And the new loans are obviously stripping at better rates. So these things will reduce the shock. The other thing that will reduce the shock is, as I said before, a lesser drag from the continued optimization of our portfolio by pulling back from segments that we think are EVA disruptive that will not continue forever. And when you stop that, the benefit from what we're doing in consumer finance and we're doing on SME loan and in other places will come much more clearly visible. In any case, our expectation at the moment is that we see NII peeking between second and third quarter. And we see, because of the conjunction of rates in Europe getting to their maximum level and pass through being higher, but not as high as the exit rate of a year. From there, it will follow a trend in our opinion where rates will be held at that level for a certain period of time, and then will decrease while pass through will start converging. The speed of those two things is very unclear and depends on the strength of the economy and on the dynamics of inflation. So we can have a scenario -- the scenario is in the presentation, but it can change. With respect to how we are offsetting, because what you're saying is correct. If all of that happens, banks will have a very significant reversal of the NII tailwinds quite soon, relatively soon, is continue to working on the factories to boost our fees. So part of the boosting fees will occur physiologically, because when rates drop, our asset management fees are going to improve. Part is due to better integration in protection, new products in protection, what we're doing in payments, et cetera, et cetera, that should be giving some tailwinds from I would say the second part of '24 onwards to our fees. The other thing that we're doing is obviously driving costs down and keeping our cost of risk as low a level and keeping buffer to protect it going into '24 and '25. So I do think that for us, the real challenge or the real ambition is not so much what we're going to generate and make in 2023. In a certain way, while we're doing well, the dies are cast. What is the challenge and the ambition is to be able to protect as much as this newfound profitability on a sustainable basis in '24 and '25. And that's what we have been doing through the transformation and the lines of defense starting the summer of last year. And we will continue to do."

        "text": "Yes, you had a question in relation to which is, let's say, the part of the portfolio that we can still focusing on for risk weighted asset efficiency measures. So let's break down into our portfolio. So if you look at our risk weighted asset and their related credit risk, around 70 billion are the retail portfolio, 180 billion is the corporate portfolio. The main focusing on the corporate portfolio, so on the 180 billion, let's say, that you have 10% of that that you can optimize is around \u20ac18 billion. It's clear that not everything done via reduction, because we can also work on that portfolio via repricing working with the clients and so on. So this is more or less a portion of that can be also securitized and so on. So in your eyes between '23 and '24, that is the portion of the portfolio that we'll be looking at."

Let's suppose just hypothetically, you have a cash acquisition, you're buying earnings, you're buying a certain capital position, you're buying a certain liquidity, you're buying that and you're integrating the group with the same share count. Alternatively, you have the same earnings of UniCredit with a lower share count. At that point, which one is your better investment? That's as simple as that. If you cut off all the strategy of a noisy [ph] industrial, which one is the better investment? I would argue, but if you look at the progression of our results, which we obviously believe in, buying our shares has been the better investment, heads on shoulders [ph] and continues to be. If that were to change adjusted for execution risk, et cetera, we may act differently. As far as the regulators are concerned, I will not answer, but the significance of our distribution is looked at considering both our profitability, our organic capital generation, our starting and ending level of CET1, and they're all in our favors. And I guess any M&A that hypothetically we were to look at will be looked at on the impact on the bank, and its risk and capital base. I don't think we're looking at it in any different way from them, but I don't want to answer for them."

Ma'am, you may begin.\nMagda Palczynska: Good morning and welcome to UniCredit\u2019s second quarter 2023 results conference call. Andrea Orcel, our CEO, will lead the call. Then, Stefano Porro, our CFO, will take you through the financials in more detail. Following Andrea\u2019s closing remarks there will be a Q&A session. Please limit yourself to two questions. With that, I will hand over to Andrea.\nAndrea Orcel: Thank you, Magda and thank you all for joining today. I'd like to start the call with a heartfelt thank you for all the employees of UniCredit that continued to deliver as we have quarter-after-quarter. Thank you, all.\nrecurring: Liquidity has remained stable, pass-through and cost of risk more benign and profitability at elevated levels. We continue to push into the future, the expected shocks within this environment UniCredit's excellent results are a demonstration of a resilience of not only Europe, but of the European banks. Yes, risk remains and inflation combined with a possible further economic slowdown and the development of new technology needs to be managed. So we remain vigilant. We take pre-emptive actions, prudent and ready to adapt. But what this presentation will demonstrate is the excellent progression of UniCredit unlocked and of our industrial and cultural transformation, but our people are leading the evolution and doing so as one team united by the same principle, the same values and with the same mission.  The vision driving that mission is for UniCredit to be the bank for Europe's future and a new benchmark for banking. Let's start our presentation with slide two, I guess. Is it working? 1 second. Okay, let me start with a snapshot of our current results. This show just how well we are progressing towards realizing that vision. We have delivered our 10th consecutive quarter of profitable growth, the best second quarter and first half ever. Underlying net profit in the first half of the year was \u20ac4.5 billion or in excess of that. This is adjusted for \u20ac230 million of integration cost that we are expensing to continue supporting our operational efficiency improvements in the face of inflation whilst becoming more agile and self-funding significant investments. Net revenue rose 38% year-over-year. This is especially impactful. Sorry, we seem to be having a problem with slide, one second. Here we go. Sorry. Yeah. Let's see if they stay. Yes. Okay. So net revenue rose 38% year on year. This is especially impactful given the drag from targeting quality growth, one that shows risk, discipline, improvement of mix and a focus on EVA positive transaction. Costs fell 1% and RWA 7% year-on-year in spite of gross, inflation and our investment for the future. The effectiveness of our operational and capital levers is shown in our 39% cost income ratio and our 8% net revenue on RWA ratio. Both are best ever, industry-leading and a result of improvement on both variable of the ratio, so both numerator and denominator. So far this year, our return on tangible equity at 13% CET1 is at 21%. It is still at 17%, considering the excess capital that we still carry. Our CET1 reached 16.6%, structurally higher than our target of 12.5% to 13%, whilst at the same time we will have distributed in excess of \u20ac15.5 billion between 2021 and 2023, well above our initial target. This is thanks to our much higher than initially expected profitability and organic capital generation. Indeed, we generated 210 basis points or \u20ac6.5 billion of capital in the first half alone. The strategy we're implementing is uniting our bank as one empowered franchise, capable of delivering consistent quality, profitable growth and outsized distribution over the long term. As such, we are upgrading both our net income and distribution guidance respectively, to equal or greater than \u20ac7.25 billion and \u20ac6.5 billion, while absorbing yet upsized integration cost of \u20ac500 million and continuing to increase our CET1 year-over-year, all providing a strong foundation and outlook for 2024, as we expect to be broadly in line with the increasing higher bar set this year, we've clearly identified levers to achieve it. What you're seeing with this result is the combination of a sector benefiting from generally supportive macro, some of which is structural, as we're not going back to negative rates and the large contribution from the relentless execution of UniCredit unlocked. The latter is what continues to drive our differentiation versus peers and enables us to beat expectation. Let me take you again through its essence, understanding it is understanding our transformation to date and our further potential. Let's start with our winning strategy to achieve our vision. We have a group-wide determination to put clients at the center to understand what they want today and what they will need tomorrow. We serve them across three foundational countries, boosted by ten of the fastest growing and most innovative markets in Europe coming together as one. This is a bank that represents a new and emerging Europe powered by a renewed single group mindset that truly unlocks the unique value for our clients and other stakeholders of being pan European. We provide our clients with a differentiated service that combines local reach with European interconnection and group-wide product factories that leverage an ecosystem of best in class partners, powered by an increasingly harmonized, forward-looking digital data and operations across our group. All is underpinned by solid principle and values that our people chose, live and breathe day to day.  Then we move to our ongoing industrial and cultural transformation, unique in that from within and employee led. We are strengthening our client proposition, distribution power and product factories while streamlining our organization, processes and way of working across all banks, all supported by our technology evolution. We continue to invest in the business for the long term, making the necessary structural changes to be future-proofed and resilient. This allows us to support our communities through social programs, our clients and people to go through challenging times and our commitment to use and education. This approach serves all of our stakeholders well while delivering exceptional targeted financial outcome. As we continue to strive for excellence and execute relentlessly on UniCredit Unlocked, I am confident that our financial performance is set to continue through 2023, 2024 and beyond. Let's turn to Slide four. Let me now take you through how we are deploying our strategy in further detail. Clients UniCredit Unlocked is primarily driven by around our 50 million clients across Europe, serving them and their communities locally, but benefiting from tools available to a group of our size and nature. For most of our franchise countries, experts make up 50% of GDP. So our footprint is a unique gateway to the continent and possible expansion. We have overlaid this with industrial actions designed to ensure our clients not only connect, but also have access to premium tailor-made products, access the way they prefer. This is supported by investments in our network, which we continue to upgrade and technology aiming to create the branch of a future in which an omnichannel approach combines a digital offering with passionate skilled people delivering best in class solutions, all within a higher quality and seamless client experience. Our clients are served by 13 banks who are leaders in their own market. We have refocused our previously inward looking organization towards our clients. We have reunified our client franchises, harmonized group segmentation and return coverage and day-to-day decision to our banks and within our banks to the frontline. This model relies on both a clear unified framework of reference and our diverse talent who have the best understanding of the local market and dynamics. Talent which is critical for us to attract, retain and develop, which is why we hired around 2,000 people and we are providing them with circa 30 hours of training to maintain pace within digitization, product development, risk and ESG. Each market is now equally served by group product factories, which we pulled out from the individual banks and centralized. These in-house factories leverage our group-wide scale and scope, also to support an ecosystem of top class partners. The most recent example is Mastercard. We signed a ground-breaking partnership in June the first time any large commercial bank had put in place a single card exclusive multi-market strategy of this scale in Europe. This partnership underscore our one UniCredit approach and are further unifier across all of our market. The centralization of our factories and group-wide partners, combining with delayering, simplification of processes and way of working, training and putting back decision capabilities in the right places are delivering the divisional result you have witnessed today and in the last 10 quarters, best-in-class, in each market, in each business. All of these pillars are being facilitated and enhanced by a gradually more streamlined and group-wide approach to technology and operation. The first phase of our digital evolution is nearing completion, taking back control of our heavily fragmented and outsourced technology, bringing it in house and selectively investing in it. We have hired more than 700 developers since 2022 and are upscaling our people to ensure that we have the right capabilities engaging our providers from a group standpoint, instead of individually and streamlining the way of working to lower cost and most importantly, time to market. We have invested in cleaning and simplifying products and processes, freeing up resources, time and investment dollars, which can be repositioned towards what we really need. The second phase will be the gradual transformation to a modern, digital and data-driven organization, which will see the acceleration of automation, design of new tools and best-in-class platforms to improve our client responsiveness and more efficiency in the increasing of our consumption of technology. All of this is united by a holistic culture driven by core values and a common set of principle chosen by our people and embodied in our actions. Our industrial and cultural transformation has powered our last 10 quarters, delivered differentiated performance, and rebased our key financial metrics. We now have a sustainable competitive advantage that we are determined to further consolidate. Let me take you through our new transform core financial KPIs and their drivers. We believe we have cost leadership. This is critical to maintain a differentiated level of profitability, particularly given recent and prospective inflationary pressures. It is also critical to maintain our edge over fintechs and other market players. We have moved from force to efficiency leadership in Q1. This is a structural change versus the past and is driven by targeted cost reduction that does not affect, but rather invests and propels the quality of our revenue growth. In absolute terms, we have reduced our cost base since 2017 by 18%. Critically, however, since 2021 this was done while substantially propelling and increasing both gross and net revenue, rather than shrinking them. We aim to continue and even strengthen this competitive advantage. Quality revenue growth, we transformed both the growth and quality of our earnings. We moved from revenue laggard to revenue leader, delivering 10 successive quarters of top tier quality growth. We fundamentally transformed our ability to grow our revenue base, while improving our mix. Targeted quality revenue growth has meant being disciplined on risk, delivering EVA positive new business and focusing on fees and other capital light EVA positive sources. Net revenue to RWA improved from 10th to third, whilst fees to RWAs improved from fifth to second as we're strengthening our factories. We have and will continue to address weaknesses generated by past retrenchment, but so are selling or constraining quality businesses. We have made significant progress in rebuilding our high value added client content in a number of ways. Firstly, organically by hiring best-in-class talent attracted by our ability to deliver 15 million clients across Europe in a captive fashion. This is the case in both advisory and capital market and client risk management, demonstrated by the caliber of talent NineHouse and the visible results. These are targeted to our existing client base. Secondly, by selectively internalizing critical part of the value chain, for example in asset management building central product selection and packaging, able to deliver projects such as Nova and One Markets. Thirdly, through our two way partnership with best-in-class product provider such as Allianz, Azimut and more recently, Mastercard. Finally, we are reviewing further opportunities of growth, for example in payments both corporate and retail, where we see a significant opportunity and in unit linked, where we could internalize our dominant business in Italy. All of this requires significant investment in talent, in training, in technology, to both power group-wide factories and local distribution channels and deliver seamless integration between them. Let me give you an example to explain that point. Let's take insurance. We have already rationalized our providers from nine to four and transformed them into partners. Today Allianz designs best in class protection products tailored for our clients. Together, we have trained our people and provided insights to our clients. The result is a step up in our Italian protection market share to 14%. We're taking it even further. An integrated tech platform at group level is being launched, allowing real time access to product with streamlined processes and technology solution. This will further power our growth in the segment. Our transform quality revenue capacity is another competitive advantage that we will continue to focus on. Structural lower cost of risk; over the past few years, our gross net NPs have fallen dramatically respectively to 2.6% and 1.4%. Our underlying cost of risk has structurally declined from at least 40 basis points to 50 basis points to 20 basis points to 25 basis points, so subject to confirmation within a longer time series. Indeed, our underlying cost of risk, excluding Russia and overlays between 21 and in 2023 year to date, has been well below 20 basis points, reaching single digit basis points over each one of the last six quarters. It has benefited from a particularly benign environment and write-backs from repayments, which underscore how conservative we are on staging, classification and provisioning generally. This is due to the substantially higher quality of our credit portfolio as compared to the past that we have markedly accelerated since 2020. Second, the substantial more conservative absolute and relative to peers both backward and forward looking staging and provisioning policy, we are covered much higher in every NPE stage. We believe we have moved firmly at the forefront of our peer group in this matter and are better prepared than any to weather the current macro and geopolitical uncertainty. As a result, cost and cost of risk are much more within our control now in the next few years than most of the market had realized. We are prepared with this healthy provision and overlays in a quality credit portfolio to provide a solid buffer and positively differentiate cost of risk, both for now and in case the market turns. This is another competitive advantage and we are determined to continue strengthening it. Capital excellence, our transform capital efficiency has been a major contributor to our sustainable performance and we ranked first on this measure relative to peers in Q1. This has three main drivers. First, we focus on deploying, sorry, slide. We focus on deploying capital above the cost of equity. 77% of corporate RWAs are now to SCBA positive clients as we improve the profitability of our legacy portfolio and our discipline in new business. Second, we improve the profitability of our commitments via crosssell and pricing or ultimately exiting or securitizing position where accretive. Third, we are growing capital-light products. This is yet another competitive advantage that supports our return on tangible equity and organic capital generation. We are determined to continue building upon it. Our P&L advantages combine with those of our balance sheet, creating performance with strengths. Our CET1 remains best-in-class among peers. We continue to grow capital in spite of our best-in-class distribution, thanks to our outsized organic capital generation. Our liquidity ratio remains strong, sustainable and well above peer average, allowing better management of margins. We maintain a high quality credit portfolio with conservative proactive staging and provisioning, further improved by high overlays and lower default rate. We are focused on investing wisely to maintain profitable risk-adjusted return for the long term to the benefit of all our stakeholder and in many forms. These last two slides have sought to explain what a dramatically different group UniCredit is today, despite being less than two years into our strategic plan. Our commitment to continuing this fundamental and holistic transformation remains, as does our commitment to delivering strong, sustainable result and distribution. It is our knowledge of how much more this transformation can unlock that gives us confidence in the future beyond the effect of this positive macro. Let's now get back to the present. This is our tenth consecutive quarter of quality profitable growth. We have balanced our three levers to deliver this in a sustainable fashion. Net revenues rose significantly in both the half and the quarter, driven by quality NII growth and a tightly managed pass through. Fees remain robust, especially if we exclude the impact of lower current account fees in Italy that had not yet been waived by all banks. This is \u20ac20 million adverse per month and cost of risk at very levels, both given macro and the new change UniCredit I have just described. Of particular note is the dynamic of our deposit pass through below expectation at circa 24% and showing signs of approaching more normalized levels outside of Italy. This supports our new pass through guidance. We have been able to more than compensate the inflationary pressure on cost, both in the half and in the quarter while continuing to invest. Integration cost enable us to continue on this path, and we're stepping them up. The positive momentum in our gross operating profit continues again beating expectation. It rose close to 52% in Q2 and 42% in H1. Our capital excellence continue with both outsized capital generation and further consolidation of best-in-class CET1. UniCredit return on tangible equity continues to rise and we are surpassing our peers on this metric, having significantly lagged until a few years ago. At the same time, thanks to our substantial share buyback at depressed valuation, we are further propelling a very significant per share value creation. We are fairly unique in this respect. Let me take you now through each country or region. Our Italian business had yet another excellent quarter, demonstrating its ability to deliver sustained quality, profitable growth and outstanding returns well above peers. Net revenue rose 19% year-over-year to \u20ac5.2 billion, gross revenue up '23. This was driven by NII growth of 66%. Thanks to strict management of the pass through. Fees were down 5.2% year-on-year, mostly due to active relief provided to customer on current account applied since April. Without such relief, our fees would have been down only 2.6%. We saw good result in asset under custody, products and excellent ones in protection as was commenting. Costs fell 2% in Italy, thanks to our continued focus on simplification and streamlining and despite continuing investment both in the front line with Circa 370 new hires in 2023 and in our branches with Circa 550 completely renewed branches from the beginning of 2022. RWAs were reduced by 12%. As a result, we achieved a strong operating and capital efficiency with a 35.5% cost income ratio and 9.1% net revenue to RWAs. Profit before tax rose 31% to \u20ac2.9 billion, RoAC exceeded 25% and the region contributed 86 basis points, or \u20ac2.7 billion of organic capital generation to the group.  Our commitment to our community, clients and employees remain undiminished this quarter, delivering amongst other things, the launch of a second tranche of UniCredit per l'Italia a \u20ac10 billion package to support clients, both individuals and business. We also introduced a package of up to \u20ac1 billion to support those impacted by the May floods and offered mortgages dedicated to energy sustainability to help family and individuals in the realization of their housing projects. Today's strong set of result and the very concrete step we have taken to support families and businesses confirm that financial and social objectives are not in conflict, demonstrating that UniCredit can deliver for the benefit of our investors and of Italy as a whole. Germany; Germany's structural transformation continued to power excellent result. Net revenues were up 13% year-over-year. Gross revenues were up 14%. This was driven by NII up 9% and fees up 5% driven in part by the successful delivery of our capital-light corporate financial advisory business and also asset management fees. Cost fell nearly 5.3% in Germany with the ongoing transformation more than compensating for inflation and setting a new run rate for the future. RWAs were down 5% year-over-year. We also achieved a very strong operating and capital efficiency in Germany with a 41.7% cost income ratio and 7.3% net revenue on RWA ratio. Profit before tax was up 36% at \u20ac1.3 billion. RoAC reached 18.7% and the region delivered 57 business points or \u20ac1.8 billion of organic capital to the group. We continue to invest in our clients and our frontline delivering the introduction of a cashless advisory branch model for local high quality customer advice. Our corporate client portal has released further functionalities including the introduction of power of attorney self-service. This quarter has seen Germany continue to deliver simplification with integration of COO and Digital to deliver a full end-to-end and customer-focused approach. All of this is resulting in US being named top employer in Germany for the 13th time in a row and receiving the EDGE Move certification for D&I in 2022. Central Europe, Central Europe's quarter was defined by consistent stability and delivery of high profitability. Net revenues were up 29% year-over-year, gross were up 27%. This was driven by NII up 39%, fees slightly down following general market pressure but up in transaction and financing. Costs remained flat year-over-year as the discipline continue across all countries and our focus on operating and capital efficiency was reflected in a \u20ac38.5 cost income ratio and 7% net revenue on RWA ratio. Profit before tax was up 65% to \u20ac1.1 billion. RoAC was 20.6% and the region delivered, sorry, delivered 29 basis points or \u20ac0.9 billion of capital organically. We have made significant progress in retail digitalization signing up 67,000 new clients in first half, '23 in Czech Republic and Slovakia alone. We launched our first green mortgage covered bond in the Czech Republic and succeeded in obtaining the Green Start Certificate in Slovenia. We established the inaugural Girls Go Finance Event to strengthen girls' understanding of finances through our partnership with Teach For Austria, an initiative we intend to roll out across all of our Teach For All markets. Eastern Europe; Eastern Europe profitability continued at pace this quarter, driven by business intensity and further efficiency gains. Net revenues were 47% year-over-year, with gross revenue up 31%. This was powered by both NII up 44% and fees up 4%. Our focus on active cost management continued to balance a continuous efficiency drive with investment in digitalization and automation. Our focus on operating and capital efficiency was reflected in a 34.1% cost income ratio and 9.2% net revenue on RWA ratio. Profit before tax landed at \u20ac800 million. RoAC was 34.4% and the region delivered 18 basis points or \u20ac600 million of capital organically. We continue to invest in our network and business and customer transformation. This quarter, we introduced cashless branches in Bulgaria. We effectively balanced our S with our E commitments, rolling out a number of social programs for vulnerable groups focused on use in Romania, whilst also supporting the employees of this group. At the same time, we saw \u20ac170 million of new lending to renewable energy within Bulgaria. Client Solution as we have discussed extensively about our investment in our factories, we will now provide just some key highlights and additional data for this quarter. Client solution revenue was resilient in the first half and relative to a strong base. Revenue fell 3% year-on-year and would have been up 1% excluding Russia. Corporate solution revenue fell 2% in the first half but grew by 3%. Excluding Russia, overall fees were up 5% year on year with RWA consumption down 13%. Driving record profitability, transaction and payment revenue rose 12% year on year, while advisory and capital markets was up seven and reached the number one fee ranking in its home market. Client risk management revenue fell 13% but would have been flat excluding Russia. Specialized lending was down 9% year on year, but flat normalized for TLTRO and one large one off. Individual solution revenue fell 4% year-over-year. Strong performance in protection continued while life insurance remained under pressure, particularly as we kept discipline around RAMOPRIMO. Brokerage and custody showed the strongest growth up 90% led by strong client demand for bond products. Our commitment to our purpose begins with us and the actions and decision we take with respect to our own people, our clients and those communities that we are intrinsically part of. These actions were evident in the overview that I gave for each one of the regions, action targeted for the need and challenges of each local market, but beyond that, whether it is closing the gender pay, the partnership we forged to fight discrimination, supporting arts and culture, the work of our foundation, which will now invest this year alone \u20ac20 million in project to support, use and education of our UniCredit start lab, our commitment to deliver on our purpose a central tenet of our strategic plan. I am now handing over to Stefano, who will provide more detail on our numbers on H1.\nStefano Porro: Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 18. Before I take you through the second quarter '23 results, please note the my comments are based on a year-on-year comparison, that second quarter '23 versus second quarter '22, unless otherwise noted. Let's look at the P&L in more detail, starting with revenue. In the second quarter, we generated a record \u20ac6 billion revenue up 25%, mainly thanks to an increase in net interest of about \u20ac1 billion. Revenue in second quarter includes the \u20ac60 million negative impact from current account fiat pricing in Italy. Trading activity at \u20ac0.5 billion, up 32%, supported by the fixed income, currency and commodities business. This quarter also benefited from higher treasury contribution. We took \u20ac0.1 billion impairments in profit for investment in the quarter, mostly from participation in Russia, Italy and Austria. Systemic charges in second quarter include \u20ac27 million tax on extra bank profits in Hungary as the government changed the methodology for the 2023 calculation as flagged last quarter. Let's turn to the next slide. Let me share some highlights of UniCredit's strong balance sheet and robust liquidity position. Our favorable liquidity position, starts with the structure of our balance sheet and a loan-to-deposit ratio well below 100% at a stable and sound 90%. We have a resilient and diversified deposit base. More than 80% of our deposit are from retail and SME clients. Our deposit market share across the group is stable. The decrease in volumes in the quarter are mainly driven by corporate, using their cash buffer and our focus on pricing. Thanks to our superior liquidity profile and balance sheet strength, we are in a position to be able to do so. Retail deposit volumes were broadly stable. Clients kept diversifying their saving into more asset under custody products, in particular BTPs in Italy, and they are keeping their asset with us with our TFAs up \u20ac11 billion in the quarter. Total deposits are still comfortably above pre-2020 levels. We expect the overall deposit volume to continue slightly declining in 2023 as we prioritize pricing management and quality net interest income, and as there is further rotation to asset under custody or asset under management. This is also reflected in our deposit beta, which I will discuss in more detail later. Our liquidity cover ratio at second quarter '23 was above 100% the after TLTRO repayments, in line with our managerial target range at 125% to 150%. We have a large liquidity buffer with about \u20ac215 billion liquid assets effectively unchanged, compared to the quarter before. Let's turn to Slide 20 and focus again on the quarter. Net interest income was \u20ac3.5 billion, up 6% quarter-on-quarter We continue to experience a positive net interest dynamic driven by higher loan rates and still low deposit beta. Net interest margin at 2.1%, up nine basis point in the quarter. Customer loan rates are up 43 basis point in the quarter across our regions, leveraging on higher interest rates and thanks to our commercial actions. Average client loan volumes relevant for net interest are down \u20ac4.3 billion in the quarter, driven by Germany and Italy, mainly short term loans for SME and large corporate. Clients demand for lending has declined in the first half of the year and is expected to remain contained as a consequence of higher rates. We remain focused on more profitable capital efficiency loans while supporting our clients. Loan volumes are bolstered by \u20ac3.3 billion in USG lending in the quarter as we continue assisting our client screen transition and support social initiatives. The increase in the customer deposit rate is limited to 20 basis points for the quarter, while the average Euribor three months was up 73 basis points. Our average deposit pricing is below the system across most of our regions. Average commercial deposit decreased by \u20ac8.9 billion in second quarter, mainly in Germany, but also Austria, driven by a few large corporates. We expect retail deposit market share to remain stable, while corporate deposit dynamic will continue to be lumpy. We have updated our managerial interest guidance and sensitivity. Based on a 3.75% ECB deposit facility rate from the third quarter, remaining stable thereafter and a deposit beta below 40% and the end of the year, we expect an improved full year '23 net interest income guidance at least \u20ac13.2 billion. This is mainly thanks to a better average deposit beta for the year slightly below 30%. The observed deposit beta for the group for both side and term deposit in second quarter is around 24%, an increase as we expected, but less than assumed. The slight increase in the quarter is mainly driven by Austria. In Italy we still have a low level of circa 11%. We continue to see a shift from site to term deposit. However, site for the group is still 75%. The recent TLTRO maturities did not have a material impact on the market or UniCredit funding cost. The net interest income sensitivity for a one percentage point of deposit beta is about \u20ac130 million at current rates and deposit volume assumption. The net interest income impact from an ECB deposit facility rate increase of 50 basis point is about \u20ac0.3 billion, which also depends on our client behavior and competitive dynamics develop. If the ECB starts to reduce short term rates, our deposit replicating portfolio, which is factored into our net interest income guidance will continue to support our net interest income. At today's interest rate levels, the run rate net interest income will be supported by about \u20ac0.3 billion per year. Let's turn to Slide 21. Fees in second quarter were \u20ac1.9 billion, up 2% excluding the current account fee reduction in Italy were \u20ac60 million in the quarter, in line with our guidance. Continuous strong performance in transactional fees and better financing fees more than offset still subdue investment fees. We are well-diversified and balanced as you can see from the year-on-year development of the different component parts of our fees. Transactional fees were up 1% or 11% excluding current account fee reduction in Italy, thanks to robust payment and card fees driven by client activity and property and casualty insurance growth in Italy. Repriced current account fees in Italy will continue to negatively impact transactional fees by about \u20ac20 million per month to yearend 2023. Financing fees are up 2% thanks to a recovering global capital market activity and loan fees in Germany more than offsetting higher securitization cost stemming from our active portfolio management strategy and lower credit protection insurance linked to retail mortgages in Italy. Investment fees were down 3% on reduced management fees due to lower average asset under management stock, mainly in Italy. Asset under management gross sales. And upfront fees are stable. Client aging fees were stable as we keep on supporting our clients in defending their business outcome in this volatile environment.  Let's turn to Slide 22. We reduced costs 1.2% year on year, while inflation in our footprint was above 8% in first half 2023. Let's take a closer look at HR and on HR cost developments. HR costs down 1% year on year benefiting from lower FTS down 4.6% to 73,000, supported by earlier retirement plans becoming effective in Italy.  The trade union agreement in Italy is currently being renegotiated on a national level, while the German one is valid until mid-2024. Austria closed the annual agreement at the beginning of 2023, and the mandatory salary increase of about 8% is already included in second quarter '23. Results non HR costs are down 1.4% thanks to a tight cost management and remediation actions compensating the overall inflation impact. Although integration costs are not included in the cost line, we incurred \u20ac214 million in second quarter '23. We expect for the full year to have around \u20ac0.5 billion. This is to further allow us to reduce the structural long term cost base of the group while keep hiring and investing. Let's turn to Slide 23. Cost of risk was at very low two basis point in the quarter, supported by our still low default rate at 0.8% and the good performance on repayments and back to Bonnies. We kept our overlay LLPs on performing loans stable in the quarter at around \u20ac1.8 billion to be used for any shocks or to be released in the following two years.  Our underlying cost of risk net of overlays in Russia has reset and was single digits basis point over the last six quarters. The cost of risk in the quarter includes our Biannual IFRS nine macro scenario update with corresponding LLPs stable in Italy. The cost of risk of 21 basis points reflects ongoing sound asset quality. Cost of risk for Germany and Eastern Europe is low at seven and four basis points respectively. In Central Europe, we had the negative cost of risk because of MP repayments leading to LLP releases.  Our updated spillover analysis and details of our commercial erect exposure can be found in the Annex and confirm the soundness of our group risk profile. The group's expected loss on your business at 27 basis points also confirms the credit quality of our portfolio origination and our discipline is ingrained in our organization.  Let's turn to slide 24. Our underlying asset quality remain robust gross MPs at \u20ac12.1 billion, reduced by about \u20ac0.5 billion in second quarter. The MP reduction was driven by unlikely to pay portfolio disposal in Italy, which lowered the share of unlikely to pay impasse due.  Still comparable AI at 76%, MP coverage ratio at 48%. Broadly stable quarter on quarter MP coverage does not include overlays on performing loans which come on top. Let's turn to Slide 25 in second quarter, our risk weighted asset stood at \u20ac295 million, down \u20ac4 billion quarter on quarter, driven by continued active portfolio management measure worth \u20ac3.5 billion including securitization and the reduction of low performing businesses.  Risk weighted assets are down \u20ac22 billion year on year and are expected to remain below \u20ac300 billion also by year end. Let's turn to slide 26 in second quarter, we organically generated 101 basis point of capital, 77 basis point from net profit and 24 basis point through our active risk credit asset management way ahead of our plan. We completed the two point 34,000,000,001st share by back tranche and launched the remaining \u20ac1 billion second tranche for 2022. As of 21 July, UniCredit purchased shares equal to 6.5% of the share capital for a total consideration of some \u20ac2.4 billion. Before I hand back to Andrea one item of note the Hungarian extra profit tax has been extended to 2024 as well and we it to be broadly in line with this year amount which was \u20ac75 million. Please Andrea, the floor is yours.\nAndrea Orcel: Thank you, Stefano. I will now finish with some closing remarks we're now incorporating in. The improved assumption on rates and pass through as well as cost of risk. We are also further stepping up in the execution of Unicreated unlocked key industrial drivers. As such, we are upgrading again our net profit guidance for 2023 to at least \u20ac7.25 billion, an increase of around 1.6 billion from our initial guidance at the beginning of this year, despite absorbing \u20ac500 million in integration costs that were not budgeted at the beginning of the year.  Accordingly, our distribution intention for 2023 has improved to a minimum of \u20ac6.5 billion, \u20ac1.25 billion higher than our guidance at the start of the year. Ass cash dividend shall be at least \u20ac2.4 billion up 25% year-on-year versus \u20ac1.9 billion of 2022 and circa 35% up.  Based on the current number of shares, we are confident that we will maintain this profitability and distribution at broadly this level for 2024. Given our clear levers to deliver within this reference macro, sorry, this would translate to total distribution of \u20ac22 billion between 2021 and 2024 versus the \u20ac16 billion we announced with UniCredit unlocked while substantially increasing at the same time. Our CET1 and our capital that should also benefit shareholders in new course. We have our sights also firmly set on future success with clear management priorities that I have already touched upon. We will. NII reduction by managing passthrough across each one of our banks, focusing on targeted volume growth and pricing optimization, and reaping the benefit from our asset and liability management strategy. We have a number of ways to further increase our fee generation across advisory and capital markets, private banking, private the banking payments, and overall insurance. This will provide further support to NII compression when it occurs. Our cost reduction remains targeted effective in further declining our cost base while continuing to fund our investments. We will execute this reduction by simplifying processes, rationalizing our organization and in new and renegotiated supplier contracts. At group levels, our cost of risk should remain structurally low, thanks to our disciplined quality growth, the quality of our credit portfolio and its coverage complemented by conservative provisioning we are well prepared to maintain our cost of risk below 25 business points; even in eventual forecasted peaks resulting from unexpected exceptional and we have \u20ac1.8 billion or 40 basis points of additional overlays that we charge to our P&L in '21 and '22 that can be used exactly for this eventuality, reducing the peak we continue to pursue through RWA efficiency.  We will continue our disciplined management actions, remain focused on capital light products, and increase further the efficiency of our loan backbook as it rolls. These are our current priorities for 2024, which should enable profitability and distribution broadly in line with 2023. This will be supported by the significant foreseen tailwind of a reduction in our systemic charges and benefit in lower integration cost.  Let's now turn to the last slide. Before I close, I would like to take a moment to give you my view on how we look at distributions. We're often described as having outsized distribution, but our ability to offer attractive returns is based on our extremely strong organic capital generation. We're in an enviable position and fairly unique position, a compelling and growing shareholder remuneration an increasing CET1 ratio, even post distribution, and very significant per share value growth.  Our approach to striking the right balance between cash dividend and buybacks is determined by our prevailing valuation and with a view to having a sustainable increase in the dividend year by year. As our valuation improves over time, we're open to gradually increase the cash dividend payout.  To ensure a more attractive cash dividend yield, we are able to deliver outsized distribution versus our peer group whilst significantly increasing our CET1. Our distribution are not relying on distributing our excess capital. That said, we also recognize that we are carrying an ever increasingly larger amount of excess capital that the market seems to currently value at zero. We will return this excess to shareholder if no better use of the capital can be found. This success also gives us confidence in being able to maintain our 2023 distribution for the foreseeable future. Regardless of external factors, this is an advantage relative to our peers. Thank you, and I will now open for questions. \nOperator: [Operator instructions] The first question is from Antonio Reale with BOA. Please go ahead.\nAntonio Reale: Hi, good morning, everyone. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions for me, please. The first one is on capital and the second one on the net profit outlook for 2024. Starting with the first question, which is actually a follow up based on Andrea's remarks. When I look at your increased distribution, even as it stands, you will end basically every year with quite a large stack of excess capital and growing. Your policy has been quite clear. On Slide 30, I think you show the payout as a percentage of organic capital generation, which is now at 70%, but even then, it's starting to look somewhat conservative. What do you think it takes for you to increase that payout to 100% of your organic capital generation, because with that, you wouldn't even be paying any of the excess capital out? At the risk of sounding a bit harsh here, you've marked down your Russian exposure. You have large overlays. You don't really guide to any significant regulatory headwinds going forward. So why not pay 100% of what you generate given, as you said, you have a lot of excess, and so I'm wondering why they need to grow it further. That's my first question. The second question is to do with your net profit guidance. You're guiding to be broader in line to this year also in 2024, so at least \u20ac7.25 billion. Could you talk about how you see the drivers year on year in 2024 versus 2023? I think on Slide 29 you provide some very interesting color on a qualitative basis. Can we maybe talk through and help us understand better the bridge in profitability across those three drivers? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: Okay. So thank you, Antonio. So let's start with capital and distribution and everything else. So firstly I take note and noted on the fact that if we look at our capital as a proportion of organic capital generation or as a proportion of net income, we seem to becoming less aggressive, meaning that if we look at the proportion of distribution, vis-\u00e0-vis net income in '21 and then in '22. Then the indication we're giving for '23 we're distributing ever less relative to net income, a little bit more relative to organic capital generation, which is what drives us. Why are we doing that, because we're not at the end of the year. We have been very clear in saying that our distribution are equal or above to the numbers we're giving you and the numbers will be finalized when we reach the end of a year. We see what the future will take us in 2024 and we have all the elements to take a judgment call. But in general we maintain the fact that we will maintain prudent distribution, which for us are keeping them within our guiding capital generation with an eye on what they are as a proportion of net income, as net income seems to be an industry practice, but I am committed in fulfilling my commitment on distribution, actually on beating them through results. On the excess, it's something different. At some point we will complement what we do organically recurrently and ordinarily, which is what I'm talking about now, with an integration of return of my excess capital over time to complement what we're doing. We are on the second quarter of the year. There is still a lot of uncertainty at the moment. The guidance is what it is. We will refine it as we go through the year.  The second thing is 2024, which I think is quite critical. I think that the whole UniCredit is delivering as best it can for 2023. The role of a management team is to prepare for 2024 and beyond. So as we look at 2024, we look at it in this fashion. Firstly, NII will have an adverse headwinds, assuming that our macro is correct, given that interest rates are going to have plateaued, will have plateaued, and the path through is going to continue to converge.  Now, that effect for us is a little bit greater than peers in Northern Europe, a little bit less than our peers in Italy, given that the markets where the passthrough has the biggest effect are Southern European markets. Now, this adverse effect will be partially offset by what it will be offset by selected volume growth in SMEs and other segments and products across the franchise in retail, which we are in a position now to do at even positive levels. This is also helped by the fact that we continue to grind down our backbook and that grounding. Is an adverse on our loan growth but it's not going to last forever at the same rate. The second thing is that we were, as we said several times originally, let's say under replicated and conservatively replicated, as we bring up our replication to the right run rate for this level of rates, because we expect them to go down at some point, we are bringing in additional revenue.  And Stefano has mentioned it at the current level of interest rate is \u20ac300 million of additional revenues per year. If rates increase, that's more. So these factors together we're anticipating a reduction of NII but a reduction of NII that is less than what you may think because of these offsetting factors. Still a reduction then the second thing is what happens on revenues overall? Well, we are anticipating strong or solid fee income as we continue to invest in our factories. The fee income from our factories is dependent on the macro.  Much lower rates means better fees in asset management, in life insurance and in other things. So there will be a beta effect against positive beta effects on the fees of setting in part the negative beta effects on NII and in our case, let's say propelled by all the investment we're doing in asset management action, in payments, in advisory and capital market, in client risk management, et cetera, et cetera. So that will bridge the gap further or compensate the gap depending on the speed of pass through flowing in our account so that's the revenue line then below the revenue line. We have two other factors. One factor is cost. We're determined to keep our cost base down this year and flat or down next year. We said we had an ambition to still hit UniCredit unlocked pre inflation. That means our cost line still has further room to go down and that I think is a competitive advantage because when NII will reverse people who have not managed their cost line will get a margin squeeze. People who have will not and we will keep on driving this down. I think that's a competitive advantage and we will deliver that. That could give us 150,000,000 of lift again, then we have a cost of risk.  Cost of Risk we are not anticipating a meaningful divergent between what the cost of risk will be for the whole year of '23 and '24. Why that? Because even if we assume an increase in cost of risk underlying due to the deceleration of the economy, we think that the more conservative level of provisions that we have relative to benchmark and the release, the gradual release of overlays. To bash down that peak will allow us to remain at a cost of risk. That is in the ballpark of what it will be this year, given what we know today. So as you see, revenues will go down a lot less or not depending on what we do on the outsetting fashion costs will go down so that's a positive cost of risk remain the same. Now, we have two other buffers that we believe we are unique in having. Number one, as a GC fee we have very significant reduction in systemic charges coming in next year. I think Stanford [ph] has indicated more than one times that is several hundreds, millions of dollars, \u20ac300 million to be the case and we also have that we have told you that this year \u20ac7.25 billion are done absorbing. So after having expensed \u20ac500 million of integration cost to support our efficiency gains, but I don't have to do \u20ac500 million in immigration cost next year. So theoretically I have another \u20ac500 million in there. When you pull it all together, you see that. Of course, we don't have a perfect picture of what the future will be, but based on what we do today and the levers we have that we control, we think we can remain broadly in line year on year and everything is quite granularly explained within our management team.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrea Filtri with Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Filtri: Yes, thank you for taking my question. I've got more of a question on the strategy of how you guide the bank. Everything is going ahead at full steam for 10 consecutive quarters. You continue to upgrade your shareholder remuneration and we're at a point where, with the last fireworks, the share price today is flat. Could you react to the eventual stale price in sort of setting up a reaction function to the share price calibrating share buybacks in a targeted manner to essentially take opportunity of this lack of sensitivity of share price to the results and to the way you see things evolving. Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: Well, if I had the answers, I would do your job, but Andrea, what can I say? I do what I control. Let's look at the silver lining. Number one, I'm never going to sell a share and number two, I am buying stock which is undervalued by the bucket load and the people who are in it are going to see explosive distribution yield and at some point consistent, resilient, recurrent, repeated outperformance is going to trickle in. Why is that today, now being serious? I have my personal understanding of my personal views given my last job. My personal view is that the market has very few specialist investors in banks and how many of us are still left after a decade of drought? Not many. And the money from specialist investor is limited, is long only and moves very slowly as it should. Most of the money that makes the difference is from generalist and generalists by definition don't understand banks.  So what they do is they invest through the cycle on macro rates and rates are capped. They're going down cost of risk cycle and at least looking at the past, which is the one way of looking at it in my opinion, the cost of risk is going to explode. So if you are looking at macro drivers, looking at past performance of European financials, that's what you're doing in order to buy banks. And you are seeing a substantial increase in share price which has occurred anyway.  You're not moving money into it or you are reticent to move money into it. And if on top of it you're based in the United States, you're looking at your own system, which for once is a lot weaker and less resilient than the one of Europe. But you don't know that from the standpoint of what you're looking at. So that's my rationalization. All the management team can do is continue to prove people wrong every quarter by delivering on results ahead of expectation, if we can. And then at some point, hopefully, it trickles into the share price. Thank you, Andrea. Thank you. The next question is from Chris Hallam with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Yeah, good morning, everybody.  So my first question, it's a bit of a follow up from Antonio's earlier question, but just around the phasing of revenues in prior quarters, you've talked about Q2 or Q3 this year being the peak for NII and for fees growth really kicking in from the second half of next year. But given what we're seeing on betas as well as a more benign macro backdrop, are either of those time frames moving at all i.e. NII peaking later or fees recovering earlier? That's my first question.  And then second, you talked about being a benchmark bank and rot for the first half as over 20% at 13% quarter one. So there's clearly a lot of operating leverage in the business right now given all the momentum in NII. But I wanted to hear your thoughts about what you think a sustainable level of return on capital could now be for unit credit through the foreseeable future given the progress you've made on cost and capital efficiency.  And if that longer term Rot is higher than you previously expected, whether that changes where you want to take the business and where you want to invest capital. Okay, so peak and II. So peak and AI is we still feel it's probably, as we said, between Q two and Q three pick and II is driven by two factors, obviously. One is rates. When are we going to peak in rates? And we all assume an increase in rates this week, and some of us assume there will be another one, but very few assume there will be yet another one after that I don't know, but we are reaching the back end of a rates increase cycle. The second thing to which banks are now a lot more, let's say, sensitive to is pass through. As rates have gone where they are, pass through is continuing to converge. So, as we said in the presentation, we see signs of normalization of path through outside of Italy. That is due to the fact that they have reached levels that are, let's say, much more in line to what they were when rates were at this level in the past. Actually, in many cases they have surpassed that, but then at that level it normalizes. In Italy not yet the case. We're still lagging behind, and we're lagging behind because of the structure of the market and the structure of the client base.  But the progression is inevitable. And we are conservatively assuming in our numbers that the path through in Italy will exceed what was the case at similar rates in the past. So, given that rates are at the end of the increase and pass through continuing to grind up, especially in Italy, we think that second to third is the peak.  So far we have been overly cautious on passthrough and so. I don't exclude that the peak is third to fourth if the pass through grinds up slower than we are anticipating this quarter, given that the rates are still going up, but that's the order of magnitude. Okay, then the dynamic is that getting into next year, you're going to have rates that, contrary to the past, we assume staying at higher level for a little bit longer than we were anticipating before.  A few quarters, and then that pass through, given that the exit rate is lower than we had anticipated, takes a little bit more time to get to the levels we were anticipating before. So the support on the commercial side of NII is a little bit better than before on the non-commercial side.  So let's call it the replication and the commercial side with volume growth, we think we can offset some of that. That's why the scenario is more benign than we were anticipating in 2024. Fees? Fees are progressing and it depends on the factory, if you want to put it this way.  If you look at protection, we're talking increases depending on the reference time of 50, 70, 90% volume growth. If you look at our market share and protection, we went from the low single digit to 14% of the market. So that is occurring. Obviously, the base of start was low, but the base of start, when you're growing volume at that rate, does not stay low for a long time. It becomes visible quite soon. If you take asset management, we're still being grinded down, but at the same time, that is giving us time to roll out our initiative, Nova, one market, and other things that we're doing to internalize more of a value chain.  So that is something that. Is going to offset. And when Asset Management cycle comes back in, we think we're going to grow faster than people expect because of this internalization. Then we have payment. I think it's premature to look at the numbers, but I think it will be a contributor advisory capital market and client risk management has given us a lot of satisfaction. And we think that now it's plugged on our captive franchise and delivering. Let's see how the market goes, and so life insurance, we are going to perform, in my opinion, a little bit less well than Peer because we have a much more cautious view on Ramo Primo, which is high volume and high fees, and we're much more focused on unit Linked, which is the market where we have a market share above 40% in Italy and that we're looking to potentially internalize in the next in time, which takes it will take time for us to do that. If that compromise is confirmed, that alone will bring a significant portion of additional other income into our P&L, so all of these things are small, incremental things that are increasing our fee and other income incidents. On revenues that is currently a bit masked by the excellent performance on NII. The other one was sustainable. Rote. Yeah, that's really what I asked myself. If I take RoTE at 13% and I take an environment of rates that is structurally higher than what we have seen in the last decade and this is a very important point that I think is also missed. The rate cycle may be peeping out, but we're going to go to you tell me 2.5, 2.75, 2.25 positive rates for a commercial bank going from minus 50 to those numbers it's massive. You have 60, 70, 55, whatever it is of your P&L that is now production in production and yields, and that combines with a focus gross on EVA positive, has an incremental impact on your rote. So without, if you ask me, a number of gut feeling, we need to aim something around 15% on sustainable basis with a real cost of capital when everything stabilizes 1011, these kind of numbers, maybe twelve, I don't know. But we are determined to exceed the cost of equity and to exceed it by a margin. And I think we can do that, maybe a couple of remarks. Thank you very much. You mentioned also the timing. So the RoTE tangible equity excluding the excess capital for this year, we gathered for around 17%.  Considering that we guided for a profitability for next year broadly in line, you can also draw the consequences in relation to the return on tangible equity for 2024. In relation to the fees, we are not expecting the growth in the second half because all the elements highlighted by Andrea, so all the commercial actions, the normalization of the rates and also an increased level of GDP with the positive impact on the client activity is expected for next year so for '24.\nOperator: The next question is from Giovanni Razzoli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGiovanni Razzoli: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions, another question on the profitability, the NII and in general the return on tangible sustainable return on tangible equity. Can I summarize your detailed comments on the evolution of the profitability of doing credit in saying that we should not believe that the NII people should necessarily present the peak of the profitability for unique trade because if I take all the points that you have mentioned, seems like you do have several levers to 24 and afterwards to still grow your profit or maintain it at the same level with a profitability that is going to be more significantly above your cost of capital.  So I was wondering whether this short sentence can summarize your thoughts. And the second question on more detail on the 2024 cost base. If I'm not mistaken, you seem to assume that your ambition is to keep the cost base for '24 as flat. That in my view would be a great achievement. I was wondering first of all, whether I got it correctly. And secondly, seems like in Italy there are clearly strong pressure to increase the cost of employees. I was wondering how to square this possible inflation in the salary in Italy, which is a target of stable cost base for 2024. \nAndrea Orcel: Thank you. Okay, so peak and AI profitability. So our job is to try and offset the peak NII and reversal with other levers. And I think that that in our case is the result; one of good normalized deliver, but also all the actions that we're doing with UniCredit unlocked. So that means that without repeating all the things we can offset some of the NII reduction or some of the impact on NII from rates and pass through more gross in volume of the segments of clients and products that we want better replication because we were more replicated before.  Less replicated before and that is adding better fees as we continue to invest in our factories and we continue and that will be significant, lower cost and a cost of risk that going forward will be structurally lower than it has been in the past. To that you're adding that when we are through with a lot of the actions, we are going to have run rating some 800 million more between systemic charges and avoided or no longer necessary integration cost that can support some of the gap.  But it is clear that the challenge is to keep it stabilized to this high level and then over time find a new gross trajectory. Obviously the macro is better than I am telling you now the upside exists but at the moment we see what we are cost is. If you look at what has happened in '21, in '22 and now in '23 we have seen act the inflation and attacked the efficiency of a group since day one front loading and aggressively streamlining their organization.  You can't just cut cost across the board. You need to cut cost in a disciplined and surgical fashion. We have done that, we have supported that with hundreds. In integration cost. And we continue to take down what we take down a headcount significantly. Look at our headcount when we start and what it is today. We take down the non HR cost which are linked to all the contracts that we have. We had providers with 19 different contracts at Unicredited.  Now we go for one and bring significant offsetting on cost reduction given volumes and other things. So cost has been an obsession of ours, but it has been an obsession on of others that is executed while keeping a very attentive eye to continued investment and to reinvesting in the front end and in digital, so that it doesn't affect negatively revenue. It actually supports the further growth. This approach has still quite a bit to run, certainly all of '24 and certainly all of '23 -- sorry, certainly all of '23 and certainly all of '24. It's premature to see. What we do in Italy will be totally consistent with agreement with the trade unions through pre-retirement and through whatever the negotiation of a new contract is, which we have seen coming for a long time and we have already prepared for.\nOperator: The next question is from Britta Schimdt - Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nBritta Schimdt: Yeah, hi there. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. Can you just confirm again, did you mention that you will start addressing the excess capital position at the end of 2023? I guess depending on any inorganic investments you would like to undertake on some of your factories. Or would this rather be left for a little bit later? And then secondly, just coming back on the cost point, can you just reiterate what sort of cost savings you anticipate in your billions for 2024 and what underlying inflation trends you expect, given also the wage bargaining that's still outstanding in Germany? \nAndrea Orcel: Thank you. Okay, so excess capital position, obviously, is dependent on how much capital we're going to distribute this year, which will be equal or in excess of \u20ac6.5 billion. What we have said that we're committed to is whatever that distribution will be, our CET1, that performer for total distribution was 14.9% at yearend, 2022 will be no less, actually will be materially more.  So whatever the distribution that we do, we will have materially more CT One at the end of this year. That means that our excess capital, you can calculate, is about \u20ac1.5 billion. It's about \u20ac3 billion per point above 12.5%, 13% and that's what we are carrying. Going into 2024, we are set to do exactly the same i.e., we will have distribution that are broadly in line with the one of this year, given the condition that I have discussed in terms of profitability and everything else, and organic capital generation.  And we will target again to distribute while not reducing the excess capital also, the CET1 that we will have accumulated at the end of '23. So if you look at the trajectory, we've gone from the 13.5% area, then we have climbed to 49%, we will be above 49%, and then we will climb again to above whatever numbers we have at the end of this year. That is what we are doing with the ordinary distribution. Clearly it leaves us room to improve them because we are, I think, one of the very few, if not the only one to distribute and increase CT One.  At some point we're going to distribute and not increase CT One and then at another point we're going to distribute and give back to shareholders the excess capital. Most peers are in the third phase, we are in the first phase and we need to flow through the other two, which gives us very strong confidence on the absolute amount of distribution being defensible for the long term on cost, cost saving.  Where are we? So inflation first as a reference, inflation in our footprint 2023, about 7.1% excluding Russia, 5.5% in Eurozone, 6.2% in Italy, 6.1% in Germany. Inflation in 2024 expected 3.1% in our footprint, 2.4% in Eurozone, 2.4% in Italy, 2.8% in Germany. This is the reference points that we're using and on the reference point that we're using, we will continue. So this year we will decrease cost year on year from 2022 to 2023 and in '24 the minimum we're aiming to do is to keep them flat.  If we can, we're going to go below. And how are we going to do that? With continuous streamlining, simplification way of working, deburocratization of the organization, targeting processes that used to have 25 steps and no automation. And we are going to end to end automated process. So it's a long grading hygiene that we roll and roll and roll process after process, releasing resources and supporting these changes. Clearly the axis of FTE are negotiated with every trade union in every market where we are and are consistent with those negotiations. No more, no less.\nOperator: The next question is from Ignacio Cerezo with UBS. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Cerezo: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on Germany around asset feels to me that it's probably the country that pre imposed war has probably suffered the largest slowdown in terms of their macro environment basically within the Eurozone, but we are not really seeing any signs of TT ratio. And you seem to allocate actually a small portion of the overlays to the country. What gives you the comfort or how can you reassure the market basically run again, Germany not being a negative outlier within the asset quality picture in the group. And then the second thing shorter if you can give us updated view on plans on Russia, I've kind of perceived a little bit of higher noise from the regulator around the need to get out of Russia for all the European banks. What is your view here? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: So let me take Russia while Stefano will take the rest. So on Russia, facts as opposed to perception, credit has reduced 69% of our exposure in Russia since March 2022. That's \u20ac4.3 billion. I don't think anybody else has done anything like that. Okay. The impact of in this quarter alone I think we have compressed locally another billion. We continue to grind down. What we're doing there is to be consistent with local laws and sanction and with the sanctions and the directives that western governments give us and the strategy is identical to what we have said. It's a gradual, progressive, orderly reduction of our exposure towards the country. That's what we do and it has been quite successful. We will continue to do that.  In terms of added attention, I think the attention is the one that there has been since day one and its maximum from everybody and we continue to execute on that basis. Just as a reminder, the impact on capital of the local participation in the absolute worst scenario from extreme loss is about 30 basis points locally and another about 10 basis points on what remains of our cross border portfolio.  The last thing that I would like to say so that you have an idea if you look at net loans so net of provisions at constant effects our cross border exposure to Russia has gone down in five quarters 69% and our local 48% for a blended 54%. So I don't think you could ask from anybody to do something more decisively within obviously regulation and laws and everything else. And that's what we are going to continue to do maintaining the risk under control.\nStefano Porro: For Germany, we are expecting for this year GDP negative so slightly below zero around 0.3. Next year we are expecting to have a GDP growth in relation to the quality of the portfolio. The portfolio is really good if we look to the expected loss of the stock of the portfolio in Germany is 14 basis point 14 and also the origination, the new origination, the new business petal loss Q2 is similar to the one of Q1. With regards to the dynamic of the default rate, I was commenting today the default rate of the group at 0.8% for Germany is below because it's 0.5% and is remaining below one. It was below one also last year it was 0.5%. Q1 is remaining 0.5 also this year. We are not expecting in the case of Germany for the forthcoming future, a meaningful deterioration of our portfolio.\nOperator: The next question is from Delphine Lee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDelphine Lee: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So my questions first one is on NII. Just coming back to the deposit mean your assumption does include a small acceleration in the increase in the pass through. So I was just wondering what you think are the main drivers for the acceleration. And then my second question is going back to excess capital. There's going to be a little bit of a gap on share buybacks between the second tranche of 1 billion and the one you're going to run for four year 23.  Is there any possibility, given where your CT One and NDA buffer stands to kind of already anticipate a buyback ahead of four year results announcement to start something that is maybe extraordinary buyback you talked about, complementing it and what's preventing you from starting other way now? \nAndrea Orcel: Thank you. So I'll take the excess capital and the SBB and everything else. There's nothing stopping us. And everything is possible at the time being. It doesn't seem that the market is very sensitive to our distributions, but seriously, nothing is stopping us and we are reassessing the situation because one thing is to be consistent with our sustainable ordinary distribution and getting to a level that we are confident we can support over time.  The other thing is the correct judgment on two factors. One is how much cash dividend in the mix. And two is whether we should overlay earlier the return of the excess capital to our ordinary distribution or not and we are reviewing those topics all the time. And obviously the higher the excess capital, the more there is a, let's say, driver to consider extreme redistribution on top of the ordinary. For the time being, there is no decision, nothing is stopping us beyond shareholder approvals and obviously ECB approval, but we are relatively comfortable on those on net interest income dynamic, especially in relation to the deposit beta assumption. Less are from the current situation. So. The average deposit beta is around 24%.  That's very differentiated by each country or geography. So Italy is around 11%. In the case of Germany, we are above 30%, Central Europe is around 35 and Eastern Europe is 25%. Andrea commented before in relation to the assumption for 2024, these are assumption.  So we are assuming to have a general deposit beta above the historical levels that for the group were between 30% and 35%, where we are assuming to be slightly below 40%. That means in every geography we are assuming to be above the historical levels. So to give you the sense, for example, in Germany and Central Europe we're assuming to be above 40%, while in Italy and Eastern Europe to be above 330. In 2024, in each geography we're assuming to be above historical levels. The dynamic of the rates in terms of velocity was unprecedented. In some of the countries, the increase of the deposit beta is normalizing, so is moderating, and in some other country, like Italy, is low, is very low, is currently sticky and below the historical level. So that's why we think it's appropriate in terms of future projection to assume, let's say a normalization towards the level that we had many years ago and being conservative in terms of assumption as already allied before. If the dynamic will be different in comparison to this assumption, we will have tailwinds on the dynamic of the net interest income.\nOperator: We will now take our last question from Hugo Cruz with KBW. Please go ahead.\nHugo Cruz: All right, thank you for the time. Just a clarification on some of the previous questions and comments. First off on NII, I understood you will assume that the beta will continue to go up after the end of this year. So you're ending at below 40%. So where do you think the average next year will be? Second, on the capital distribution, are you also considering the potential introduction of an interim dividend or interim dividends? And then third, your comment on the sustainable RTE of 15%, is that net of the excess capital that you already have? So assuming, I would imagine a CTE ratio around 13% or is that with the excess capital included?\nAndrea Orcel: So on interim dividends, I think it's premature for us. So no, we've discussed before, let's call them interim share buybacks. That's possible with respect to so that's on capital distribution, maybe you'll take the NII.\nStefano Porro: So the average for this year will be slightly below 30%. In terms of assumption is assuming a next hit rate in Q4 in terms of positive beta below 40%. While for next year we were assuming slightly below 40%. That's the average for the year. To be combined with the dynamic of the rates that is envisioning for next year and normalization. So in terms of interest rate average, the average can be similar in comparison to the one of this year, but we are assuming to have a next year rate at the end of 2024 in terms of your LIBOR, lower than the rate that we are assuming at the end of 2023.\nHugo Cruz: Thank you. Thank you very much.\nOperator: So that was the last question. I turned the conference back to the UniCredit management for the closing remarks.

        "text": "Liquidity has remained stable, pass-through and cost of risk more benign and profitability at elevated levels. We continue to push into the future, the expected shocks within this environment UniCredit's excellent results are a demonstration of a resilience of not only Europe, but of the European banks. Yes, risk remains and inflation combined with a possible further economic slowdown and the development of new technology needs to be managed. So we remain vigilant. We take pre-emptive actions, prudent and ready to adapt. But what this presentation will demonstrate is the excellent progression of UniCredit unlocked and of our industrial and cultural transformation, but our people are leading the evolution and doing so as one team united by the same principle, the same values and with the same mission.  The vision driving that mission is for UniCredit to be the bank for Europe's future and a new benchmark for banking. Let's start our presentation with slide two, I guess. Is it working? 1 second. Okay, let me start with a snapshot of our current results. This show just how well we are progressing towards realizing that vision. We have delivered our 10th consecutive quarter of profitable growth, the best second quarter and first half ever. Underlying net profit in the first half of the year was \u20ac4.5 billion or in excess of that. This is adjusted for \u20ac230 million of integration cost that we are expensing to continue supporting our operational efficiency improvements in the face of inflation whilst becoming more agile and self-funding significant investments. Net revenue rose 38% year-over-year. This is especially impactful. Sorry, we seem to be having a problem with slide, one second. Here we go. Sorry. Yeah. Let's see if they stay. Yes. Okay. So net revenue rose 38% year on year. This is especially impactful given the drag from targeting quality growth, one that shows risk, discipline, improvement of mix and a focus on EVA positive transaction. Costs fell 1% and RWA 7% year-on-year in spite of gross, inflation and our investment for the future. The effectiveness of our operational and capital levers is shown in our 39% cost income ratio and our 8% net revenue on RWA ratio. Both are best ever, industry-leading and a result of improvement on both variable of the ratio, so both numerator and denominator. So far this year, our return on tangible equity at 13% CET1 is at 21%. It is still at 17%, considering the excess capital that we still carry. Our CET1 reached 16.6%, structurally higher than our target of 12.5% to 13%, whilst at the same time we will have distributed in excess of \u20ac15.5 billion between 2021 and 2023, well above our initial target. This is thanks to our much higher than initially expected profitability and organic capital generation. Indeed, we generated 210 basis points or \u20ac6.5 billion of capital in the first half alone. The strategy we're implementing is uniting our bank as one empowered franchise, capable of delivering consistent quality, profitable growth and outsized distribution over the long term. As such, we are upgrading both our net income and distribution guidance respectively, to equal or greater than \u20ac7.25 billion and \u20ac6.5 billion, while absorbing yet upsized integration cost of \u20ac500 million and continuing to increase our CET1 year-over-year, all providing a strong foundation and outlook for 2024, as we expect to be broadly in line with the increasing higher bar set this year, we've clearly identified levers to achieve it. What you're seeing with this result is the combination of a sector benefiting from generally supportive macro, some of which is structural, as we're not going back to negative rates and the large contribution from the relentless execution of UniCredit unlocked. The latter is what continues to drive our differentiation versus peers and enables us to beat expectation. Let me take you again through its essence, understanding it is understanding our transformation to date and our further potential. Let's start with our winning strategy to achieve our vision. We have a group-wide determination to put clients at the center to understand what they want today and what they will need tomorrow. We serve them across three foundational countries, boosted by ten of the fastest growing and most innovative markets in Europe coming together as one. This is a bank that represents a new and emerging Europe powered by a renewed single group mindset that truly unlocks the unique value for our clients and other stakeholders of being pan European. We provide our clients with a differentiated service that combines local reach with European interconnection and group-wide product factories that leverage an ecosystem of best in class partners, powered by an increasingly harmonized, forward-looking digital data and operations across our group. All is underpinned by solid principle and values that our people chose, live and breathe day to day.  Then we move to our ongoing industrial and cultural transformation, unique in that from within and employee led. We are strengthening our client proposition, distribution power and product factories while streamlining our organization, processes and way of working across all banks, all supported by our technology evolution. We continue to invest in the business for the long term, making the necessary structural changes to be future-proofed and resilient. This allows us to support our communities through social programs, our clients and people to go through challenging times and our commitment to use and education. This approach serves all of our stakeholders well while delivering exceptional targeted financial outcome. As we continue to strive for excellence and execute relentlessly on UniCredit Unlocked, I am confident that our financial performance is set to continue through 2023, 2024 and beyond. Let's turn to Slide four. Let me now take you through how we are deploying our strategy in further detail. Clients UniCredit Unlocked is primarily driven by around our 50 million clients across Europe, serving them and their communities locally, but benefiting from tools available to a group of our size and nature. For most of our franchise countries, experts make up 50% of GDP. So our footprint is a unique gateway to the continent and possible expansion. We have overlaid this with industrial actions designed to ensure our clients not only connect, but also have access to premium tailor-made products, access the way they prefer. This is supported by investments in our network, which we continue to upgrade and technology aiming to create the branch of a future in which an omnichannel approach combines a digital offering with passionate skilled people delivering best in class solutions, all within a higher quality and seamless client experience. Our clients are served by 13 banks who are leaders in their own market. We have refocused our previously inward looking organization towards our clients. We have reunified our client franchises, harmonized group segmentation and return coverage and day-to-day decision to our banks and within our banks to the frontline. This model relies on both a clear unified framework of reference and our diverse talent who have the best understanding of the local market and dynamics. Talent which is critical for us to attract, retain and develop, which is why we hired around 2,000 people and we are providing them with circa 30 hours of training to maintain pace within digitization, product development, risk and ESG. Each market is now equally served by group product factories, which we pulled out from the individual banks and centralized. These in-house factories leverage our group-wide scale and scope, also to support an ecosystem of top class partners. The most recent example is Mastercard. We signed a ground-breaking partnership in June the first time any large commercial bank had put in place a single card exclusive multi-market strategy of this scale in Europe. This partnership underscore our one UniCredit approach and are further unifier across all of our market. The centralization of our factories and group-wide partners, combining with delayering, simplification of processes and way of working, training and putting back decision capabilities in the right places are delivering the divisional result you have witnessed today and in the last 10 quarters, best-in-class, in each market, in each business. All of these pillars are being facilitated and enhanced by a gradually more streamlined and group-wide approach to technology and operation. The first phase of our digital evolution is nearing completion, taking back control of our heavily fragmented and outsourced technology, bringing it in house and selectively investing in it. We have hired more than 700 developers since 2022 and are upscaling our people to ensure that we have the right capabilities engaging our providers from a group standpoint, instead of individually and streamlining the way of working to lower cost and most importantly, time to market. We have invested in cleaning and simplifying products and processes, freeing up resources, time and investment dollars, which can be repositioned towards what we really need. The second phase will be the gradual transformation to a modern, digital and data-driven organization, which will see the acceleration of automation, design of new tools and best-in-class platforms to improve our client responsiveness and more efficiency in the increasing of our consumption of technology. All of this is united by a holistic culture driven by core values and a common set of principle chosen by our people and embodied in our actions. Our industrial and cultural transformation has powered our last 10 quarters, delivered differentiated performance, and rebased our key financial metrics. We now have a sustainable competitive advantage that we are determined to further consolidate. Let me take you through our new transform core financial KPIs and their drivers. We believe we have cost leadership. This is critical to maintain a differentiated level of profitability, particularly given recent and prospective inflationary pressures. It is also critical to maintain our edge over fintechs and other market players. We have moved from force to efficiency leadership in Q1. This is a structural change versus the past and is driven by targeted cost reduction that does not affect, but rather invests and propels the quality of our revenue growth. In absolute terms, we have reduced our cost base since 2017 by 18%. Critically, however, since 2021 this was done while substantially propelling and increasing both gross and net revenue, rather than shrinking them. We aim to continue and even strengthen this competitive advantage. Quality revenue growth, we transformed both the growth and quality of our earnings. We moved from revenue laggard to revenue leader, delivering 10 successive quarters of top tier quality growth. We fundamentally transformed our ability to grow our revenue base, while improving our mix. Targeted quality revenue growth has meant being disciplined on risk, delivering EVA positive new business and focusing on fees and other capital light EVA positive sources. Net revenue to RWA improved from 10th to third, whilst fees to RWAs improved from fifth to second as we're strengthening our factories. We have and will continue to address weaknesses generated by past retrenchment, but so are selling or constraining quality businesses. We have made significant progress in rebuilding our high value added client content in a number of ways. Firstly, organically by hiring best-in-class talent attracted by our ability to deliver 15 million clients across Europe in a captive fashion. This is the case in both advisory and capital market and client risk management, demonstrated by the caliber of talent NineHouse and the visible results. These are targeted to our existing client base. Secondly, by selectively internalizing critical part of the value chain, for example in asset management building central product selection and packaging, able to deliver projects such as Nova and One Markets. Thirdly, through our two way partnership with best-in-class product provider such as Allianz, Azimut and more recently, Mastercard. Finally, we are reviewing further opportunities of growth, for example in payments both corporate and retail, where we see a significant opportunity and in unit linked, where we could internalize our dominant business in Italy. All of this requires significant investment in talent, in training, in technology, to both power group-wide factories and local distribution channels and deliver seamless integration between them. Let me give you an example to explain that point. Let's take insurance. We have already rationalized our providers from nine to four and transformed them into partners. Today Allianz designs best in class protection products tailored for our clients. Together, we have trained our people and provided insights to our clients. The result is a step up in our Italian protection market share to 14%. We're taking it even further. An integrated tech platform at group level is being launched, allowing real time access to product with streamlined processes and technology solution. This will further power our growth in the segment. Our transform quality revenue capacity is another competitive advantage that we will continue to focus on. Structural lower cost of risk; over the past few years, our gross net NPs have fallen dramatically respectively to 2.6% and 1.4%. Our underlying cost of risk has structurally declined from at least 40 basis points to 50 basis points to 20 basis points to 25 basis points, so subject to confirmation within a longer time series. Indeed, our underlying cost of risk, excluding Russia and overlays between 21 and in 2023 year to date, has been well below 20 basis points, reaching single digit basis points over each one of the last six quarters. It has benefited from a particularly benign environment and write-backs from repayments, which underscore how conservative we are on staging, classification and provisioning generally. This is due to the substantially higher quality of our credit portfolio as compared to the past that we have markedly accelerated since 2020. Second, the substantial more conservative absolute and relative to peers both backward and forward looking staging and provisioning policy, we are covered much higher in every NPE stage. We believe we have moved firmly at the forefront of our peer group in this matter and are better prepared than any to weather the current macro and geopolitical uncertainty. As a result, cost and cost of risk are much more within our control now in the next few years than most of the market had realized. We are prepared with this healthy provision and overlays in a quality credit portfolio to provide a solid buffer and positively differentiate cost of risk, both for now and in case the market turns. This is another competitive advantage and we are determined to continue strengthening it. Capital excellence, our transform capital efficiency has been a major contributor to our sustainable performance and we ranked first on this measure relative to peers in Q1. This has three main drivers. First, we focus on deploying, sorry, slide. We focus on deploying capital above the cost of equity. 77% of corporate RWAs are now to SCBA positive clients as we improve the profitability of our legacy portfolio and our discipline in new business. Second, we improve the profitability of our commitments via crosssell and pricing or ultimately exiting or securitizing position where accretive. Third, we are growing capital-light products. This is yet another competitive advantage that supports our return on tangible equity and organic capital generation. We are determined to continue building upon it. Our P&L advantages combine with those of our balance sheet, creating performance with strengths. Our CET1 remains best-in-class among peers. We continue to grow capital in spite of our best-in-class distribution, thanks to our outsized organic capital generation. Our liquidity ratio remains strong, sustainable and well above peer average, allowing better management of margins. We maintain a high quality credit portfolio with conservative proactive staging and provisioning, further improved by high overlays and lower default rate. We are focused on investing wisely to maintain profitable risk-adjusted return for the long term to the benefit of all our stakeholder and in many forms. These last two slides have sought to explain what a dramatically different group UniCredit is today, despite being less than two years into our strategic plan. Our commitment to continuing this fundamental and holistic transformation remains, as does our commitment to delivering strong, sustainable result and distribution. It is our knowledge of how much more this transformation can unlock that gives us confidence in the future beyond the effect of this positive macro. Let's now get back to the present. This is our tenth consecutive quarter of quality profitable growth. We have balanced our three levers to deliver this in a sustainable fashion. Net revenues rose significantly in both the half and the quarter, driven by quality NII growth and a tightly managed pass through. Fees remain robust, especially if we exclude the impact of lower current account fees in Italy that had not yet been waived by all banks. This is \u20ac20 million adverse per month and cost of risk at very levels, both given macro and the new change UniCredit I have just described. Of particular note is the dynamic of our deposit pass through below expectation at circa 24% and showing signs of approaching more normalized levels outside of Italy. This supports our new pass through guidance. We have been able to more than compensate the inflationary pressure on cost, both in the half and in the quarter while continuing to invest. Integration cost enable us to continue on this path, and we're stepping them up. The positive momentum in our gross operating profit continues again beating expectation. It rose close to 52% in Q2 and 42% in H1. Our capital excellence continue with both outsized capital generation and further consolidation of best-in-class CET1. UniCredit return on tangible equity continues to rise and we are surpassing our peers on this metric, having significantly lagged until a few years ago. At the same time, thanks to our substantial share buyback at depressed valuation, we are further propelling a very significant per share value creation. We are fairly unique in this respect. Let me take you now through each country or region. Our Italian business had yet another excellent quarter, demonstrating its ability to deliver sustained quality, profitable growth and outstanding returns well above peers. Net revenue rose 19% year-over-year to \u20ac5.2 billion, gross revenue up '23. This was driven by NII growth of 66%. Thanks to strict management of the pass through. Fees were down 5.2% year-on-year, mostly due to active relief provided to customer on current account applied since April. Without such relief, our fees would have been down only 2.6%. We saw good result in asset under custody, products and excellent ones in protection as was commenting. Costs fell 2% in Italy, thanks to our continued focus on simplification and streamlining and despite continuing investment both in the front line with Circa 370 new hires in 2023 and in our branches with Circa 550 completely renewed branches from the beginning of 2022. RWAs were reduced by 12%. As a result, we achieved a strong operating and capital efficiency with a 35.5% cost income ratio and 9.1% net revenue to RWAs. Profit before tax rose 31% to \u20ac2.9 billion, RoAC exceeded 25% and the region contributed 86 basis points, or \u20ac2.7 billion of organic capital generation to the group.  Our commitment to our community, clients and employees remain undiminished this quarter, delivering amongst other things, the launch of a second tranche of UniCredit per l'Italia a \u20ac10 billion package to support clients, both individuals and business. We also introduced a package of up to \u20ac1 billion to support those impacted by the May floods and offered mortgages dedicated to energy sustainability to help family and individuals in the realization of their housing projects. Today's strong set of result and the very concrete step we have taken to support families and businesses confirm that financial and social objectives are not in conflict, demonstrating that UniCredit can deliver for the benefit of our investors and of Italy as a whole. Germany; Germany's structural transformation continued to power excellent result. Net revenues were up 13% year-over-year. Gross revenues were up 14%. This was driven by NII up 9% and fees up 5% driven in part by the successful delivery of our capital-light corporate financial advisory business and also asset management fees. Cost fell nearly 5.3% in Germany with the ongoing transformation more than compensating for inflation and setting a new run rate for the future. RWAs were down 5% year-over-year. We also achieved a very strong operating and capital efficiency in Germany with a 41.7% cost income ratio and 7.3% net revenue on RWA ratio. Profit before tax was up 36% at \u20ac1.3 billion. RoAC reached 18.7% and the region delivered 57 business points or \u20ac1.8 billion of organic capital to the group. We continue to invest in our clients and our frontline delivering the introduction of a cashless advisory branch model for local high quality customer advice. Our corporate client portal has released further functionalities including the introduction of power of attorney self-service. This quarter has seen Germany continue to deliver simplification with integration of COO and Digital to deliver a full end-to-end and customer-focused approach. All of this is resulting in US being named top employer in Germany for the 13th time in a row and receiving the EDGE Move certification for D&I in 2022. Central Europe, Central Europe's quarter was defined by consistent stability and delivery of high profitability. Net revenues were up 29% year-over-year, gross were up 27%. This was driven by NII up 39%, fees slightly down following general market pressure but up in transaction and financing. Costs remained flat year-over-year as the discipline continue across all countries and our focus on operating and capital efficiency was reflected in a \u20ac38.5 cost income ratio and 7% net revenue on RWA ratio. Profit before tax was up 65% to \u20ac1.1 billion. RoAC was 20.6% and the region delivered, sorry, delivered 29 basis points or \u20ac0.9 billion of capital organically. We have made significant progress in retail digitalization signing up 67,000 new clients in first half, '23 in Czech Republic and Slovakia alone. We launched our first green mortgage covered bond in the Czech Republic and succeeded in obtaining the Green Start Certificate in Slovenia. We established the inaugural Girls Go Finance Event to strengthen girls' understanding of finances through our partnership with Teach For Austria, an initiative we intend to roll out across all of our Teach For All markets. Eastern Europe; Eastern Europe profitability continued at pace this quarter, driven by business intensity and further efficiency gains. Net revenues were 47% year-over-year, with gross revenue up 31%. This was powered by both NII up 44% and fees up 4%. Our focus on active cost management continued to balance a continuous efficiency drive with investment in digitalization and automation. Our focus on operating and capital efficiency was reflected in a 34.1% cost income ratio and 9.2% net revenue on RWA ratio. Profit before tax landed at \u20ac800 million. RoAC was 34.4% and the region delivered 18 basis points or \u20ac600 million of capital organically. We continue to invest in our network and business and customer transformation. This quarter, we introduced cashless branches in Bulgaria. We effectively balanced our S with our E commitments, rolling out a number of social programs for vulnerable groups focused on use in Romania, whilst also supporting the employees of this group. At the same time, we saw \u20ac170 million of new lending to renewable energy within Bulgaria. Client Solution as we have discussed extensively about our investment in our factories, we will now provide just some key highlights and additional data for this quarter. Client solution revenue was resilient in the first half and relative to a strong base. Revenue fell 3% year-on-year and would have been up 1% excluding Russia. Corporate solution revenue fell 2% in the first half but grew by 3%. Excluding Russia, overall fees were up 5% year on year with RWA consumption down 13%. Driving record profitability, transaction and payment revenue rose 12% year on year, while advisory and capital markets was up seven and reached the number one fee ranking in its home market. Client risk management revenue fell 13% but would have been flat excluding Russia. Specialized lending was down 9% year on year, but flat normalized for TLTRO and one large one off. Individual solution revenue fell 4% year-over-year. Strong performance in protection continued while life insurance remained under pressure, particularly as we kept discipline around RAMOPRIMO. Brokerage and custody showed the strongest growth up 90% led by strong client demand for bond products. Our commitment to our purpose begins with us and the actions and decision we take with respect to our own people, our clients and those communities that we are intrinsically part of. These actions were evident in the overview that I gave for each one of the regions, action targeted for the need and challenges of each local market, but beyond that, whether it is closing the gender pay, the partnership we forged to fight discrimination, supporting arts and culture, the work of our foundation, which will now invest this year alone \u20ac20 million in project to support, use and education of our UniCredit start lab, our commitment to deliver on our purpose a central tenet of our strategic plan. I am now handing over to Stefano, who will provide more detail on our numbers on H1."

        "speaker": "Stefano Porro",
        "text": "Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 18. Before I take you through the second quarter '23 results, please note the my comments are based on a year-on-year comparison, that second quarter '23 versus second quarter '22, unless otherwise noted. Let's look at the P&L in more detail, starting with revenue. In the second quarter, we generated a record \u20ac6 billion revenue up 25%, mainly thanks to an increase in net interest of about \u20ac1 billion. Revenue in second quarter includes the \u20ac60 million negative impact from current account fiat pricing in Italy. Trading activity at \u20ac0.5 billion, up 32%, supported by the fixed income, currency and commodities business. This quarter also benefited from higher treasury contribution. We took \u20ac0.1 billion impairments in profit for investment in the quarter, mostly from participation in Russia, Italy and Austria. Systemic charges in second quarter include \u20ac27 million tax on extra bank profits in Hungary as the government changed the methodology for the 2023 calculation as flagged last quarter. Let's turn to the next slide. Let me share some highlights of UniCredit's strong balance sheet and robust liquidity position. Our favorable liquidity position, starts with the structure of our balance sheet and a loan-to-deposit ratio well below 100% at a stable and sound 90%. We have a resilient and diversified deposit base. More than 80% of our deposit are from retail and SME clients. Our deposit market share across the group is stable. The decrease in volumes in the quarter are mainly driven by corporate, using their cash buffer and our focus on pricing. Thanks to our superior liquidity profile and balance sheet strength, we are in a position to be able to do so. Retail deposit volumes were broadly stable. Clients kept diversifying their saving into more asset under custody products, in particular BTPs in Italy, and they are keeping their asset with us with our TFAs up \u20ac11 billion in the quarter. Total deposits are still comfortably above pre-2020 levels. We expect the overall deposit volume to continue slightly declining in 2023 as we prioritize pricing management and quality net interest income, and as there is further rotation to asset under custody or asset under management. This is also reflected in our deposit beta, which I will discuss in more detail later. Our liquidity cover ratio at second quarter '23 was above 100% the after TLTRO repayments, in line with our managerial target range at 125% to 150%. We have a large liquidity buffer with about \u20ac215 billion liquid assets effectively unchanged, compared to the quarter before. Let's turn to Slide 20 and focus again on the quarter. Net interest income was \u20ac3.5 billion, up 6% quarter-on-quarter We continue to experience a positive net interest dynamic driven by higher loan rates and still low deposit beta. Net interest margin at 2.1%, up nine basis point in the quarter. Customer loan rates are up 43 basis point in the quarter across our regions, leveraging on higher interest rates and thanks to our commercial actions. Average client loan volumes relevant for net interest are down \u20ac4.3 billion in the quarter, driven by Germany and Italy, mainly short term loans for SME and large corporate. Clients demand for lending has declined in the first half of the year and is expected to remain contained as a consequence of higher rates. We remain focused on more profitable capital efficiency loans while supporting our clients. Loan volumes are bolstered by \u20ac3.3 billion in USG lending in the quarter as we continue assisting our client screen transition and support social initiatives. The increase in the customer deposit rate is limited to 20 basis points for the quarter, while the average Euribor three months was up 73 basis points. Our average deposit pricing is below the system across most of our regions. Average commercial deposit decreased by \u20ac8.9 billion in second quarter, mainly in Germany, but also Austria, driven by a few large corporates. We expect retail deposit market share to remain stable, while corporate deposit dynamic will continue to be lumpy. We have updated our managerial interest guidance and sensitivity. Based on a 3.75% ECB deposit facility rate from the third quarter, remaining stable thereafter and a deposit beta below 40% and the end of the year, we expect an improved full year '23 net interest income guidance at least \u20ac13.2 billion. This is mainly thanks to a better average deposit beta for the year slightly below 30%. The observed deposit beta for the group for both side and term deposit in second quarter is around 24%, an increase as we expected, but less than assumed. The slight increase in the quarter is mainly driven by Austria. In Italy we still have a low level of circa 11%. We continue to see a shift from site to term deposit. However, site for the group is still 75%. The recent TLTRO maturities did not have a material impact on the market or UniCredit funding cost. The net interest income sensitivity for a one percentage point of deposit beta is about \u20ac130 million at current rates and deposit volume assumption. The net interest income impact from an ECB deposit facility rate increase of 50 basis point is about \u20ac0.3 billion, which also depends on our client behavior and competitive dynamics develop. If the ECB starts to reduce short term rates, our deposit replicating portfolio, which is factored into our net interest income guidance will continue to support our net interest income. At today's interest rate levels, the run rate net interest income will be supported by about \u20ac0.3 billion per year. Let's turn to Slide 21. Fees in second quarter were \u20ac1.9 billion, up 2% excluding the current account fee reduction in Italy were \u20ac60 million in the quarter, in line with our guidance. Continuous strong performance in transactional fees and better financing fees more than offset still subdue investment fees. We are well-diversified and balanced as you can see from the year-on-year development of the different component parts of our fees. Transactional fees were up 1% or 11% excluding current account fee reduction in Italy, thanks to robust payment and card fees driven by client activity and property and casualty insurance growth in Italy. Repriced current account fees in Italy will continue to negatively impact transactional fees by about \u20ac20 million per month to yearend 2023. Financing fees are up 2% thanks to a recovering global capital market activity and loan fees in Germany more than offsetting higher securitization cost stemming from our active portfolio management strategy and lower credit protection insurance linked to retail mortgages in Italy. Investment fees were down 3% on reduced management fees due to lower average asset under management stock, mainly in Italy. Asset under management gross sales. And upfront fees are stable. Client aging fees were stable as we keep on supporting our clients in defending their business outcome in this volatile environment.  Let's turn to Slide 22. We reduced costs 1.2% year on year, while inflation in our footprint was above 8% in first half 2023. Let's take a closer look at HR and on HR cost developments. HR costs down 1% year on year benefiting from lower FTS down 4.6% to 73,000, supported by earlier retirement plans becoming effective in Italy.  The trade union agreement in Italy is currently being renegotiated on a national level, while the German one is valid until mid-2024. Austria closed the annual agreement at the beginning of 2023, and the mandatory salary increase of about 8% is already included in second quarter '23. Results non HR costs are down 1.4% thanks to a tight cost management and remediation actions compensating the overall inflation impact. Although integration costs are not included in the cost line, we incurred \u20ac214 million in second quarter '23. We expect for the full year to have around \u20ac0.5 billion. This is to further allow us to reduce the structural long term cost base of the group while keep hiring and investing. Let's turn to Slide 23. Cost of risk was at very low two basis point in the quarter, supported by our still low default rate at 0.8% and the good performance on repayments and back to Bonnies. We kept our overlay LLPs on performing loans stable in the quarter at around \u20ac1.8 billion to be used for any shocks or to be released in the following two years.  Our underlying cost of risk net of overlays in Russia has reset and was single digits basis point over the last six quarters. The cost of risk in the quarter includes our Biannual IFRS nine macro scenario update with corresponding LLPs stable in Italy. The cost of risk of 21 basis points reflects ongoing sound asset quality. Cost of risk for Germany and Eastern Europe is low at seven and four basis points respectively. In Central Europe, we had the negative cost of risk because of MP repayments leading to LLP releases.  Our updated spillover analysis and details of our commercial erect exposure can be found in the Annex and confirm the soundness of our group risk profile. The group's expected loss on your business at 27 basis points also confirms the credit quality of our portfolio origination and our discipline is ingrained in our organization.  Let's turn to slide 24. Our underlying asset quality remain robust gross MPs at \u20ac12.1 billion, reduced by about \u20ac0.5 billion in second quarter. The MP reduction was driven by unlikely to pay portfolio disposal in Italy, which lowered the share of unlikely to pay impasse due.  Still comparable AI at 76%, MP coverage ratio at 48%. Broadly stable quarter on quarter MP coverage does not include overlays on performing loans which come on top. Let's turn to Slide 25 in second quarter, our risk weighted asset stood at \u20ac295 million, down \u20ac4 billion quarter on quarter, driven by continued active portfolio management measure worth \u20ac3.5 billion including securitization and the reduction of low performing businesses.  Risk weighted assets are down \u20ac22 billion year on year and are expected to remain below \u20ac300 billion also by year end. Let's turn to slide 26 in second quarter, we organically generated 101 basis point of capital, 77 basis point from net profit and 24 basis point through our active risk credit asset management way ahead of our plan. We completed the two point 34,000,000,001st share by back tranche and launched the remaining \u20ac1 billion second tranche for 2022. As of 21 July, UniCredit purchased shares equal to 6.5% of the share capital for a total consideration of some \u20ac2.4 billion. Before I hand back to Andrea one item of note the Hungarian extra profit tax has been extended to 2024 as well and we it to be broadly in line with this year amount which was \u20ac75 million. Please Andrea, the floor is yours."

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Thank you, Stefano. I will now finish with some closing remarks we're now incorporating in. The improved assumption on rates and pass through as well as cost of risk. We are also further stepping up in the execution of Unicreated unlocked key industrial drivers. As such, we are upgrading again our net profit guidance for 2023 to at least \u20ac7.25 billion, an increase of around 1.6 billion from our initial guidance at the beginning of this year, despite absorbing \u20ac500 million in integration costs that were not budgeted at the beginning of the year.  Accordingly, our distribution intention for 2023 has improved to a minimum of \u20ac6.5 billion, \u20ac1.25 billion higher than our guidance at the start of the year. Ass cash dividend shall be at least \u20ac2.4 billion up 25% year-on-year versus \u20ac1.9 billion of 2022 and circa 35% up.  Based on the current number of shares, we are confident that we will maintain this profitability and distribution at broadly this level for 2024. Given our clear levers to deliver within this reference macro, sorry, this would translate to total distribution of \u20ac22 billion between 2021 and 2024 versus the \u20ac16 billion we announced with UniCredit unlocked while substantially increasing at the same time. Our CET1 and our capital that should also benefit shareholders in new course. We have our sights also firmly set on future success with clear management priorities that I have already touched upon. We will. NII reduction by managing passthrough across each one of our banks, focusing on targeted volume growth and pricing optimization, and reaping the benefit from our asset and liability management strategy. We have a number of ways to further increase our fee generation across advisory and capital markets, private banking, private the banking payments, and overall insurance. This will provide further support to NII compression when it occurs. Our cost reduction remains targeted effective in further declining our cost base while continuing to fund our investments. We will execute this reduction by simplifying processes, rationalizing our organization and in new and renegotiated supplier contracts. At group levels, our cost of risk should remain structurally low, thanks to our disciplined quality growth, the quality of our credit portfolio and its coverage complemented by conservative provisioning we are well prepared to maintain our cost of risk below 25 business points; even in eventual forecasted peaks resulting from unexpected exceptional and we have \u20ac1.8 billion or 40 basis points of additional overlays that we charge to our P&L in '21 and '22 that can be used exactly for this eventuality, reducing the peak we continue to pursue through RWA efficiency.  We will continue our disciplined management actions, remain focused on capital light products, and increase further the efficiency of our loan backbook as it rolls. These are our current priorities for 2024, which should enable profitability and distribution broadly in line with 2023. This will be supported by the significant foreseen tailwind of a reduction in our systemic charges and benefit in lower integration cost.  Let's now turn to the last slide. Before I close, I would like to take a moment to give you my view on how we look at distributions. We're often described as having outsized distribution, but our ability to offer attractive returns is based on our extremely strong organic capital generation. We're in an enviable position and fairly unique position, a compelling and growing shareholder remuneration an increasing CET1 ratio, even post distribution, and very significant per share value growth.  Our approach to striking the right balance between cash dividend and buybacks is determined by our prevailing valuation and with a view to having a sustainable increase in the dividend year by year. As our valuation improves over time, we're open to gradually increase the cash dividend payout.  To ensure a more attractive cash dividend yield, we are able to deliver outsized distribution versus our peer group whilst significantly increasing our CET1. Our distribution are not relying on distributing our excess capital. That said, we also recognize that we are carrying an ever increasingly larger amount of excess capital that the market seems to currently value at zero. We will return this excess to shareholder if no better use of the capital can be found. This success also gives us confidence in being able to maintain our 2023 distribution for the foreseeable future. Regardless of external factors, this is an advantage relative to our peers. Thank you, and I will now open for questions. "

        "text": "Hi, good morning, everyone. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions for me, please. The first one is on capital and the second one on the net profit outlook for 2024. Starting with the first question, which is actually a follow up based on Andrea's remarks. When I look at your increased distribution, even as it stands, you will end basically every year with quite a large stack of excess capital and growing. Your policy has been quite clear. On Slide 30, I think you show the payout as a percentage of organic capital generation, which is now at 70%, but even then, it's starting to look somewhat conservative. What do you think it takes for you to increase that payout to 100% of your organic capital generation, because with that, you wouldn't even be paying any of the excess capital out? At the risk of sounding a bit harsh here, you've marked down your Russian exposure. You have large overlays. You don't really guide to any significant regulatory headwinds going forward. So why not pay 100% of what you generate given, as you said, you have a lot of excess, and so I'm wondering why they need to grow it further. That's my first question. The second question is to do with your net profit guidance. You're guiding to be broader in line to this year also in 2024, so at least \u20ac7.25 billion. Could you talk about how you see the drivers year on year in 2024 versus 2023? I think on Slide 29 you provide some very interesting color on a qualitative basis. Can we maybe talk through and help us understand better the bridge in profitability across those three drivers? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Okay. So thank you, Antonio. So let's start with capital and distribution and everything else. So firstly I take note and noted on the fact that if we look at our capital as a proportion of organic capital generation or as a proportion of net income, we seem to becoming less aggressive, meaning that if we look at the proportion of distribution, vis-\u00e0-vis net income in '21 and then in '22. Then the indication we're giving for '23 we're distributing ever less relative to net income, a little bit more relative to organic capital generation, which is what drives us. Why are we doing that, because we're not at the end of the year. We have been very clear in saying that our distribution are equal or above to the numbers we're giving you and the numbers will be finalized when we reach the end of a year. We see what the future will take us in 2024 and we have all the elements to take a judgment call. But in general we maintain the fact that we will maintain prudent distribution, which for us are keeping them within our guiding capital generation with an eye on what they are as a proportion of net income, as net income seems to be an industry practice, but I am committed in fulfilling my commitment on distribution, actually on beating them through results. On the excess, it's something different. At some point we will complement what we do organically recurrently and ordinarily, which is what I'm talking about now, with an integration of return of my excess capital over time to complement what we're doing. We are on the second quarter of the year. There is still a lot of uncertainty at the moment. The guidance is what it is. We will refine it as we go through the year.  The second thing is 2024, which I think is quite critical. I think that the whole UniCredit is delivering as best it can for 2023. The role of a management team is to prepare for 2024 and beyond. So as we look at 2024, we look at it in this fashion. Firstly, NII will have an adverse headwinds, assuming that our macro is correct, given that interest rates are going to have plateaued, will have plateaued, and the path through is going to continue to converge.  Now, that effect for us is a little bit greater than peers in Northern Europe, a little bit less than our peers in Italy, given that the markets where the passthrough has the biggest effect are Southern European markets. Now, this adverse effect will be partially offset by what it will be offset by selected volume growth in SMEs and other segments and products across the franchise in retail, which we are in a position now to do at even positive levels. This is also helped by the fact that we continue to grind down our backbook and that grounding. Is an adverse on our loan growth but it's not going to last forever at the same rate. The second thing is that we were, as we said several times originally, let's say under replicated and conservatively replicated, as we bring up our replication to the right run rate for this level of rates, because we expect them to go down at some point, we are bringing in additional revenue.  And Stefano has mentioned it at the current level of interest rate is \u20ac300 million of additional revenues per year. If rates increase, that's more. So these factors together we're anticipating a reduction of NII but a reduction of NII that is less than what you may think because of these offsetting factors. Still a reduction then the second thing is what happens on revenues overall? Well, we are anticipating strong or solid fee income as we continue to invest in our factories. The fee income from our factories is dependent on the macro.  Much lower rates means better fees in asset management, in life insurance and in other things. So there will be a beta effect against positive beta effects on the fees of setting in part the negative beta effects on NII and in our case, let's say propelled by all the investment we're doing in asset management action, in payments, in advisory and capital market, in client risk management, et cetera, et cetera. So that will bridge the gap further or compensate the gap depending on the speed of pass through flowing in our account so that's the revenue line then below the revenue line. We have two other factors. One factor is cost. We're determined to keep our cost base down this year and flat or down next year. We said we had an ambition to still hit UniCredit unlocked pre inflation. That means our cost line still has further room to go down and that I think is a competitive advantage because when NII will reverse people who have not managed their cost line will get a margin squeeze. People who have will not and we will keep on driving this down. I think that's a competitive advantage and we will deliver that. That could give us 150,000,000 of lift again, then we have a cost of risk.  Cost of Risk we are not anticipating a meaningful divergent between what the cost of risk will be for the whole year of '23 and '24. Why that? Because even if we assume an increase in cost of risk underlying due to the deceleration of the economy, we think that the more conservative level of provisions that we have relative to benchmark and the release, the gradual release of overlays. To bash down that peak will allow us to remain at a cost of risk. That is in the ballpark of what it will be this year, given what we know today. So as you see, revenues will go down a lot less or not depending on what we do on the outsetting fashion costs will go down so that's a positive cost of risk remain the same. Now, we have two other buffers that we believe we are unique in having. Number one, as a GC fee we have very significant reduction in systemic charges coming in next year. I think Stanford [ph] has indicated more than one times that is several hundreds, millions of dollars, \u20ac300 million to be the case and we also have that we have told you that this year \u20ac7.25 billion are done absorbing. So after having expensed \u20ac500 million of integration cost to support our efficiency gains, but I don't have to do \u20ac500 million in immigration cost next year. So theoretically I have another \u20ac500 million in there. When you pull it all together, you see that. Of course, we don't have a perfect picture of what the future will be, but based on what we do today and the levers we have that we control, we think we can remain broadly in line year on year and everything is quite granularly explained within our management team."

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Well, if I had the answers, I would do your job, but Andrea, what can I say? I do what I control. Let's look at the silver lining. Number one, I'm never going to sell a share and number two, I am buying stock which is undervalued by the bucket load and the people who are in it are going to see explosive distribution yield and at some point consistent, resilient, recurrent, repeated outperformance is going to trickle in. Why is that today, now being serious? I have my personal understanding of my personal views given my last job. My personal view is that the market has very few specialist investors in banks and how many of us are still left after a decade of drought? Not many. And the money from specialist investor is limited, is long only and moves very slowly as it should. Most of the money that makes the difference is from generalist and generalists by definition don't understand banks.  So what they do is they invest through the cycle on macro rates and rates are capped. They're going down cost of risk cycle and at least looking at the past, which is the one way of looking at it in my opinion, the cost of risk is going to explode. So if you are looking at macro drivers, looking at past performance of European financials, that's what you're doing in order to buy banks. And you are seeing a substantial increase in share price which has occurred anyway.  You're not moving money into it or you are reticent to move money into it. And if on top of it you're based in the United States, you're looking at your own system, which for once is a lot weaker and less resilient than the one of Europe. But you don't know that from the standpoint of what you're looking at. So that's my rationalization. All the management team can do is continue to prove people wrong every quarter by delivering on results ahead of expectation, if we can. And then at some point, hopefully, it trickles into the share price. Thank you, Andrea. Thank you. The next question is from Chris Hallam with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Yeah, good morning, everybody.  So my first question, it's a bit of a follow up from Antonio's earlier question, but just around the phasing of revenues in prior quarters, you've talked about Q2 or Q3 this year being the peak for NII and for fees growth really kicking in from the second half of next year. But given what we're seeing on betas as well as a more benign macro backdrop, are either of those time frames moving at all i.e. NII peaking later or fees recovering earlier? That's my first question.  And then second, you talked about being a benchmark bank and rot for the first half as over 20% at 13% quarter one. So there's clearly a lot of operating leverage in the business right now given all the momentum in NII. But I wanted to hear your thoughts about what you think a sustainable level of return on capital could now be for unit credit through the foreseeable future given the progress you've made on cost and capital efficiency.  And if that longer term Rot is higher than you previously expected, whether that changes where you want to take the business and where you want to invest capital. Okay, so peak and II. So peak and AI is we still feel it's probably, as we said, between Q two and Q three pick and II is driven by two factors, obviously. One is rates. When are we going to peak in rates? And we all assume an increase in rates this week, and some of us assume there will be another one, but very few assume there will be yet another one after that I don't know, but we are reaching the back end of a rates increase cycle. The second thing to which banks are now a lot more, let's say, sensitive to is pass through. As rates have gone where they are, pass through is continuing to converge. So, as we said in the presentation, we see signs of normalization of path through outside of Italy. That is due to the fact that they have reached levels that are, let's say, much more in line to what they were when rates were at this level in the past. Actually, in many cases they have surpassed that, but then at that level it normalizes. In Italy not yet the case. We're still lagging behind, and we're lagging behind because of the structure of the market and the structure of the client base.  But the progression is inevitable. And we are conservatively assuming in our numbers that the path through in Italy will exceed what was the case at similar rates in the past. So, given that rates are at the end of the increase and pass through continuing to grind up, especially in Italy, we think that second to third is the peak.  So far we have been overly cautious on passthrough and so. I don't exclude that the peak is third to fourth if the pass through grinds up slower than we are anticipating this quarter, given that the rates are still going up, but that's the order of magnitude. Okay, then the dynamic is that getting into next year, you're going to have rates that, contrary to the past, we assume staying at higher level for a little bit longer than we were anticipating before.  A few quarters, and then that pass through, given that the exit rate is lower than we had anticipated, takes a little bit more time to get to the levels we were anticipating before. So the support on the commercial side of NII is a little bit better than before on the non-commercial side.  So let's call it the replication and the commercial side with volume growth, we think we can offset some of that. That's why the scenario is more benign than we were anticipating in 2024. Fees? Fees are progressing and it depends on the factory, if you want to put it this way.  If you look at protection, we're talking increases depending on the reference time of 50, 70, 90% volume growth. If you look at our market share and protection, we went from the low single digit to 14% of the market. So that is occurring. Obviously, the base of start was low, but the base of start, when you're growing volume at that rate, does not stay low for a long time. It becomes visible quite soon. If you take asset management, we're still being grinded down, but at the same time, that is giving us time to roll out our initiative, Nova, one market, and other things that we're doing to internalize more of a value chain.  So that is something that. Is going to offset. And when Asset Management cycle comes back in, we think we're going to grow faster than people expect because of this internalization. Then we have payment. I think it's premature to look at the numbers, but I think it will be a contributor advisory capital market and client risk management has given us a lot of satisfaction. And we think that now it's plugged on our captive franchise and delivering. Let's see how the market goes, and so life insurance, we are going to perform, in my opinion, a little bit less well than Peer because we have a much more cautious view on Ramo Primo, which is high volume and high fees, and we're much more focused on unit Linked, which is the market where we have a market share above 40% in Italy and that we're looking to potentially internalize in the next in time, which takes it will take time for us to do that. If that compromise is confirmed, that alone will bring a significant portion of additional other income into our P&L, so all of these things are small, incremental things that are increasing our fee and other income incidents. On revenues that is currently a bit masked by the excellent performance on NII. The other one was sustainable. Rote. Yeah, that's really what I asked myself. If I take RoTE at 13% and I take an environment of rates that is structurally higher than what we have seen in the last decade and this is a very important point that I think is also missed. The rate cycle may be peeping out, but we're going to go to you tell me 2.5, 2.75, 2.25 positive rates for a commercial bank going from minus 50 to those numbers it's massive. You have 60, 70, 55, whatever it is of your P&L that is now production in production and yields, and that combines with a focus gross on EVA positive, has an incremental impact on your rote. So without, if you ask me, a number of gut feeling, we need to aim something around 15% on sustainable basis with a real cost of capital when everything stabilizes 1011, these kind of numbers, maybe twelve, I don't know. But we are determined to exceed the cost of equity and to exceed it by a margin. And I think we can do that, maybe a couple of remarks. Thank you very much. You mentioned also the timing. So the RoTE tangible equity excluding the excess capital for this year, we gathered for around 17%.  Considering that we guided for a profitability for next year broadly in line, you can also draw the consequences in relation to the return on tangible equity for 2024. In relation to the fees, we are not expecting the growth in the second half because all the elements highlighted by Andrea, so all the commercial actions, the normalization of the rates and also an increased level of GDP with the positive impact on the client activity is expected for next year so for '24."

        "text": "Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions, another question on the profitability, the NII and in general the return on tangible sustainable return on tangible equity. Can I summarize your detailed comments on the evolution of the profitability of doing credit in saying that we should not believe that the NII people should necessarily present the peak of the profitability for unique trade because if I take all the points that you have mentioned, seems like you do have several levers to 24 and afterwards to still grow your profit or maintain it at the same level with a profitability that is going to be more significantly above your cost of capital.  So I was wondering whether this short sentence can summarize your thoughts. And the second question on more detail on the 2024 cost base. If I'm not mistaken, you seem to assume that your ambition is to keep the cost base for '24 as flat. That in my view would be a great achievement. I was wondering first of all, whether I got it correctly. And secondly, seems like in Italy there are clearly strong pressure to increase the cost of employees. I was wondering how to square this possible inflation in the salary in Italy, which is a target of stable cost base for 2024. "

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Thank you. Okay, so peak and AI profitability. So our job is to try and offset the peak NII and reversal with other levers. And I think that that in our case is the result; one of good normalized deliver, but also all the actions that we're doing with UniCredit unlocked. So that means that without repeating all the things we can offset some of the NII reduction or some of the impact on NII from rates and pass through more gross in volume of the segments of clients and products that we want better replication because we were more replicated before.  Less replicated before and that is adding better fees as we continue to invest in our factories and we continue and that will be significant, lower cost and a cost of risk that going forward will be structurally lower than it has been in the past. To that you're adding that when we are through with a lot of the actions, we are going to have run rating some 800 million more between systemic charges and avoided or no longer necessary integration cost that can support some of the gap.  But it is clear that the challenge is to keep it stabilized to this high level and then over time find a new gross trajectory. Obviously the macro is better than I am telling you now the upside exists but at the moment we see what we are cost is. If you look at what has happened in '21, in '22 and now in '23 we have seen act the inflation and attacked the efficiency of a group since day one front loading and aggressively streamlining their organization.  You can't just cut cost across the board. You need to cut cost in a disciplined and surgical fashion. We have done that, we have supported that with hundreds. In integration cost. And we continue to take down what we take down a headcount significantly. Look at our headcount when we start and what it is today. We take down the non HR cost which are linked to all the contracts that we have. We had providers with 19 different contracts at Unicredited.  Now we go for one and bring significant offsetting on cost reduction given volumes and other things. So cost has been an obsession of ours, but it has been an obsession on of others that is executed while keeping a very attentive eye to continued investment and to reinvesting in the front end and in digital, so that it doesn't affect negatively revenue. It actually supports the further growth. This approach has still quite a bit to run, certainly all of '24 and certainly all of '23 -- sorry, certainly all of '23 and certainly all of '24. It's premature to see. What we do in Italy will be totally consistent with agreement with the trade unions through pre-retirement and through whatever the negotiation of a new contract is, which we have seen coming for a long time and we have already prepared for."

"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Thank you. Okay, so excess capital position, obviously, is dependent on how much capital we're going to distribute this year, which will be equal or in excess of \u20ac6.5 billion. What we have said that we're committed to is whatever that distribution will be, our CET1, that performer for total distribution was 14.9% at yearend, 2022 will be no less, actually will be materially more.  So whatever the distribution that we do, we will have materially more CT One at the end of this year. That means that our excess capital, you can calculate, is about \u20ac1.5 billion. It's about \u20ac3 billion per point above 12.5%, 13% and that's what we are carrying. Going into 2024, we are set to do exactly the same i.e., we will have distribution that are broadly in line with the one of this year, given the condition that I have discussed in terms of profitability and everything else, and organic capital generation.  And we will target again to distribute while not reducing the excess capital also, the CET1 that we will have accumulated at the end of '23. So if you look at the trajectory, we've gone from the 13.5% area, then we have climbed to 49%, we will be above 49%, and then we will climb again to above whatever numbers we have at the end of this year. That is what we are doing with the ordinary distribution. Clearly it leaves us room to improve them because we are, I think, one of the very few, if not the only one to distribute and increase CT One.  At some point we're going to distribute and not increase CT One and then at another point we're going to distribute and give back to shareholders the excess capital. Most peers are in the third phase, we are in the first phase and we need to flow through the other two, which gives us very strong confidence on the absolute amount of distribution being defensible for the long term on cost, cost saving.  Where are we? So inflation first as a reference, inflation in our footprint 2023, about 7.1% excluding Russia, 5.5% in Eurozone, 6.2% in Italy, 6.1% in Germany. Inflation in 2024 expected 3.1% in our footprint, 2.4% in Eurozone, 2.4% in Italy, 2.8% in Germany. This is the reference points that we're using and on the reference point that we're using, we will continue. So this year we will decrease cost year on year from 2022 to 2023 and in '24 the minimum we're aiming to do is to keep them flat.  If we can, we're going to go below. And how are we going to do that? With continuous streamlining, simplification way of working, deburocratization of the organization, targeting processes that used to have 25 steps and no automation. And we are going to end to end automated process. So it's a long grading hygiene that we roll and roll and roll process after process, releasing resources and supporting these changes. Clearly the axis of FTE are negotiated with every trade union in every market where we are and are consistent with those negotiations. No more, no less."

We continue to grind down. What we're doing there is to be consistent with local laws and sanction and with the sanctions and the directives that western governments give us and the strategy is identical to what we have said. It's a gradual, progressive, orderly reduction of our exposure towards the country. That's what we do and it has been quite successful. We will continue to do that.  In terms of added attention, I think the attention is the one that there has been since day one and its maximum from everybody and we continue to execute on that basis. Just as a reminder, the impact on capital of the local participation in the absolute worst scenario from extreme loss is about 30 basis points locally and another about 10 basis points on what remains of our cross border portfolio.  The last thing that I would like to say so that you have an idea if you look at net loans so net of provisions at constant effects our cross border exposure to Russia has gone down in five quarters 69% and our local 48% for a blended 54%.

It was below one also last year it was 0.5%. Q1 is remaining 0.5 also this year. We are not expecting in the case of Germany for the forthcoming future, a meaningful deterioration of our portfolio."

        "text": "Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So my questions first one is on NII. Just coming back to the deposit mean your assumption does include a small acceleration in the increase in the pass through. So I was just wondering what you think are the main drivers for the acceleration. And then my second question is going back to excess capital. There's going to be a little bit of a gap on share buybacks between the second tranche of 1 billion and the one you're going to run for four year 23.  Is there any possibility, given where your CT One and NDA buffer stands to kind of already anticipate a buyback ahead of four year results announcement to start something that is maybe extraordinary buyback you talked about, complementing it and what's preventing you from starting other way now? "

        "text": "Thank you. So I'll take the excess capital and the SBB and everything else. There's nothing stopping us. And everything is possible at the time being. It doesn't seem that the market is very sensitive to our distributions, but seriously, nothing is stopping us and we are reassessing the situation because one thing is to be consistent with our sustainable ordinary distribution and getting to a level that we are confident we can support over time.  The other thing is the correct judgment on two factors. One is how much cash dividend in the mix. And two is whether we should overlay earlier the return of the excess capital to our ordinary distribution or not and we are reviewing those topics all the time. And obviously the higher the excess capital, the more there is a, let's say, driver to consider extreme redistribution on top of the ordinary. For the time being, there is no decision, nothing is stopping us beyond shareholder approvals and obviously ECB approval, but we are relatively comfortable on those on net interest income dynamic, especially in relation to the deposit beta assumption. Less are from the current situation. So. The average deposit beta is around 24%.  That's very differentiated by each country or geography. So Italy is around 11%. In the case of Germany, we are above 30%, Central Europe is around 35 and Eastern Europe is 25%. Andrea commented before in relation to the assumption for 2024, these are assumption.  So we are assuming to have a general deposit beta above the historical levels that for the group were between 30% and 35%, where we are assuming to be slightly below 40%. That means in every geography we are assuming to be above the historical levels. So to give you the sense, for example, in Germany and Central Europe we're assuming to be above 40%, while in Italy and Eastern Europe to be above 330. In 2024, in each geography we're assuming to be above historical levels. The dynamic of the rates in terms of velocity was unprecedented. In some of the countries, the increase of the deposit beta is normalizing, so is moderating, and in some other country, like Italy, is low, is very low, is currently sticky and below the historical level. So that's why we think it's appropriate in terms of future projection to assume, let's say a normalization towards the level that we had many years ago and being conservative in terms of assumption as already allied before. If the dynamic will be different in comparison to this assumption, we will have tailwinds on the dynamic of the net interest income."

First off on NII, I understood you will assume that the beta will continue to go up after the end of this year. So you're ending at below 40%. So where do you think the average next year will be? Second, on the capital distribution, are you also considering the potential introduction of an interim dividend or interim dividends? And then third, your comment on the sustainable RTE of 15%, is that net of the excess capital that you already have? So assuming, I would imagine a CTE ratio around 13% or is that with the excess capital included?"

While for next year we were assuming slightly below 40%. That's the average for the year. To be combined with the dynamic of the rates that is envisioning for next year and normalization. So in terms of interest rate average, the average can be similar in comparison to the one of this year, but we are assuming to have a next year rate at the end of 2024 in terms of your LIBOR, lower than the rate that we are assuming at the end of 2023."

    "transcript": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before I hand over to Magda Palczynska, Head of Investor Relations, a reminder that today's call is being recorded. Madam, you may begin.\nMagda Palczynska: Good morning, and welcome to UniCredit's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Conference Call. Andrea Orcel, our CEO, will take you through the results. This will be followed by a Q&A session with Andrea and Stefano Porro, our CFO. Please limit yourself to two questions. With that, I will hand over to Andrea.\nAndrea Orcel: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we will walk you through what you have achieved thanks to our UniCredit Unlocked plan, our goals and our outlook for 2024. I have always stated that my ambition is to build a bank that is strongly grounded in the right principles and values, one that delivers long-term quality growth and value for all our stakeholders, our shareholders, our employees, our clients and our communities. As we report our 12th consecutive quarter of quality profitable growth across all regions, I can proudly say that in these last three years we have fulfilled this ambition. For our shareholders, we delivered quality growth, operational and capital excellence, sustainable profitability, capital generation and distributions, all underpinned by strong capitalization, liquidity and asset quality. For our employees, we have focused on providing a motivating vision, a rewarding and merit-based environment, a culture to which they identify and ultimately pride in what we are achieving. And for our clients and community, they are at the heart of everything we do. We have improved the quality of service and support we provide, offering best-in-class product through diversified, integrated and strengthened channels. This commitment to delivering and pursuing excellence has been our guiding principle and driven all that we have done so far and it will continue to be our focus as we move ahead. UniCredit had its best year ever in 2023, the culmination of a three-year journey which delivered for the present while transforming our bank and preparing for the future. We will review our past accomplishments and look ahead to 2024 and beyond, where our sights are set on new heights. This is the year we grew our net profit to \u20ac8.6 billion, up 54% while continuing to invest in the future and expensing \u20ac1.1 billion of integration costs. Without these, our net profit would have been \u20ac9.5 billion. We delivered a record return on tangible equity of 16.6%, 5.8 points higher than last year, or 20.5% with a CT1 ratio of 13% adjusting for our notable excess capital. Fourth quarter was much better than expected, with net profit up 19% despite higher integration costs to secure our future. Without them, net profit would have been up 37%. We generated \u20ac12 billion in capital organically this year, underpinning our proposed distribution of \u20ac8.6 billion, or 100% of net profit, \u20ac3 billion dividend and \u20ac5.5 billion share buyback, while reinforcing our CT1 ratio by 100 basis points to 15.9%. Following new EBA rules, we adjusted Q4 CT1 and will continue to adjust going forward as we accrue distribution, both cash and share buyback. Our cumulative past three years distribution exceeds \u20ac17.5 billion, more than our market cap at the beginning of 2021. At the same time, we increased CT1 by circa \u20ac10 billion in the period. Our per share growth continues to be industry leading, with EPS up 74%, DPS 80%, and tangible book per share up 17% this year. The quality of such growth is underscored by the progress on our three financial levers and a 12% reduction in share count over the year, 30% reduction since the beginning of 2021. In 2024, we aim to maintain net profit broadly in line with 2023 record level, normalizing our best year ever while further improving the quality of our results across the P&L, delivering double digit growth in EPS and DPS. We expect the tailwind from interest rates and cost of risk to gradually fade. The impact from continuing to scale down Russia while our fees, which have grown to represent 32% of our revenues, should further increase their weight. As we work to deliver these results, we will reward our shareholders with outside calendar year distribution of approximately \u20ac10 billion. We consider 2024 the start of a second phase of UniCredit Unlocked, rooted in the same vision, the same strategy and mostly the same levers as we continue our transformation. We will defend our profitability and the leadership achieved in operational and capital efficiency as well as cost of risk. We will strive to further improve the quality of our results, continuing to deploy our capital profitably while growing our capital-light businesses. We shall strive to sustain best-in-class distribution while strengthening our bank and continue to deliver value for investors through substantial earnings and dividend per share growth. Let me now take you through UniCredit's best year ever, a testament to our commitment to excellence and our ability to adapt to changing market conditions. 2023 has been an exceptional year for UniCredit, with a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter in which we took the opportunity to absorb even more integration costs than anticipated. Our key metrics highlight the outstanding performance across our three financial levers. Net revenue increased 26% to \u20ac23.2 billion, with gross revenue up 17%. We have continued to improve our operational efficiency, reducing costs by 1% to \u20ac9.47 billion, while absorbing inflation and investment. Our cost-income ratio has further dropped by 7.2 percentage points to 39.7% for the year. Similarly, we have continued to improve our capital efficiency, with RWA decreasing 2% to \u20ac284.5 billion, with net revenue to RWAs reaching 7.9% up 2.1 points. We reached a record return on tangible equity of 16.6%, notwithstanding \u20ac1.1 billion of integration costs and a significant capital buffer. Indeed, our underlying return on tangible equity at 13% CT1 ratio reached 20.5%, 22.4% if we excluded integration costs. All these lead to \u20ac12 billion or 389 basis points of organic capital generation, underpinning our proposed increased distribution of \u20ac8.6 billion or 100% of 2023 net profit. Let me now take you through the main item of our P&L in greater detail. We report a significant increase in net revenues, growing 26% year-over-year. This was driven by excellent net interest income and resilient fees, while our cost of risk remained significantly lower than our guidance of 20 to 25 basis points through the cycle. Our trading revenues continue to show resiliency and stability as primarily driven by client business. Our NII grew 31% year-over-year and was sequentially flat in the quarter, driven by rates rising 218 basis points on average in the year and 21 basis points in the quarter across our footprint, coupled by strict pass-through management, which reached 28% in Q4 and averaged at 25% in the full year. We continue our focus on quality risk adjusted, simplified EVA positive origination, profitable and capital efficient client business rather than value-destroying volumes, which together with subdued loan demand led to client volume dropping \u20ac8.5 billion in the quarter. The rise in customer deposit rates was small with clients continuing to shift their savings into assets under custody products. However, our already strong liquidity position improved, with LCR increasing to above 145% and loans to deposit ratio decreasing to 86%. Our NII sensitivity is updated to \u20ac130 million per percentage point change of deposit beta and \u20ac140 million per 25 basis points change of the ECB deposit facility rate. We view NII and cost of risk as intimately linked, both in the way that we look at our numbers and the way we manage our franchise and our KPIs. These numbers demonstrate what we have said quarter after quarter. We have a robust and high-quality credit portfolio at \u20ac428 billion with a low default rate, a very meaningful reduction of NPE to \u20ac11.7 billion with improved quality mix and coverage, as well as a lower expected loss on new business, confirming our vigilant approach towards new origination. The last 12 quarters show a structurally lower and less volatile underlying cost of risk net of overlays in Russia, at an average of 16 basis points and always below 22, versus approximately 60 basis points on average from 17 to 19. This transform and strong asset quality underpins our 2023 cost of risk of 12 basis points, 28 basis points in the quarter as we took the opportunity to further build up our market-leading overlays and provision to protect or further propel our future results. We have and will continue to make substantial progress in our fee line. Notwithstanding consistent macro headwinds, we have grown our fees each and every year since 2021. We've compounded annual growth rate of 2% from 2021 to 2023 once we exclude the impact from current account fees and accelerated securitization cost. In 2023, fees grew 1% excluding \u20ac180 million reduction in current account fees in Italy to the benefit of our clients and higher securitization costs. Today, UniCredit fee structure is well diversified. It is balanced with a top tier fee to revenue ratio of 32.3%. Full potential from past and future investment as the impact from internalization is yet to be realized. Despite inflation across our geographic footprint and investment in our people, franchise and technology, we have been able to reduce cost 3% in a targeted fashion between 2021 and 2023. Growth of such investment and inflation, our costs would have dropped 13%. The fourth quarter of 2023 saw [Indiscernible] flat year-on-year in spite of a significant increase in our bonus pool. This is evidence in our commitment to paying for performance and recognition of the hard work of our people. Our focus on profitable capital deployment led to a net revenue to risk-weighted asset ratio increase to 7.9% in 2023, up from 5% in 2021. We generated 389 business points of capital organically in 2023, or \u20ac12 billion, well above our net profit, leveraging our quality focus and excellent portfolio management with proactive RWA management. Risk-weighted assets stood at circa \u20ac285 billion, down almost \u20ac25 billion in the year. In 2023, UniCredit CT1 ratio increased almost 100 business points from 14.91% to 15.89%, showing our ability to distribute capital whilst continuing to substantially strengthen our capitalization. Over the last three years, our CT1 ratio has grown despite absorbing business requirements and substantial regulatory headwinds and returning \u20ac17.6 billion to our shareholders. Let me now outline our results through the prism of our business, starting with client solutions. Our factories generated \u20ac9.9 billion in 2023, of which fees accounted for 64%. This is a 1% rise from the previous year if we leave out Russia, which we continue to scale down, showing the steady performance of our banks, backed by our factories in spite of challenging market conditions. Corporate solutions brought in a revenue of \u20ac4.9 billion, a decline of 6% from the previous year, mainly due to the cutback of the Russian business and TLTRO, without which we would have been flat. Within corporate solutions, advisory and capital markets were up 11% and trade and correspondent banking 5%, as they both continue to leverage our unique footprint. Deals of note include the Eurogroup, L'Automatica, [ph] Ferretti IPOs and Upower [ph] Leverage Buyout. Payments increased 12% driven by NII growth, boosted by our better leveraging of our European presence and recent investment in the business. Please remember that 90% of payments revenues are fee driven. Individual solutions still face a difficult macro environment leading to a 4% drop. However, we see positive signs in the growth of managed funds and especially in non-CPI protection, which was up 40% year-on-year. Our Italian business delivered another quarter of outstanding results. \u20ac5.6 billion of profit before tax, up 29% year-over-year. Net revenue reached \u20ac10.5 billion, up 19% with gross revenues aligned. Net interest income grew 50% whilst fees were almost flat when excluding current account fee reduction done for the benefit of our clients and securitization cost. Cost of risk remained low at 22 basis points, stable at 19 basis points in the quarter. Cost decreased by 1.8% leading to a cost income ratio of 35.8%, and down 7.8 points year-on-year, with continued focus on shrinking non-business activities and optimizing processes also through technology. Our focus on capital efficiency improved net revenue to RWA by 2.5 points to 9.3% in Italy, with an increase of ROAC by 8.5 points to 25.7%. Italy generated 168 basis points of \u20ac5.2 billion of capital organically this year. Significant progress has been made industrially. We launched 28 one market funds. We hired over 600 people while shrinking non-business staff by 700. We provided 1.2 million hours of training through UniCredit University to our staff. Finally, we continue to invest in our distribution channel, including by refurbishing our branches and launching buddy R-Evolution. We have remained steadfast in our commitment to supporting individuals, households and businesses investing \u20ac10 billion euros through UniCredit per l'Italia. All these efforts have been recognized with UniCredit being named Bank of the Year Italy 2023 by the banker. Our German franchise achieved its best result in over a decade, reaching profit before tax of \u20ac2.1 billion up 18% year-over-year. Net revenue reached \u20ac5.3 billion, increasing 13% with gross revenue up 8%. NII was up 4% and fees 1%. Cost of risk of 14 basis points was down 16 basis points versus 2022. Germany showcased operating efficiency, reducing its cost base by 4% whilst hiring an additional 320 full time equivalent employees in the business. This resulted in a cost income ratio reduction of 5.5 points to 44.3%. Our focus on capital efficiency improved net revenue over RWA by 1.4 points to 6.9% in Germany, leading to a return on allocated capital of 16.1%, an increase of 5.2 points. Germany generated 98 basis points of \u20ac3 billion of capital organically this year. These results were propelled by our ongoing industrial transformation where we are investing in harmonizing and consolidating our training activities and technology. Banks were being an example of an enhancement to our digital offering. We have also made available 24 different onemarkets Funds in the country. Central Europe delivered excellent performance in the year with profit before tax up 62%, reaching a total of \u20ac2.2 billion. Net revenue reached \u20ac4.2 billion, increasing 27% with gross revenue up 24%. NII increased 25%. Fees remain flat, net of higher acquisition cost in the Czech Republic. Cost of risk reduced to 4 basis points. Costs remain broadly stable despite inflation and investment and cost-income ratio decreased by 8.8 points to 38.1%. Our disciplined approach on RWA continued across countries. Net revenue to RWA was up 1.4 points to 6.9%. ROAC reached 21%, up 6.7 points. Central Europe generated 62 basis points, or \u20ac1.9 billion of capital organically this year. In addition to strong financial results, we are progressively rolling out 23 onemarket Funds in Austria, 16 in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia. And we are proud to have issued the inaugural green mortgage-covered bond in the Czech Republic and led the third series of green bonds on the Budapest Stock Exchange. Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe confirmed its consistent profitability and demonstrated its role as a major growth engine for the group, with profit before tax almost doubling to reach \u20ac1.7 billion. Net revenue was up 48% to \u20ac2.7 billion, with gross revenue increasing 30%. This was driven by NII up 47%, fees up 3.8%, and a net reversal of LLPs with negative cost of risk of minus 22 basis points. Cost-income ratio decreased by 8 points to 32.9%. Costs increased by 4.9%, substantially below inflation. Our approach towards capital excellence moved net revenue to RWA up 3.1 points to 9.6%. ROAC increased 17.7 points to 36.9%. Eastern Europe generated 39 basis points, or \u20ac1.2 billion of capital organically this year. The region is continuing its industrial transformation to support its present and future financial performance. We introduced an end-to-end digital process on overdraft and credit cards, as well as a voicebot in Croatia, to better serve our clients quickly and efficiently. Our retail offering was revamped in Romania, resulting in a market share increase of approximately 80 basis points year-over-year. We also began to exploit the synergies resulting from the merger with Alfa Bank. Our onemarket Fund offering is already available in Bulgaria, with 16 funds, and soon to be launched in Romania. These actions led us to be awarded as the best bank in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Croatia, and best mobile bank app in Bosnia Mostar. 2023 was not a standalone achievement, but rather the result of a three-year journey. I will now briefly guide you through the factors that underpin and sustain our outstanding performance. At the core of our journey lies our unique vision and winning strategy, underpinned by our industrial transformation, all guided by our shared principles and values. Three years ago, UniCredit was falling short when it came to serving its clients. A siloed model, burdened by bureaucracy, with a corporate center that had lost its focus on the client. We have redefined our operating model, putting clients back at the center of the bank's strategy and operation, to unlock our inherent potential and deliver value for all our stakeholders. We are rebuilding UniCredit block by block, that will result in long-term, sustainable, profitable growth. We are empowering and unifying our team through a common vision and a clear culture, promoting ownership, accountability and learning from mistakes. We are all parts, working in lockstep, with our purpose and values as the lynchpin. We are simplifying and delayering, creating a leaner, faster and efficient structure that cultivates empowerment within a clear framework. We are rationalizing and strengthening our partnership and our approach to procurement, leveraging group scale and bargaining power to build long-lasting relationships with our suppliers. We continue to invest in our people on the front line, distribution channels, products and in our franchise, with full value yet to be realized. We are modernizing and enhancing our digital and data capabilities, taking back control of core competencies, streamlining and enhancing our digital organization and standardizing and modernizing our technology. As a result, UniCredit has gone from laggard to leader, both in terms of its model and its financial performance. Since the unveiling of UniCredit Unlocked, we have adapted to a changing environment to deliver unmatched value to our stakeholders, consistently over the last three years. Our financials have been excellent, with our 2023 return on tangible equity and net profit increasing respectively over 3x and 2.6x versus the 2017-19 average. We have generated over \u20ac27 billion of capital organically in the 2021-23 period, supporting a total distribution of \u20ac17.6 billion above our initial market cap, while substantially increasing our CT1 ratio. Our 2023 EPS, DPS, and tangible book per share are up 3.1x, 9x, and 46% respectively, versus the average of 17-19. Our total shareholder returns have exceeded the peer group 3.5x over the last three years, whilst we have continued to build lines of defence and invest for the future. While the future is still uncertain and the challenge is significant, there is still meaningful value to be unlocked and we face the future with confidence. Looking to the future, 2024 is a normalization year. We should absorb most or all of the headwinds facing us by further improving the quality of our earnings, our operation and capital efficiency and risk-taking, while greatly rewarding the investors willing to embark with us on the next phase of our journey. We expect NII to face headwinds as deposit pass-through continues to increase. We stand firm on profitability rather than volumes, and continue to scale down Russia, with an impact estimated at \u20ac300 million, partly upset by circa \u20ac400 million positive impact from our replicating portfolio. Our cost of risk should increase from an all-time low of 12 basis points, but still remain below 20 basis points. We expect fees to grow by a few hundred million, thanks to our investment and more favourable environment. Trading should normalize, also in light of the assumed euro zone rate reduction during 2024, all resulting in net revenue of around \u20ac22.5 billion, based on our underlying assumption. The continued scaling down of Russia should account for roughly half of the gap with 2023. We will drive our costs down further. This is while absorbing the effect of inflation and contract renegotiation through the exit financed by our integration costs, and supported by continued streamlining and simplification. Our non-operating items deserve a special mention, as they shall significantly reduce due to the integration costs that total \u20ac1.1 billion in 2023, trending to zero, and systemic charges reducing by more than \u20ac200 million. As such, we expect net profit to remain broadly in line with 2023 level, with improved P&L quality. Return on tangible equity at circa 16.5%, and organic capital generation to exceed 300 basis points, all underpinning sustained distribution pre-NE capital usage. We are aiming for double-digit growth in our EPS and DPS. We intend to reward investors who embark with us on the next phase of our journey with circa \u20ac10 billion 2024 calendar year distributions. The sum of \u20ac7.2 billion of remaining 2023 distribution, after the 1.4 billion share buyback already executed in 2022, and the introduction of an interim distribution of around 40% of our expected 2024 distribution to be executed in the fourth quarter or in October. Around \u20ac4.3 billion will be in cash, leading to a dividend yield of approximately 10%, an expected DPS growth of more than 2.5 times, and around 5.8 billion share buyback, more than 20% higher than last year, a total distribution yield above 20%. Looking beyond 2024, the second phase of UniCredit Unlocked entails the continuation of our vision, of our strategy, driving further achievements. We have transformed ourselves and as such are comfortable committing to continuing to do so to deliver significant value, quality and predictability over the long-term. We are uniquely positioned to continue outperforming, delivering sustainable, outstanding profitability and distribution in 2024 and beyond. We face the future with optimism. We have anticipated the main expected headwinds and taken steps to address them. Our profitability is underpinned by targeted, proactive action that will pay dividends. In the face of pressure on NII, we are maintaining our focus on quality, not volume. With our fee-to-revenue now aligned with top-tier peers and set to grow further. We have substantial P&L buffers and provision, a high-quality credit portfolio with low non-performing exposure coupled with overlays of \u20ac1.8 billion, \u20ac1.1 billion in integration costs trending to zero, and a reduction of over \u20ac200 million in systemic charges. The above supports us in an uncertain macro with changing rate dynamics, coupled with a best-in-class capital generation, they enable us to maintain our bottom-line profitability and outsize distribution without denting capital, which however remain well in excess of our target and shall be used going forward. Finally, we sit on a bolted balance sheet with strong asset quality, low and stable cost of risk, leading CT1 ratio and healthy liquidity ratio. When we look at our trajectory and performance over the last three years, peculiarities emerge regarding how the market perceives us. We are less dependent on interest rates than sometimes assumed. Our NII growth is aligned with our European peer group average. We benefited less versus Italian peer due to our geographic diversification and an approach based on profitability rather than volume. We are much more fee-driven than people perceive and are among the top-tier banks in terms of fee-to-revenues. We have a diversified fee base with future potential from recent investment, including an additional \u20ac1.4 billion in fees at run rate from our best-in-class product factories. It is worth noting that a significant portion of this fee growth is locked in. It is not dependent on market dynamics, rather a function of ongoing managerial actions linked to internalization of value chain in asset management, internalization of life insurance, renegotiation of main supplier contracts across value chain and action in payment and advisory and capital markets. These slides present the details of UniCredit fee growth consistent with the information shown in the Q3 results presentation. As such, I won't spend time discussing it now as I have already done so at Q3. Before I open for questions, I would leave you with five key takeaways. Firstly, we have delivered outstanding profitability, significantly up year-on-year, well above expectations. Secondly, our capital generation and distribution continue to be best-in-class. Thirdly, EPS, DPS and tangible book value per share growth are unparalleled, underpinned by continued progress across our three financial levers, coupled with substantial share buyback. Fourth, Phase 1 of UniCredit Unlocked is effectively completed one year in advance, beating all KPIs, resulting in a transformed bank. The foundations for Phase 2 are set and rooted in the same philosophy. And finally, we have a clear direction of travel. In 2024, we expect to normalize 2023 record profitability, improve the quality of our earnings, while delivering record calendar year distribution of circa \u20ac10 billion, and continue to grow EPS and DPS significantly. Thank you, and I'll now open for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Antonio Reale, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAntonio Reale: Good morning, everyone. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions for me, please. The first one on the outlook for capital distribution and the second one on your guidance for this year, perhaps with a focus on NII. So starting with the first one, if I think back when UniCredit first launched a buyback program about three years ago, that came with a signaling effect of sort of balance sheet strength, suggesting the cleanup and the restructuring journey had been completed. Today, nobody seems to give much attention to balance sheet strength, and it's all about sustainability of earnings. Now, you're lifting dividend payouts to 40% with a commitment to pay at least 90% of earnings before 81 in cash, which is a welcome change in the definition. What makes you comfortable that this can be sustained and why do you think this is the right mix of capital distribution? That's my first one. The second is to do with your four-year guidance, specifically on NII. I mean, you're guiding to be broadly in line to this year, also in 2024, so close to \u20ac8.6 billion. That consensus has some catching up to do. Slide 20, I think you provide quite a bit of qualitative color on the key drivers. Can we talk about this in more detail, please, and particularly on the outlook for NII in 2024, and if possible, your assumptions or your early thoughts about 2025? You're less sensitive than Italian crystal rates, so it would be great to understand the moving parts on NII from here. Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: Okay, I'll take the first question, and Stefano will take the second one, and we'll integrate each other. So, on distributions, what we have done this year is two things. One, we have aligned to new EB8 guidelines that require everybody to express distribution as a percentage of net income. And we are saying that going forward, we commit to distribute an amount of net profit or net income which is equal or in excess of 90%. We have put, because we continue to believe that what drives our distribution is organic capital generation, not net profit. We continue to put a cap on the overall distributions at 100% of organic capital generation. So, it acts as a cap to, for the time being, keep us honest at that level. By definition, if we do that, we are recurrent, we are sustainable, because it means that year-after-year, what we distribute is what we can afford, and we do not use the excess capital on the ordinary to fund the distribution. That does not mean we will not distribute the excess capital. It just means that in the ordinary distribution we are talking about here, we're not including the excess capital. The second thing is we have had a relatively low payout ratio in terms of dividends in the past few years, at 35% of net profit post 81 in cashes. And we have done so, one, because we wanted to be absolutely certain that our transformation was bolted, and secondly, because we considered our shares to be such a good bargain for us to buy back. As we move forward, and as a number of investors have highlighted that they would like an improvement in our cash yield, we've done two things. One, we're now calculating the payout before 81 in cashes. That has a significant impact. And secondly, we are increasing our payout to 40%. That does not mean that we will not increase it further, but at the moment, that's the number. In addition to that, and that's the third point, as we are now at a significant level of distribution, we are smoothing the distribution by considering an interim distribution in October that will be equal to 40% of the distribution anticipated the following year. And therefore, as the year in which this happens, the total distribution in the calendar year will be circa, or depending on how we do, in excess of \u20ac10 billion, of which a significant portion in cash.\nStefano Porro: So, net interest income, let's start from 2024. So, key assumptions. Rates, assumption of average rates of 2024 equal to 2023. We are assuming an ECB rate cut between May and June. The starting point of the arrival is around 3.9. We're expecting that in Q4, the arrival will be below 3%. With regards, the net interest income sensitivity connected to rates, as highlighted by Andrea, is lower than the previous quarter, so every 25 basis points is \u20ac140 million. We are expecting a further reduction of the sensitivity during the course of 2024. One of the important elements to be considered is that we have increased the size of the replicating portfolio. So, we move from around a little bit more than \u20ac170 billion during Q4, 2022, to around \u20ac190 billion at the end of the year. So, this has increased the contribution to the margin of the replicating portfolio, but has also reduced the net interest income sensitivity. Second assumption is deposit pass-through, i.e., the ratio between the client rate and the average interbank rate. We closed around 25% for the full year of 2024. The average of Q4 was around 28%. We're assuming that the pass-through will go up during the course of the year, especially in the second half, when the rates will go down. The average that we're assuming is around 30%, so you can look at 23, average 25, 24, the average is 30%. As also highlighted by Andrea, the net interest income sensitivity deriving from deposit pass-through is around \u20ac130 million, coherent with the assumption that I told you in terms of rates. What about GDP? GDP that we're assuming in the footprint is below 1. That's a very important element to consider the expected growth of the lending. We're expecting still a lending stock reduction in Italy, also in Germany, differently from Central and Eastern Europe where we're expecting a growth. This is one of the elements that will change during the course of 2025, when the GDP growth that we're expecting is around 1.5, with also some positive implication on the lending growth. For 2024, the key drivers are the two that I mentioned. Average rate the same, deposit pass-through going up, replicating portfolio contribution \u20ac400 million, and as highlighted already in the speech by Andrea, a reduction of the contribution by Russia for around \u20ac300 million. We're not expecting meaningful impact deriving from the volumes and client spread trend. On top of GDP, improvement in 2025 is fair to be assumed that the average rate in 2025 will be lower clearly than the average of 2024. You have the sensitivity, but please do consider that, as I told you before, we are expecting that net interest income sensitivity can be lower at the end of 2024 in comparison to the beginning of the year.\nAntonio Reale: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrea Filtri, Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Filtri: Thank you. You have led the way for the entire sector on share buybacks, and now you're doing it on total distribution. Now you have essentially hinted at a potential gradual increase in cash payouts. You have introduced interim, and you still have a very thick excess capital buffer. Do you think the journey on this front has ended? Are you at run rate, and are you comfortable with these levels with the change of the guard at the regulator? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: Okay, so I think we're very comfortable with the distribution that we have. So from day one, we insisted that what drives distribution is capital generation. Fundamentally, very simply, what capital do you have at the beginning of the year? What capital do you have at the end of the year? And if you have an excess and you distribute that, then you're sustainable, you're current. Of course, there is a period in which that capital generation is significantly in excess in the profitability, and then the net income. Then there is a phase where it converges to net income, and then at some point there will be a phase where it will be less than net income. UniCredit has been in the phase in the last three years where capital generation has been significantly in excess to net income. As a result, notwithstanding distributing \u20ac17.6 billion to our shareholders, we increase our excess capital very materially. So if you look at the trend and you look at our expectation going forward, we're saying in excess of 300 business points on a profitability of broadly in line, which is about 8.6. So there is a beginning of convergence of the organic capital generation to the net profit, which we think will remain above over the next three years, but we will see what happens. But we think it will remain above. So allowing us to peg very strongly on net profit, our distribution, and we said equal or above to 90% to be, let's say, realistic or conservative with respect to where we are moving. Then there is the question of where we will be at trend line. Well, if you go beyond three years, although I don't have a crystal ball, hopefully we will have even greater profitability. The organic capital generation will be close to net income but below, but because net income will be higher, we will be able to distribute similarly to what we distribute now. And I don't know exact landing because we need to look at that. When we look at the composition of what we're distributing, in the composition of what we're distributing, we've had shareholders that were very vocal on at this price by your shares. And we've had also shareholders would say, okay, but as you're trending towards stabilization or normalization, increase your payout because we want more dividend yield. So we are responding to those shareholders by slightly increasing our payout. But it is clear, and I have said in other calls, that we will continue to increase the payout at some point, and 35 or now 40% is not the end game. We cannot be a bank that prides itself on generating through profitability outsized distribution and remaining with an under-peer payout ratio. So over time, we will progressively increase that percentage. Now, I'll speak what is over time. It will be judged based on our share price evolution, are we stabilizing, are we normalizing, a lot of factors in there. But we're committed to increase it over time. Then you see the interim. Given the amount of distribution that we're doing, both in terms of dividend payout, but remember, we're still majority share buyback, we need to spread. Because otherwise, we create a situation where we're too concentrated on one part of a year and indeed in terms of dividend on one date, which is not the best thing in our opinion. Which is why we introduce the interim dividend by spreading the number over two parts of a year. Finally, I think that with respect to our view, with respect to where we're going, we absolutely are comfortable that this direction of travel and the way we're stating it is consistent with regulatory expectations. And going forward, the only question mark that remains, that as I said, I will clarify after the AGM, because it's a commitment for the following three years and I don't want to anticipate anything, is what we will do with the excess capital. If you ask me, now on an individual basis, that excess capital needs to be used. And it will be used either by complementing the distributions on an extraordinary basis, so we will have the ordinary number that we have just discussed, plus an underpin of excess capital return to our shareholders over a certain period of time. Or used in acquisition, if the terms and conditions, in particular pricing, leads us to be able to demonstrate to investors that as we focus on value, that acquisition fulfills that objective and benchmarks correctly with buying back our own shares. So far, we have not been able to do that, but I don't exclude that that is possible in the future.\nAndrea Filtri: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Britta Schmidt with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nBritta Schmidt: Yes, thank you for taking my questions. Could you perhaps just comment on the fee and insurance side? I think you slightly upped the 1.4 billion benefits now from 1.2 billion previously. Can you give us a bit of an update of some of the statuses where on the payment strategy and also what timing are you thinking about for the restructuring of the asset management? My second question will be on the expected loss and overlay usage. Where really do you see now your structural cost of risk in the longer term? And how and when do you expect to use the 1.8 billion overlays? And just as a clarification, just on Stefanos' comments on the deposit costs, does that mean that the deposit costs at year-end 2024 are going to be lower than the 1.2% in Q4 2023? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: Okay, let me take the first part and then Stefano will come after me. So, first of all, the philosophy question, what do we do with overlays or with the excess provision we have created vis-\u00e0-vis benchmark? Well, it's a question of where we see the cycle. So, the overlays and the excess provision are there to protect us against the cycle or if our expectation and the expectation of the industry on the cycle are less negative to then be released as we should and therefore propel further our results. So, we have capacity in there. When are we going to do that? Well, if you tell me when the back end of a cycle arrives in terms of risk, I will tell you when I will release them. At the moment, our anticipation, which may be right or wrong, is that we are going to see an increase in cost of risk gradually more visible in the second part of the year and in particular starting Q4, getting into 2025. Why? Just because you will have had the time on the rate increase, on all the challenges, the geopolitics to go through our clients and potentially you're going to see some increase in cost of risk. We are more optimistic than I think some are, but we are prepared for the worst. So, assuming that in Q4 we see an increase and then it will continue in 2025, we have this 1.8 billion plus excess provision we have on a specific basis to make sure we deliver on the commitment we took to keep our cost of risk between 20 and 25. If the cycle is not like that, two things can happen. One, you see nothing at the end of 2024 and 2025, I doubt it, or you see much less. In any case, we are going to be obliged to release these overlays. Those overlays are there for specific reasons. They are not there to stay there. And therefore, in that case, our results and our cost of risk will trend significantly below the 20 to 25 as we release. So, that's in general how we look at it. In general, on life insurance, and then I'll pass it on to Stefano, and on asset management, the strategy is still the same? On insurance, we were clear on two things. One, we would rationalize our partners and heavily tilt towards alliance. We've done exactly that. Secondly, we would internalize life insurance, which for us is unit linked primarily, if and when the Danish compromise was confirmed. It was. So, sometimes in 2025, we will internalize the life insurance unit linked as per contract by buying the insurance company that we share with one of our partners and concentrating there most of our unit linked and life insurance. That will have an impact on our rate income that Stefano can take you through. Nothing has changed. The only thing that is changing more and more positively is that our progress on non-life insurance, in particularly ex-CPI, and in particularly in Italy, has been very, very positive. And we have converted quickly, and as you see, the volumes are going up very quickly, and we have a market share of new business in the mid-teens, which is quite good for us. And on asset management, I think it's not a restructuring. As for many other things, it's a progressive improvement. It's an improvement that we started by improving the way we set our asset allocation, that we provide strategies that are consistent to that for our clients, that we improve the design, the selections, and use our bargaining power to buy products at a better price. And that allows us \u2013 we used to have a rough cut of making \u20ac1 on the value chain. We used to maintain low 60% of the value chain in-house. We've moved that over the last three years to low 70%, and we think we can get to low 80% in-house by doing what we have just said. When I tell you that one market is getting rolled out in all of these countries, this is part of our grabbing the value chain to a greater extent for UniCredit. And this is a gradual movement that will continue to occur, and that has nothing to do with the market. If the market then bounces because of rates, that's on top. But this is what we're doing on our own value chain.\nStefano Porro: So, in relation to numbers, insurance. So, the insurance base for -- revenue base for this year, let's say, is around \u20ac900 million. The expected growth in terms of a run rate that we are aiming at is around \u20ac400 million. The growth is arriving from on one end, re-insourcing a part of the chain, but also to increase the revenues that are coming from the long life, both in relation to CPI and in relation to property and casualties. So, the expectation is to have a double-digit growth in relation to both in the next three years. In relation to payments, the base is clearly higher, so it's around a couple of billion. The growth that we are expecting is around \u20ac300 million. In relation, let's say, the two categories where we are also expecting a CAGR that is around 10% are cards and acquiring. With regards to overlays, we have slightly increased the overlays at year-end. We have slightly changed the composition of the overlays. Overall amount is 1.8. We need to use or to release in the next couple of years. What we cannot anticipate now is, let's say, how and when, if we look 2024, 2025, but in this couple of years, we don't believe there is another option, rather than releasing or utilizing if the overall evolution of the credit portfolio is worse than what we are currently expecting. With regards to the deposit cost, at the end of 2024, I would differentiate between the different countries, because we have a different composition of site and term deposit depending on each country. So, the average of the group is 75% site, but if you look, for example, to Italy, we are at 95% site. In general, we are expecting that if the rate dynamic is in line with our assumption, we will have a progressive reduction of the cost in the country where we have term deposits. While, for example, in countries where we have mainly site deposit, I believe this is unlikely. So, in relation to Italy, we believe that this is unlikely. We are not expecting a meaningful increase of the cost of the deposit, but a reduction is not very likely.\nAndrea Orcel: Britta, let me add one thing, because I may not have addressed the full question. If you look on that slide that I didn't comment, the impact that we expect from fees, in Q3, we were talking about \u20ac1.2 billion at run rate. We have increased that to \u20ac1.4 billion at run rate. The \u20ac200 million difference is partially rounding, partially spread all over, but mostly driven by payments. As we said, we will give you an update on that at the end of Q1, but the payment side of the equation will be approached in exactly the same way, block by block of the value chain, as we have approached asset management and insurance, and we are going to go to payment and do the same thing. As we do that, we should have, one, the benefit from higher focus than the market, but also the mechanical impact of potentially internalizing more, streamlining more, or doing other things in this direction.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Hallam with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChris Hallam: Morning, everyone. Just two quick ones from me. First, on efficiencies, you managed to reduce costs by about 1% in Q3. That was when inflation was high, and you talked earlier about the underlying 13% drop excluding inflation. How should we think about the size of the cost savings or cost reduction we should expect to see this year, especially in light of the \u20ac1.1 billion of integration costs you took in 2023? And then second, on volumes, as Stephanie mentioned earlier, the GDP outlook, but just what's driving the overall guidance for lower volumes year-over-year? How much of that is discipline on pricing and returns as opposed to overall market activity levels? And then, when would you expect to see volume growth coming back?\nAndrea Orcel: On cost, a few things just not to induce you in error. The first thing is, with the exception of Central and Eastern Europe, but in particular Eastern Europe, but Central and Eastern Europe, most of the effect of inflation are backdated or at the tail. So, the impact of inflation for the Italian contract renegotiation is in 2024, is not in 2023. And many other contracts go in the same direction. So, the integration costs that we're taking are going to compensate the real effect in inflation that we anticipate in 2024 and 2025, not in 2023. What happened in 2023 was taken care of by the integration costs and what we did in 2021 and 2022, and so on and so forth. So, there is some lag. So, while, yes, we took 1.1 billion in integration costs, it's also true that most of the inflation impact on the Western European, let's say, employee base is in 2024 and 2025, not in 2022 and 2023. Okay? So, that's point number one. Point number two, costs are not only people. Costs are also non-people, and we still are at run rate on what we invest in technology, on what we invest in the build-up of our factories, on distribution channel integration, on hiring at the front end, as we shift people from the center to commercial activities and we streamline. So, while the, let's call it HR cost is declining, the non-HR cost is increasing, and it should, because we are investing in digital as we go forward. So, if you look at all of that and you pull it all together, I think this organization has delivered very good performance on cost by trending down every year between 21, 22, and 23, in spite of maintaining investment. And just to remind you, as we said that we were trending down a few percentage point, but that number becomes 13% if you eliminate the investment in technology, in new people, in the factories, etcetera, etcetera. These investments are continuing. We're not relenting from that. So, I think that if this organization is able to take the cost in 2024 slightly lower than 2023, and as I said in another call in Q3, our ambition is to match or slightly overcome what we had in UniCredit Unlocked without all of this inflation when we started, and keep it there for, let's say, a couple of years. While we continue to invest in technology, in our front end, in refurbishing of our network, in new channels, in hiring, etcetera, etcetera, I think that's a good outcome, and I think you should bank that, not more. I think the only thing, and then I'll pass it to Stefano. Look, I think at the moment, as you see, our real underlying return on equity, so our ROAC, is you can call it 20.5 or more if you take away the integration cost. But when we look at the deployment of our capital, we're not deploying our capital at 20% and above. We're deploying our capital, or the bar that we put, is at our cost of equity. Our cost of equity is 11% to 12%, the real one. So, if we have an 11% to 12% assumed return from the deployment of our capital, we do it, and if we do not, we do not. And I think that that discipline pays dividend in the long-term because that's what drives long-term profitability and distribution. Otherwise, it could drive volume, show you a nice dynamic on NII, probably a nice dynamic on net profit, a much less positive dynamic on profitability and on distributions. So, we will continue in that direction. Obviously, when we look at clients, we look at clients. We don't look at lending. We look at the entire relationship. So, if you're a client sitting in our legacy portfolio and you've been there for years, and your returns are below our cost of equity, and we give you one last chance to align, if a client is not aligning, that's structural. And I think it is correct for us to gradually, orderly, de-emphasize that relationship. If instead, it's a new relationship, or it's a client that is aligning to our cost of equity or exceeding it, we will invest in the client and we will do it. But again, not a 20% return at 11. But I'll pass it to Stefano for more details.\nStefano Porro: Okay. So, I will take it first on cost. So, HR cost. Let's look to the key variables. So, the average FTEs, if we look at 2023, in comparison to the beginning of the year, are down for more than 5%. So, and just a couple of percentage points, if you look at Q4. The expectation is that we will have a further reduction, but at a slower pace. Solid drift is [Indiscernible]. The full impact of the Austrian contract was already there in 2023, fundamentally, but not the Italian one. And so, as a consequence of that, the solid drift increase in 2024 will be higher than 2023. With regards to non-HR cost, we will see an increased level of IT cost, on one end. But on the other end, in comparison to 2023, we are expecting a reduction in the real estate cost. That will include action on the footprint, but also the energy-related cost that we are expecting to be lower in 2024, in comparison to 2023. On volumes, fundamentally, there are three components. Rates and GDP. Rates are high, and as a consequence of that, there is an impact on the demand. So, this will be there also during the course of at least the first half of this year. Then there is the GDP. I told you before, there is a differentiation. So, GDP of Italy and Germany, expectation is lower than 1. But then, if you look, Central Europe, it will be above 1. And Eastern Europe, it will be above 2. So, this is why also the expectation in terms of lending trend is differentiated by country. The third topic, as already highlighted by Andrea, is the pricing. We do see pricing competition in many geographies, also by cooperative banks and so on. Considering that we go for profitable and quality growth, there is also part of the expectation that is depending from our strategy. This is especially on the corporate side. So, this is impacting a portion of, let's say, the lending, especially on the corporate side. With regards to inflation, the inflation expectation for 2024, maybe that is an important driver. Because on our footprint, the inflation in 2023 was around 7%. In 2024, we are expecting to have 3%. This is not automatically translating in cost drift. The salary drift is impacted by what we will negotiate. Just to remind that the renegotiation for German contract is expected in the second part of 2024. So, not before this moment.\nOperator: The next question is from Pamela Zuluaga with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.\nPamela Zuluaga: Hello, good morning. Thank you very much. I want to ask you about your push for fees. Life insurance has suffered in Italy from a shift in the savings flows into BTP. What does this imply for your expectations on life growth now that you are planning on internalizing? Do you think this is a trend that will reverse soon? Maybe now with potential rate cuts? Then, within the asset management fees, you are mostly a distributor of collective investment products. You say you want to optimize the value you retain from your distribution agreements. But, for example, your agreement with Amundi is still in force, I think, until 2027. So, should we expect a big part of this value retention strategy to materialize with some sort of delay? And if I may, as a follow-up. So, the guidance for the 90% payout on flat net profit next year implies that distribution will be at least \u20ac7.7 billion against 2024 earnings. When you talk about the sustainability of this payout, would you also expect a sustainability of this sort of absolute amount? In the case the distribution cap of organic capital generation falls below net profit before the three years that you were mentioning, are you willing to use excess capital to top it up? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: Okay, let me start with a second one because it's more straightforward. The answer is yes and yes. So, fundamentally, we have done a lot of work on what we can do in the next three years. We feel that the current levels of profitability are sustainable, plus minus, obviously, plus minus. With those levels of profitability and those levels of net income, and most importantly, organic capital generation at the levels that we are anticipating, let's say at least \u20ac7.7 billion is sustainable as an ordinary level of distribution. Like any other organization, if our profitability starts dropping or organic capital generation starts dropping, it will go down. But that happens to anyone. If you ask me where I see going in the next three years, I think \u20ac7.7 billion is sustainable. As a minimum. Now, in addition to that, you said what about excess capital? It is clear that when you look at your distribution, you should be looking at two things. One is the profitability sustainable. I think with the lines of defense and the investments we have, it is. Secondly, what happens if you miss? Everybody can miss. Well, we have a ton of excess capital, and at that point, we would chip in. And if we chip in, obviously, we can sustain it. Consider one thing, that if we were to deploy some of that excess capital acquiring something, the share count will be non-changing because we are using excess capital. We are not issuing new shares, but the net income would go up because we are buying net income effectively. So, it is another way of creating more generation of our distribution going forward. That is how we are looking at it. The second thing is, and I will let Stefano add. So, with respect to life insurance or unit linked, yes, they suffered because of flows into BTPs. But at the same time, like the rest of asset management, they should come back. They should come back when rates normalize and things normalize. In general, given the levels at which we can buy back our joint ventures, we are comfortable that they add value even at the current level of flows. With respect to Amundi, Amundi does not provide all of our asset management. We have a substantial portion, 20%, 30%, depending, that is in inverted commas \u201cfree\u201d. Most of the value that we are creating on the value chain is focusing on that 20% 30% today. Beyond, we will see. We will see about our agreement with Amundi, etcetera. But I don't think it is an all or nothing between now and 2027. It is a progressive, with 2027 obviously being an important year as one of our key agreements is up for renegotiation.\nStefano Porro: Just to add on the life insurance, on the time horizon, we are not expecting a reverse when there will be the rate cut. We are expecting an improvement of the trend when the rates will normalize, i.e. not for 2024 but more for 2025.\nPamela Zuluaga: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Delphine Lee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDelphine Lee: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a few ones, a couple of ones. On net interest income, can I just ask this? I think before you were guiding to NII to decline moderately, you don't specify moderately and there is no precise guidance now. I am just kind of wondering, looking at your comments on the replicating portfolio or Russia, it seems that actually NII could still be resilient. I just wanted to have a bit more comment on that. Also, if you could just clarify on your rate sensitivity, the \u20ac150 million for 25 years, what is the assumption you are making on deposit beta? Then my second question is more broadly on excess capital and M&A because now you are doing more than \u20ac6 billion of buyback per annum. I am just wondering, is the excess capital still based on a 13% CT1 level? How much capacity is there really for exceptional buybacks? Or do you feel like there is more pressure now to go the M&A route? Thank you.\nStefano Porro: On net interest income, we have not guided with specific numbers also because we have given you all the key ingredients. In relation to the ingredients, coming back to the ingredients, fundamentally, on one hand there is Russia, which is very important because the more we are reducing the exposure and we are scaling down Russia, the more we have an impact on net interest income, is \u20ac300 million. This is one very important component. The second element is the deposit pass-through that we already commented before. Then I will arrive then to the sensitivity. The third one is the replicating portfolio. The replicating portfolio is there, is impacting. The contribution to the net interest income in 2024 has allowed around \u20ac400 million more compared to 2023. It has also reduced the net interest income sensitivity because increasing the stock of the replicating portfolio over time has also reduced our net interest income sensitivity. The sensitivity to rates moved from 150 to 140 and is coherent with the deposit beta that we have allotted. The deposit beta is in Q4 around 28% while the average for the year in terms of expectation is around 30%.\nAndrea Orcel: With respect to share buybacks, yes, we take 12.5 to 13 as our target. It is the same target we had put in our plan of unique rate unlocked. It has not changed. Secondly, obviously, there is an impact from Balfour in 2025. That impact for us is about 80, 85 basis points which will reduce that excess at least nominally if we remain at 12.5%, 13% target. You can calculate what it is after that. Now, is there more pressure on M&A? I would put it differently. There is less pressure on M&A given the results that we can continue to deliver internally but potentially there will be more opportunity if the divergence between results of winners and losers in the industry becomes more marked.\nDelphine Lee: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Azzurra Guelfi with Citi. Please go ahead. Guelfi, we cannot hear you. Maybe your line is on mute. Guelfi, we still cannot hear you. Maybe your line is muted. The next question is from Hugo Cruz, KBW. Please go ahead.\nHugo Cruz: Hi, thank you very much for the time. I wanted to ask just two things. One was RWA optimization. If you could quantify how much you still have to do or how much you think you can do during 2024. And then a more broad question. Mr. Orcel, if it depended just on you, when would you like to leave your current role at UniCredit? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: I'm just -- okay. So, RWA optimization, I will pass to Stefano on the numbers. But I think as we told you at the beginning, at the moment we're generating capital through two levers. Profitability, so net profit minus the cost of the business. Minus the capital we use to generate it. That capital, as we become more and more efficient on our revenue per RWA, decreases per unit of profit we generate. Obviously, the more fees and the more. And we go back to the question before. We deploy capital above our cost of equity. The more capital we generate per unit of net profit. And the second part, which is more transitory. The, let's say, rendering efficient, managing the legacy portfolio. So, what we have, the 430 billion of portfolio that we have bringing it as much as possible above the cost of equity. That will always be there. But obviously, not even close to the amount that we have done in these three years. Gradually, it's coming off. So, we cannot generate 400 business points of capital on 12 billion of capital on 8.6 billion of net profit forever. I wish it was like that, but it's not. So, gradually, it's coming off. And so, I do think that in 2024, it's going to still be. So, the contribution from that brings us above net profit in 2024, in terms of organic capital generation. We feel that that will happen also in 2025. And potentially in 2026, but we need to see. We will become, and are becoming more and more over time, in inverted commas, \u201cnet profit\u201d dependent. But, as we increase that net profit, and we increase the efficiency of our capital deployment with more fees, and more deployed above the cost of equity, the amount of distribution that we can distribute from that net profit continues to rise. And so, we hope that at the end, you almost won't see a change, because our net profit will be higher, and the percentage of net profit we distribute in distribution will be almost a continuation of where we would have landed you in the years prior to that. But, it's a gradual course. If you wish, if we were to apply the same methodology to our targets or to our acquisition, or whatever, we then replenish what we're trying to do. But, for the time being, there is a finite life, and beyond that, Hugo, it's difficult. I would love. So, with respect to the question, I would say, it's up to shareholder and more broadly stakeholders. But, I love the place here, and we're doing exceptionally well with a team that has given a lot, and therefore, I am fully committed.\nStefano Porro: So, some data points more on active portfolio management, and risk-based optimization. During 2023, we have done, if you look, securitization, active portfolio management, including all the activity on EVA negative clients, is more than 10 billion. If you look at our corporate portfolio at group level, the amount of EVA negative, let's say, is around 20 billion. It's clear that we will not do securitization, or not rolling over opposition of the amount, but still, we have some billions that we believe we can optimize during the course of both 2024 and 2025.\nHugo Cruz: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Marco Nicolai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nMarco Nicolai: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I've got two. One on costs. So, your headcount continues to shrink at a good pace, and given the restructuring costs you booked in 4Q, there is further room to go. So, I was wondering, what is driving these cuts? Is it more branches, rationalization? Is it head office? Is it IT investment benefits, or something else? And the second question is on, again, NII. So, on Russia, I appreciate your guide for headwind in 2024, about 300 million less. However, if I look at the fourth quarter, NII was actually up Q-on-Q. So, how shall we think about Q-on-Q evolution on the Russian side? Thanks a lot.\nAndrea Orcel: So, I'll take the cost, because the costs are completely connected to what we said since day one. This organization was highly centralized, and the level of center, non-business cost, administration, bureaucracy, call it whichever way you want to call it, was far exceeding what I think was the levels of average peers, and I still believe organization needs to go further. So, what we have done is embark in efficiencies that are very targeted. This is not a socialized efficiency. This is efficiency that attacks the area one by one, whereby redesigning processes. Take one that I used the first day I came here. We used to have in one of our countries 23 people to sign off on a mortgage. If we go to an end-to-end process, we don't need 23 people to sign off on a mortgage. So, when we talk about organization streamlining, delaying, process redesign, change of way of working, what we're talking about is going into the mechanics or the industrial of every process, the way we do business, the way we sign off business, etcetera, rethinking it, redesigning it, making it more efficient, improving the speed, and reducing the cost of doing it. That part does not touch the front, does not touch the factories, does not touch digital. Actually, it does touch digital in one way, and I will explain to you how. That part effectively not only reduces cost and increases speed, but also releases a lot of energy because the people who are doing anything, something, i.e., in commercial, have a lot less weight to carry on their shoulders and can take decision and can move much quicker. So, that's where we have targeted. So, if I take your list, head office, absolutely, IT, I would say, not the IT you think. We used to have more than 50% of our IT organization that had non-engineering software developer coding roles. In best-in-class organization, that number is below 20%. So, we have taken away that, so the layers, or are taking away that, and are reinvesting in the one that matters to transform our organization, which is software engineers, etcetera, etcetera. That applies to the entire organization. So, we're taking away and shrinking the bureaucracy to what is needed, and invest in hiring or technology or any other thing that we need to make our business more efficient. So, it's a targeted cost reduction to finance the rest. As you can imagine, at some point, we reach the end. We're not at the end yet, but that's where we're going.\nStefano Porro: Russia, Q4, top line, impacted by the positive effect deriving from the sale of a cross-border position. That's on one, positive impact on the revenue. Second, net interest income trend impacted by the effects trend. So, we need to look at that with a pinch of salt, because when there is, let's say, a rubble appreciation, you should also take that into consideration. So, if you look at cost and effects, the expectation is that the net interest income will be lower already in Q1, 24, in comparison to Q4, 23.\nAndrea Orcel: Just to be clear, Marco, we always said that we were conservative in our provisioning for Russia. So, obviously, if we're conservative in our provision and we sell a cross-border position well within our metrics or well within provision, we actually create a gain. But you need to take that away to look at the trend line of the underlying in Russia.\nMarco Nicolai: Yes, okay. Thanks a lot. That's very clear.\nOperator: So, gentlemen that was the last question. And the floor is back to the management for any closing remarks.\nAndrea Orcel: So, thank you everyone for your time. And thank you for staying with us. And we'll see you all later. Thank you. Bye-bye.",

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we will walk you through what you have achieved thanks to our UniCredit Unlocked plan, our goals and our outlook for 2024. I have always stated that my ambition is to build a bank that is strongly grounded in the right principles and values, one that delivers long-term quality growth and value for all our stakeholders, our shareholders, our employees, our clients and our communities. As we report our 12th consecutive quarter of quality profitable growth across all regions, I can proudly say that in these last three years we have fulfilled this ambition. For our shareholders, we delivered quality growth, operational and capital excellence, sustainable profitability, capital generation and distributions, all underpinned by strong capitalization, liquidity and asset quality. For our employees, we have focused on providing a motivating vision, a rewarding and merit-based environment, a culture to which they identify and ultimately pride in what we are achieving. And for our clients and community, they are at the heart of everything we do. We have improved the quality of service and support we provide, offering best-in-class product through diversified, integrated and strengthened channels. This commitment to delivering and pursuing excellence has been our guiding principle and driven all that we have done so far and it will continue to be our focus as we move ahead. UniCredit had its best year ever in 2023, the culmination of a three-year journey which delivered for the present while transforming our bank and preparing for the future. We will review our past accomplishments and look ahead to 2024 and beyond, where our sights are set on new heights. This is the year we grew our net profit to \u20ac8.6 billion, up 54% while continuing to invest in the future and expensing \u20ac1.1 billion of integration costs. Without these, our net profit would have been \u20ac9.5 billion. We delivered a record return on tangible equity of 16.6%, 5.8 points higher than last year, or 20.5% with a CT1 ratio of 13% adjusting for our notable excess capital. Fourth quarter was much better than expected, with net profit up 19% despite higher integration costs to secure our future. Without them, net profit would have been up 37%. We generated \u20ac12 billion in capital organically this year, underpinning our proposed distribution of \u20ac8.6 billion, or 100% of net profit, \u20ac3 billion dividend and \u20ac5.5 billion share buyback, while reinforcing our CT1 ratio by 100 basis points to 15.9%. Following new EBA rules, we adjusted Q4 CT1 and will continue to adjust going forward as we accrue distribution, both cash and share buyback. Our cumulative past three years distribution exceeds \u20ac17.5 billion, more than our market cap at the beginning of 2021. At the same time, we increased CT1 by circa \u20ac10 billion in the period. Our per share growth continues to be industry leading, with EPS up 74%, DPS 80%, and tangible book per share up 17% this year. The quality of such growth is underscored by the progress on our three financial levers and a 12% reduction in share count over the year, 30% reduction since the beginning of 2021. In 2024, we aim to maintain net profit broadly in line with 2023 record level, normalizing our best year ever while further improving the quality of our results across the P&L, delivering double digit growth in EPS and DPS. We expect the tailwind from interest rates and cost of risk to gradually fade. The impact from continuing to scale down Russia while our fees, which have grown to represent 32% of our revenues, should further increase their weight. As we work to deliver these results, we will reward our shareholders with outside calendar year distribution of approximately \u20ac10 billion. We consider 2024 the start of a second phase of UniCredit Unlocked, rooted in the same vision, the same strategy and mostly the same levers as we continue our transformation. We will defend our profitability and the leadership achieved in operational and capital efficiency as well as cost of risk. We will strive to further improve the quality of our results, continuing to deploy our capital profitably while growing our capital-light businesses. We shall strive to sustain best-in-class distribution while strengthening our bank and continue to deliver value for investors through substantial earnings and dividend per share growth. Let me now take you through UniCredit's best year ever, a testament to our commitment to excellence and our ability to adapt to changing market conditions. 2023 has been an exceptional year for UniCredit, with a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter in which we took the opportunity to absorb even more integration costs than anticipated. Our key metrics highlight the outstanding performance across our three financial levers. Net revenue increased 26% to \u20ac23.2 billion, with gross revenue up 17%. We have continued to improve our operational efficiency, reducing costs by 1% to \u20ac9.47 billion, while absorbing inflation and investment. Our cost-income ratio has further dropped by 7.2 percentage points to 39.7% for the year. Similarly, we have continued to improve our capital efficiency, with RWA decreasing 2% to \u20ac284.5 billion, with net revenue to RWAs reaching 7.9% up 2.1 points. We reached a record return on tangible equity of 16.6%, notwithstanding \u20ac1.1 billion of integration costs and a significant capital buffer. Indeed, our underlying return on tangible equity at 13% CT1 ratio reached 20.5%, 22.4% if we excluded integration costs. All these lead to \u20ac12 billion or 389 basis points of organic capital generation, underpinning our proposed increased distribution of \u20ac8.6 billion or 100% of 2023 net profit. Let me now take you through the main item of our P&L in greater detail. We report a significant increase in net revenues, growing 26% year-over-year. This was driven by excellent net interest income and resilient fees, while our cost of risk remained significantly lower than our guidance of 20 to 25 basis points through the cycle. Our trading revenues continue to show resiliency and stability as primarily driven by client business. Our NII grew 31% year-over-year and was sequentially flat in the quarter, driven by rates rising 218 basis points on average in the year and 21 basis points in the quarter across our footprint, coupled by strict pass-through management, which reached 28% in Q4 and averaged at 25% in the full year. We continue our focus on quality risk adjusted, simplified EVA positive origination, profitable and capital efficient client business rather than value-destroying volumes, which together with subdued loan demand led to client volume dropping \u20ac8.5 billion in the quarter. The rise in customer deposit rates was small with clients continuing to shift their savings into assets under custody products. However, our already strong liquidity position improved, with LCR increasing to above 145% and loans to deposit ratio decreasing to 86%. Our NII sensitivity is updated to \u20ac130 million per percentage point change of deposit beta and \u20ac140 million per 25 basis points change of the ECB deposit facility rate. We view NII and cost of risk as intimately linked, both in the way that we look at our numbers and the way we manage our franchise and our KPIs. These numbers demonstrate what we have said quarter after quarter. We have a robust and high-quality credit portfolio at \u20ac428 billion with a low default rate, a very meaningful reduction of NPE to \u20ac11.7 billion with improved quality mix and coverage, as well as a lower expected loss on new business, confirming our vigilant approach towards new origination. The last 12 quarters show a structurally lower and less volatile underlying cost of risk net of overlays in Russia, at an average of 16 basis points and always below 22, versus approximately 60 basis points on average from 17 to 19. This transform and strong asset quality underpins our 2023 cost of risk of 12 basis points, 28 basis points in the quarter as we took the opportunity to further build up our market-leading overlays and provision to protect or further propel our future results. We have and will continue to make substantial progress in our fee line. Notwithstanding consistent macro headwinds, we have grown our fees each and every year since 2021. We've compounded annual growth rate of 2% from 2021 to 2023 once we exclude the impact from current account fees and accelerated securitization cost. In 2023, fees grew 1% excluding \u20ac180 million reduction in current account fees in Italy to the benefit of our clients and higher securitization costs. Today, UniCredit fee structure is well diversified. It is balanced with a top tier fee to revenue ratio of 32.3%. Full potential from past and future investment as the impact from internalization is yet to be realized. Despite inflation across our geographic footprint and investment in our people, franchise and technology, we have been able to reduce cost 3% in a targeted fashion between 2021 and 2023. Growth of such investment and inflation, our costs would have dropped 13%. The fourth quarter of 2023 saw [Indiscernible] flat year-on-year in spite of a significant increase in our bonus pool. This is evidence in our commitment to paying for performance and recognition of the hard work of our people. Our focus on profitable capital deployment led to a net revenue to risk-weighted asset ratio increase to 7.9% in 2023, up from 5% in 2021. We generated 389 business points of capital organically in 2023, or \u20ac12 billion, well above our net profit, leveraging our quality focus and excellent portfolio management with proactive RWA management. Risk-weighted assets stood at circa \u20ac285 billion, down almost \u20ac25 billion in the year. In 2023, UniCredit CT1 ratio increased almost 100 business points from 14.91% to 15.89%, showing our ability to distribute capital whilst continuing to substantially strengthen our capitalization. Over the last three years, our CT1 ratio has grown despite absorbing business requirements and substantial regulatory headwinds and returning \u20ac17.6 billion to our shareholders. Let me now outline our results through the prism of our business, starting with client solutions. Our factories generated \u20ac9.9 billion in 2023, of which fees accounted for 64%. This is a 1% rise from the previous year if we leave out Russia, which we continue to scale down, showing the steady performance of our banks, backed by our factories in spite of challenging market conditions. Corporate solutions brought in a revenue of \u20ac4.9 billion, a decline of 6% from the previous year, mainly due to the cutback of the Russian business and TLTRO, without which we would have been flat. Within corporate solutions, advisory and capital markets were up 11% and trade and correspondent banking 5%, as they both continue to leverage our unique footprint. Deals of note include the Eurogroup, L'Automatica, [ph] Ferretti IPOs and Upower [ph] Leverage Buyout. Payments increased 12% driven by NII growth, boosted by our better leveraging of our European presence and recent investment in the business. Please remember that 90% of payments revenues are fee driven. Individual solutions still face a difficult macro environment leading to a 4% drop. However, we see positive signs in the growth of managed funds and especially in non-CPI protection, which was up 40% year-on-year. Our Italian business delivered another quarter of outstanding results. \u20ac5.6 billion of profit before tax, up 29% year-over-year. Net revenue reached \u20ac10.5 billion, up 19% with gross revenues aligned. Net interest income grew 50% whilst fees were almost flat when excluding current account fee reduction done for the benefit of our clients and securitization cost. Cost of risk remained low at 22 basis points, stable at 19 basis points in the quarter. Cost decreased by 1.8% leading to a cost income ratio of 35.8%, and down 7.8 points year-on-year, with continued focus on shrinking non-business activities and optimizing processes also through technology. Our focus on capital efficiency improved net revenue to RWA by 2.5 points to 9.3% in Italy, with an increase of ROAC by 8.5 points to 25.7%. Italy generated 168 basis points of \u20ac5.2 billion of capital organically this year. Significant progress has been made industrially. We launched 28 one market funds. We hired over 600 people while shrinking non-business staff by 700. We provided 1.2 million hours of training through UniCredit University to our staff. Finally, we continue to invest in our distribution channel, including by refurbishing our branches and launching buddy R-Evolution. We have remained steadfast in our commitment to supporting individuals, households and businesses investing \u20ac10 billion euros through UniCredit per l'Italia. All these efforts have been recognized with UniCredit being named Bank of the Year Italy 2023 by the banker. Our German franchise achieved its best result in over a decade, reaching profit before tax of \u20ac2.1 billion up 18% year-over-year. Net revenue reached \u20ac5.3 billion, increasing 13% with gross revenue up 8%. NII was up 4% and fees 1%. Cost of risk of 14 basis points was down 16 basis points versus 2022. Germany showcased operating efficiency, reducing its cost base by 4% whilst hiring an additional 320 full time equivalent employees in the business. This resulted in a cost income ratio reduction of 5.5 points to 44.3%. Our focus on capital efficiency improved net revenue over RWA by 1.4 points to 6.9% in Germany, leading to a return on allocated capital of 16.1%, an increase of 5.2 points. Germany generated 98 basis points of \u20ac3 billion of capital organically this year. These results were propelled by our ongoing industrial transformation where we are investing in harmonizing and consolidating our training activities and technology. Banks were being an example of an enhancement to our digital offering. We have also made available 24 different onemarkets Funds in the country. Central Europe delivered excellent performance in the year with profit before tax up 62%, reaching a total of \u20ac2.2 billion. Net revenue reached \u20ac4.2 billion, increasing 27% with gross revenue up 24%. NII increased 25%. Fees remain flat, net of higher acquisition cost in the Czech Republic. Cost of risk reduced to 4 basis points. Costs remain broadly stable despite inflation and investment and cost-income ratio decreased by 8.8 points to 38.1%. Our disciplined approach on RWA continued across countries. Net revenue to RWA was up 1.4 points to 6.9%. ROAC reached 21%, up 6.7 points. Central Europe generated 62 basis points, or \u20ac1.9 billion of capital organically this year. In addition to strong financial results, we are progressively rolling out 23 onemarket Funds in Austria, 16 in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia. And we are proud to have issued the inaugural green mortgage-covered bond in the Czech Republic and led the third series of green bonds on the Budapest Stock Exchange. Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe confirmed its consistent profitability and demonstrated its role as a major growth engine for the group, with profit before tax almost doubling to reach \u20ac1.7 billion. Net revenue was up 48% to \u20ac2.7 billion, with gross revenue increasing 30%. This was driven by NII up 47%, fees up 3.8%, and a net reversal of LLPs with negative cost of risk of minus 22 basis points. Cost-income ratio decreased by 8 points to 32.9%. Costs increased by 4.9%, substantially below inflation. Our approach towards capital excellence moved net revenue to RWA up 3.1 points to 9.6%. ROAC increased 17.7 points to 36.9%. Eastern Europe generated 39 basis points, or \u20ac1.2 billion of capital organically this year. The region is continuing its industrial transformation to support its present and future financial performance. We introduced an end-to-end digital process on overdraft and credit cards, as well as a voicebot in Croatia, to better serve our clients quickly and efficiently. Our retail offering was revamped in Romania, resulting in a market share increase of approximately 80 basis points year-over-year. We also began to exploit the synergies resulting from the merger with Alfa Bank. Our onemarket Fund offering is already available in Bulgaria, with 16 funds, and soon to be launched in Romania. These actions led us to be awarded as the best bank in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Croatia, and best mobile bank app in Bosnia Mostar. 2023 was not a standalone achievement, but rather the result of a three-year journey. I will now briefly guide you through the factors that underpin and sustain our outstanding performance. At the core of our journey lies our unique vision and winning strategy, underpinned by our industrial transformation, all guided by our shared principles and values. Three years ago, UniCredit was falling short when it came to serving its clients. A siloed model, burdened by bureaucracy, with a corporate center that had lost its focus on the client. We have redefined our operating model, putting clients back at the center of the bank's strategy and operation, to unlock our inherent potential and deliver value for all our stakeholders. We are rebuilding UniCredit block by block, that will result in long-term, sustainable, profitable growth. We are empowering and unifying our team through a common vision and a clear culture, promoting ownership, accountability and learning from mistakes. We are all parts, working in lockstep, with our purpose and values as the lynchpin. We are simplifying and delayering, creating a leaner, faster and efficient structure that cultivates empowerment within a clear framework. We are rationalizing and strengthening our partnership and our approach to procurement, leveraging group scale and bargaining power to build long-lasting relationships with our suppliers. We continue to invest in our people on the front line, distribution channels, products and in our franchise, with full value yet to be realized. We are modernizing and enhancing our digital and data capabilities, taking back control of core competencies, streamlining and enhancing our digital organization and standardizing and modernizing our technology. As a result, UniCredit has gone from laggard to leader, both in terms of its model and its financial performance. Since the unveiling of UniCredit Unlocked, we have adapted to a changing environment to deliver unmatched value to our stakeholders, consistently over the last three years. Our financials have been excellent, with our 2023 return on tangible equity and net profit increasing respectively over 3x and 2.6x versus the 2017-19 average. We have generated over \u20ac27 billion of capital organically in the 2021-23 period, supporting a total distribution of \u20ac17.6 billion above our initial market cap, while substantially increasing our CT1 ratio. Our 2023 EPS, DPS, and tangible book per share are up 3.1x, 9x, and 46% respectively, versus the average of 17-19. Our total shareholder returns have exceeded the peer group 3.5x over the last three years, whilst we have continued to build lines of defence and invest for the future. While the future is still uncertain and the challenge is significant, there is still meaningful value to be unlocked and we face the future with confidence. Looking to the future, 2024 is a normalization year. We should absorb most or all of the headwinds facing us by further improving the quality of our earnings, our operation and capital efficiency and risk-taking, while greatly rewarding the investors willing to embark with us on the next phase of our journey. We expect NII to face headwinds as deposit pass-through continues to increase. We stand firm on profitability rather than volumes, and continue to scale down Russia, with an impact estimated at \u20ac300 million, partly upset by circa \u20ac400 million positive impact from our replicating portfolio. Our cost of risk should increase from an all-time low of 12 basis points, but still remain below 20 basis points. We expect fees to grow by a few hundred million, thanks to our investment and more favourable environment. Trading should normalize, also in light of the assumed euro zone rate reduction during 2024, all resulting in net revenue of around \u20ac22.5 billion, based on our underlying assumption. The continued scaling down of Russia should account for roughly half of the gap with 2023. We will drive our costs down further. This is while absorbing the effect of inflation and contract renegotiation through the exit financed by our integration costs, and supported by continued streamlining and simplification. Our non-operating items deserve a special mention, as they shall significantly reduce due to the integration costs that total \u20ac1.1 billion in 2023, trending to zero, and systemic charges reducing by more than \u20ac200 million. As such, we expect net profit to remain broadly in line with 2023 level, with improved P&L quality. Return on tangible equity at circa 16.5%, and organic capital generation to exceed 300 basis points, all underpinning sustained distribution pre-NE capital usage. We are aiming for double-digit growth in our EPS and DPS. We intend to reward investors who embark with us on the next phase of our journey with circa \u20ac10 billion 2024 calendar year distributions. The sum of \u20ac7.2 billion of remaining 2023 distribution, after the 1.4 billion share buyback already executed in 2022, and the introduction of an interim distribution of around 40% of our expected 2024 distribution to be executed in the fourth quarter or in October. Around \u20ac4.3 billion will be in cash, leading to a dividend yield of approximately 10%, an expected DPS growth of more than 2.5 times, and around 5.8 billion share buyback, more than 20% higher than last year, a total distribution yield above 20%. Looking beyond 2024, the second phase of UniCredit Unlocked entails the continuation of our vision, of our strategy, driving further achievements. We have transformed ourselves and as such are comfortable committing to continuing to do so to deliver significant value, quality and predictability over the long-term. We are uniquely positioned to continue outperforming, delivering sustainable, outstanding profitability and distribution in 2024 and beyond. We face the future with optimism. We have anticipated the main expected headwinds and taken steps to address them. Our profitability is underpinned by targeted, proactive action that will pay dividends. In the face of pressure on NII, we are maintaining our focus on quality, not volume. With our fee-to-revenue now aligned with top-tier peers and set to grow further. We have substantial P&L buffers and provision, a high-quality credit portfolio with low non-performing exposure coupled with overlays of \u20ac1.8 billion, \u20ac1.1 billion in integration costs trending to zero, and a reduction of over \u20ac200 million in systemic charges. The above supports us in an uncertain macro with changing rate dynamics, coupled with a best-in-class capital generation, they enable us to maintain our bottom-line profitability and outsize distribution without denting capital, which however remain well in excess of our target and shall be used going forward. Finally, we sit on a bolted balance sheet with strong asset quality, low and stable cost of risk, leading CT1 ratio and healthy liquidity ratio. When we look at our trajectory and performance over the last three years, peculiarities emerge regarding how the market perceives us. We are less dependent on interest rates than sometimes assumed. Our NII growth is aligned with our European peer group average. We benefited less versus Italian peer due to our geographic diversification and an approach based on profitability rather than volume. We are much more fee-driven than people perceive and are among the top-tier banks in terms of fee-to-revenues. We have a diversified fee base with future potential from recent investment, including an additional \u20ac1.4 billion in fees at run rate from our best-in-class product factories. It is worth noting that a significant portion of this fee growth is locked in. It is not dependent on market dynamics, rather a function of ongoing managerial actions linked to internalization of value chain in asset management, internalization of life insurance, renegotiation of main supplier contracts across value chain and action in payment and advisory and capital markets. These slides present the details of UniCredit fee growth consistent with the information shown in the Q3 results presentation. As such, I won't spend time discussing it now as I have already done so at Q3. Before I open for questions, I would leave you with five key takeaways. Firstly, we have delivered outstanding profitability, significantly up year-on-year, well above expectations. Secondly, our capital generation and distribution continue to be best-in-class. Thirdly, EPS, DPS and tangible book value per share growth are unparalleled, underpinned by continued progress across our three financial levers, coupled with substantial share buyback. Fourth, Phase 1 of UniCredit Unlocked is effectively completed one year in advance, beating all KPIs, resulting in a transformed bank. The foundations for Phase 2 are set and rooted in the same philosophy. And finally, we have a clear direction of travel. In 2024, we expect to normalize 2023 record profitability, improve the quality of our earnings, while delivering record calendar year distribution of circa \u20ac10 billion, and continue to grow EPS and DPS significantly. Thank you, and I'll now open for questions."

        "text": "Good morning, everyone. It's Antonio from Bank of America. Two questions for me, please. The first one on the outlook for capital distribution and the second one on your guidance for this year, perhaps with a focus on NII. So starting with the first one, if I think back when UniCredit first launched a buyback program about three years ago, that came with a signaling effect of sort of balance sheet strength, suggesting the cleanup and the restructuring journey had been completed. Today, nobody seems to give much attention to balance sheet strength, and it's all about sustainability of earnings. Now, you're lifting dividend payouts to 40% with a commitment to pay at least 90% of earnings before 81 in cash, which is a welcome change in the definition. What makes you comfortable that this can be sustained and why do you think this is the right mix of capital distribution? That's my first one. The second is to do with your four-year guidance, specifically on NII. I mean, you're guiding to be broadly in line to this year, also in 2024, so close to \u20ac8.6 billion. That consensus has some catching up to do. Slide 20, I think you provide quite a bit of qualitative color on the key drivers. Can we talk about this in more detail, please, and particularly on the outlook for NII in 2024, and if possible, your assumptions or your early thoughts about 2025? You're less sensitive than Italian crystal rates, so it would be great to understand the moving parts on NII from here. Thank you."

        "text": "Okay, I'll take the first question, and Stefano will take the second one, and we'll integrate each other. So, on distributions, what we have done this year is two things. One, we have aligned to new EB8 guidelines that require everybody to express distribution as a percentage of net income. And we are saying that going forward, we commit to distribute an amount of net profit or net income which is equal or in excess of 90%. We have put, because we continue to believe that what drives our distribution is organic capital generation, not net profit. We continue to put a cap on the overall distributions at 100% of organic capital generation. So, it acts as a cap to, for the time being, keep us honest at that level. By definition, if we do that, we are recurrent, we are sustainable, because it means that year-after-year, what we distribute is what we can afford, and we do not use the excess capital on the ordinary to fund the distribution. That does not mean we will not distribute the excess capital. It just means that in the ordinary distribution we are talking about here, we're not including the excess capital. The second thing is we have had a relatively low payout ratio in terms of dividends in the past few years, at 35% of net profit post 81 in cashes. And we have done so, one, because we wanted to be absolutely certain that our transformation was bolted, and secondly, because we considered our shares to be such a good bargain for us to buy back. As we move forward, and as a number of investors have highlighted that they would like an improvement in our cash yield, we've done two things. One, we're now calculating the payout before 81 in cashes. That has a significant impact. And secondly, we are increasing our payout to 40%. That does not mean that we will not increase it further, but at the moment, that's the number. In addition to that, and that's the third point, as we are now at a significant level of distribution, we are smoothing the distribution by considering an interim distribution in October that will be equal to 40% of the distribution anticipated the following year. And therefore, as the year in which this happens, the total distribution in the calendar year will be circa, or depending on how we do, in excess of \u20ac10 billion, of which a significant portion in cash."

        "speaker": "Stefano Porro",
        "text": "So, net interest income, let's start from 2024. So, key assumptions. Rates, assumption of average rates of 2024 equal to 2023. We are assuming an ECB rate cut between May and June. The starting point of the arrival is around 3.9. We're expecting that in Q4, the arrival will be below 3%. With regards, the net interest income sensitivity connected to rates, as highlighted by Andrea, is lower than the previous quarter, so every 25 basis points is \u20ac140 million. We are expecting a further reduction of the sensitivity during the course of 2024. One of the important elements to be considered is that we have increased the size of the replicating portfolio. So, we move from around a little bit more than \u20ac170 billion during Q4, 2022, to around \u20ac190 billion at the end of the year. So, this has increased the contribution to the margin of the replicating portfolio, but has also reduced the net interest income sensitivity. Second assumption is deposit pass-through, i.e., the ratio between the client rate and the average interbank rate. We closed around 25% for the full year of 2024. The average of Q4 was around 28%. We're assuming that the pass-through will go up during the course of the year, especially in the second half, when the rates will go down. The average that we're assuming is around 30%, so you can look at 23, average 25, 24, the average is 30%. As also highlighted by Andrea, the net interest income sensitivity deriving from deposit pass-through is around \u20ac130 million, coherent with the assumption that I told you in terms of rates. What about GDP? GDP that we're assuming in the footprint is below 1. That's a very important element to consider the expected growth of the lending. We're expecting still a lending stock reduction in Italy, also in Germany, differently from Central and Eastern Europe where we're expecting a growth. This is one of the elements that will change during the course of 2025, when the GDP growth that we're expecting is around 1.5, with also some positive implication on the lending growth. For 2024, the key drivers are the two that I mentioned. Average rate the same, deposit pass-through going up, replicating portfolio contribution \u20ac400 million, and as highlighted already in the speech by Andrea, a reduction of the contribution by Russia for around \u20ac300 million. We're not expecting meaningful impact deriving from the volumes and client spread trend. On top of GDP, improvement in 2025 is fair to be assumed that the average rate in 2025 will be lower clearly than the average of 2024. You have the sensitivity, but please do consider that, as I told you before, we are expecting that net interest income sensitivity can be lower at the end of 2024 in comparison to the beginning of the year."

        "text": "Thank you. You have led the way for the entire sector on share buybacks, and now you're doing it on total distribution. Now you have essentially hinted at a potential gradual increase in cash payouts. You have introduced interim, and you still have a very thick excess capital buffer. Do you think the journey on this front has ended? Are you at run rate, and are you comfortable with these levels with the change of the guard at the regulator? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Okay, so I think we're very comfortable with the distribution that we have. So from day one, we insisted that what drives distribution is capital generation. Fundamentally, very simply, what capital do you have at the beginning of the year? What capital do you have at the end of the year? And if you have an excess and you distribute that, then you're sustainable, you're current. Of course, there is a period in which that capital generation is significantly in excess in the profitability, and then the net income. Then there is a phase where it converges to net income, and then at some point there will be a phase where it will be less than net income. UniCredit has been in the phase in the last three years where capital generation has been significantly in excess to net income. As a result, notwithstanding distributing \u20ac17.6 billion to our shareholders, we increase our excess capital very materially. So if you look at the trend and you look at our expectation going forward, we're saying in excess of 300 business points on a profitability of broadly in line, which is about 8.6. So there is a beginning of convergence of the organic capital generation to the net profit, which we think will remain above over the next three years, but we will see what happens. But we think it will remain above. So allowing us to peg very strongly on net profit, our distribution, and we said equal or above to 90% to be, let's say, realistic or conservative with respect to where we are moving. Then there is the question of where we will be at trend line. Well, if you go beyond three years, although I don't have a crystal ball, hopefully we will have even greater profitability. The organic capital generation will be close to net income but below, but because net income will be higher, we will be able to distribute similarly to what we distribute now. And I don't know exact landing because we need to look at that. When we look at the composition of what we're distributing, in the composition of what we're distributing, we've had shareholders that were very vocal on at this price by your shares. And we've had also shareholders would say, okay, but as you're trending towards stabilization or normalization, increase your payout because we want more dividend yield. So we are responding to those shareholders by slightly increasing our payout. But it is clear, and I have said in other calls, that we will continue to increase the payout at some point, and 35 or now 40% is not the end game. We cannot be a bank that prides itself on generating through profitability outsized distribution and remaining with an under-peer payout ratio. So over time, we will progressively increase that percentage. Now, I'll speak what is over time. It will be judged based on our share price evolution, are we stabilizing, are we normalizing, a lot of factors in there. But we're committed to increase it over time. Then you see the interim. Given the amount of distribution that we're doing, both in terms of dividend payout, but remember, we're still majority share buyback, we need to spread. Because otherwise, we create a situation where we're too concentrated on one part of a year and indeed in terms of dividend on one date, which is not the best thing in our opinion. Which is why we introduce the interim dividend by spreading the number over two parts of a year. Finally, I think that with respect to our view, with respect to where we're going, we absolutely are comfortable that this direction of travel and the way we're stating it is consistent with regulatory expectations. And going forward, the only question mark that remains, that as I said, I will clarify after the AGM, because it's a commitment for the following three years and I don't want to anticipate anything, is what we will do with the excess capital. If you ask me, now on an individual basis, that excess capital needs to be used. And it will be used either by complementing the distributions on an extraordinary basis, so we will have the ordinary number that we have just discussed, plus an underpin of excess capital return to our shareholders over a certain period of time. Or used in acquisition, if the terms and conditions, in particular pricing, leads us to be able to demonstrate to investors that as we focus on value, that acquisition fulfills that objective and benchmarks correctly with buying back our own shares. So far, we have not been able to do that, but I don't exclude that that is possible in the future."

        "text": "Yes, thank you for taking my questions. Could you perhaps just comment on the fee and insurance side? I think you slightly upped the 1.4 billion benefits now from 1.2 billion previously. Can you give us a bit of an update of some of the statuses where on the payment strategy and also what timing are you thinking about for the restructuring of the asset management? My second question will be on the expected loss and overlay usage. Where really do you see now your structural cost of risk in the longer term? And how and when do you expect to use the 1.8 billion overlays? And just as a clarification, just on Stefanos' comments on the deposit costs, does that mean that the deposit costs at year-end 2024 are going to be lower than the 1.2% in Q4 2023? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Okay, let me take the first part and then Stefano will come after me. So, first of all, the philosophy question, what do we do with overlays or with the excess provision we have created vis-\u00e0-vis benchmark? Well, it's a question of where we see the cycle. So, the overlays and the excess provision are there to protect us against the cycle or if our expectation and the expectation of the industry on the cycle are less negative to then be released as we should and therefore propel further our results. So, we have capacity in there. When are we going to do that? Well, if you tell me when the back end of a cycle arrives in terms of risk, I will tell you when I will release them. At the moment, our anticipation, which may be right or wrong, is that we are going to see an increase in cost of risk gradually more visible in the second part of the year and in particular starting Q4, getting into 2025. Why? Just because you will have had the time on the rate increase, on all the challenges, the geopolitics to go through our clients and potentially you're going to see some increase in cost of risk. We are more optimistic than I think some are, but we are prepared for the worst. So, assuming that in Q4 we see an increase and then it will continue in 2025, we have this 1.8 billion plus excess provision we have on a specific basis to make sure we deliver on the commitment we took to keep our cost of risk between 20 and 25. If the cycle is not like that, two things can happen. One, you see nothing at the end of 2024 and 2025, I doubt it, or you see much less. In any case, we are going to be obliged to release these overlays. Those overlays are there for specific reasons. They are not there to stay there. And therefore, in that case, our results and our cost of risk will trend significantly below the 20 to 25 as we release. So, that's in general how we look at it. In general, on life insurance, and then I'll pass it on to Stefano, and on asset management, the strategy is still the same? On insurance, we were clear on two things. One, we would rationalize our partners and heavily tilt towards alliance. We've done exactly that. Secondly, we would internalize life insurance, which for us is unit linked primarily, if and when the Danish compromise was confirmed. It was. So, sometimes in 2025, we will internalize the life insurance unit linked as per contract by buying the insurance company that we share with one of our partners and concentrating there most of our unit linked and life insurance. That will have an impact on our rate income that Stefano can take you through. Nothing has changed. The only thing that is changing more and more positively is that our progress on non-life insurance, in particularly ex-CPI, and in particularly in Italy, has been very, very positive. And we have converted quickly, and as you see, the volumes are going up very quickly, and we have a market share of new business in the mid-teens, which is quite good for us. And on asset management, I think it's not a restructuring. As for many other things, it's a progressive improvement. It's an improvement that we started by improving the way we set our asset allocation, that we provide strategies that are consistent to that for our clients, that we improve the design, the selections, and use our bargaining power to buy products at a better price. And that allows us \u2013 we used to have a rough cut of making \u20ac1 on the value chain. We used to maintain low 60% of the value chain in-house. We've moved that over the last three years to low 70%, and we think we can get to low 80% in-house by doing what we have just said. When I tell you that one market is getting rolled out in all of these countries, this is part of our grabbing the value chain to a greater extent for UniCredit. And this is a gradual movement that will continue to occur, and that has nothing to do with the market. If the market then bounces because of rates, that's on top. But this is what we're doing on our own value chain."

        "speaker": "Stefano Porro",
        "text": "So, in relation to numbers, insurance. So, the insurance base for -- revenue base for this year, let's say, is around \u20ac900 million. The expected growth in terms of a run rate that we are aiming at is around \u20ac400 million. The growth is arriving from on one end, re-insourcing a part of the chain, but also to increase the revenues that are coming from the long life, both in relation to CPI and in relation to property and casualties. So, the expectation is to have a double-digit growth in relation to both in the next three years. In relation to payments, the base is clearly higher, so it's around a couple of billion. The growth that we are expecting is around \u20ac300 million. In relation, let's say, the two categories where we are also expecting a CAGR that is around 10% are cards and acquiring. With regards to overlays, we have slightly increased the overlays at year-end. We have slightly changed the composition of the overlays. Overall amount is 1.8. We need to use or to release in the next couple of years. What we cannot anticipate now is, let's say, how and when, if we look 2024, 2025, but in this couple of years, we don't believe there is another option, rather than releasing or utilizing if the overall evolution of the credit portfolio is worse than what we are currently expecting. With regards to the deposit cost, at the end of 2024, I would differentiate between the different countries, because we have a different composition of site and term deposit depending on each country. So, the average of the group is 75% site, but if you look, for example, to Italy, we are at 95% site. In general, we are expecting that if the rate dynamic is in line with our assumption, we will have a progressive reduction of the cost in the country where we have term deposits. While, for example, in countries where we have mainly site deposit, I believe this is unlikely. So, in relation to Italy, we believe that this is unlikely. We are not expecting a meaningful increase of the cost of the deposit, but a reduction is not very likely."

If you look on that slide that I didn't comment, the impact that we expect from fees, in Q3, we were talking about \u20ac1.2 billion at run rate. We have increased that to \u20ac1.4 billion at run rate. The \u20ac200 million difference is partially rounding, partially spread all over, but mostly driven by payments. As we said, we will give you an update on that at the end of Q1, but the payment side of the equation will be approached in exactly the same way, block by block of the value chain, as we have approached asset management and insurance, and we are going to go to payment and do the same thing. As we do that, we should have, one, the benefit from higher focus than the market, but also the mechanical impact of potentially internalizing more, streamlining more, or doing other things in this direction."

        "text": "Morning, everyone. Just two quick ones from me. First, on efficiencies, you managed to reduce costs by about 1% in Q3. That was when inflation was high, and you talked earlier about the underlying 13% drop excluding inflation. How should we think about the size of the cost savings or cost reduction we should expect to see this year, especially in light of the \u20ac1.1 billion of integration costs you took in 2023? And then second, on volumes, as Stephanie mentioned earlier, the GDP outlook, but just what's driving the overall guidance for lower volumes year-over-year? How much of that is discipline on pricing and returns as opposed to overall market activity levels? And then, when would you expect to see volume growth coming back?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "On cost, a few things just not to induce you in error. The first thing is, with the exception of Central and Eastern Europe, but in particular Eastern Europe, but Central and Eastern Europe, most of the effect of inflation are backdated or at the tail. So, the impact of inflation for the Italian contract renegotiation is in 2024, is not in 2023. And many other contracts go in the same direction. So, the integration costs that we're taking are going to compensate the real effect in inflation that we anticipate in 2024 and 2025, not in 2023. What happened in 2023 was taken care of by the integration costs and what we did in 2021 and 2022, and so on and so forth. So, there is some lag. So, while, yes, we took 1.1 billion in integration costs, it's also true that most of the inflation impact on the Western European, let's say, employee base is in 2024 and 2025, not in 2022 and 2023. Okay? So, that's point number one. Point number two, costs are not only people. Costs are also non-people, and we still are at run rate on what we invest in technology, on what we invest in the build-up of our factories, on distribution channel integration, on hiring at the front end, as we shift people from the center to commercial activities and we streamline. So, while the, let's call it HR cost is declining, the non-HR cost is increasing, and it should, because we are investing in digital as we go forward. So, if you look at all of that and you pull it all together, I think this organization has delivered very good performance on cost by trending down every year between 21, 22, and 23, in spite of maintaining investment. And just to remind you, as we said that we were trending down a few percentage point, but that number becomes 13% if you eliminate the investment in technology, in new people, in the factories, etcetera, etcetera. These investments are continuing. We're not relenting from that. So, I think that if this organization is able to take the cost in 2024 slightly lower than 2023, and as I said in another call in Q3, our ambition is to match or slightly overcome what we had in UniCredit Unlocked without all of this inflation when we started, and keep it there for, let's say, a couple of years. While we continue to invest in technology, in our front end, in refurbishing of our network, in new channels, in hiring, etcetera, etcetera, I think that's a good outcome, and I think you should bank that, not more. I think the only thing, and then I'll pass it to Stefano. Look, I think at the moment, as you see, our real underlying return on equity, so our ROAC, is you can call it 20.5 or more if you take away the integration cost. But when we look at the deployment of our capital, we're not deploying our capital at 20% and above. We're deploying our capital, or the bar that we put, is at our cost of equity. Our cost of equity is 11% to 12%, the real one. So, if we have an 11% to 12% assumed return from the deployment of our capital, we do it, and if we do not, we do not. And I think that that discipline pays dividend in the long-term because that's what drives long-term profitability and distribution. Otherwise, it could drive volume, show you a nice dynamic on NII, probably a nice dynamic on net profit, a much less positive dynamic on profitability and on distributions. So, we will continue in that direction. Obviously, when we look at clients, we look at clients. We don't look at lending. We look at the entire relationship. So, if you're a client sitting in our legacy portfolio and you've been there for years, and your returns are below our cost of equity, and we give you one last chance to align, if a client is not aligning, that's structural. And I think it is correct for us to gradually, orderly, de-emphasize that relationship. If instead, it's a new relationship, or it's a client that is aligning to our cost of equity or exceeding it, we will invest in the client and we will do it. But again, not a 20% return at 11. But I'll pass it to Stefano for more details."

        "text": "Okay. So, I will take it first on cost. So, HR cost. Let's look to the key variables. So, the average FTEs, if we look at 2023, in comparison to the beginning of the year, are down for more than 5%. So, and just a couple of percentage points, if you look at Q4. The expectation is that we will have a further reduction, but at a slower pace. Solid drift is [Indiscernible]. The full impact of the Austrian contract was already there in 2023, fundamentally, but not the Italian one. And so, as a consequence of that, the solid drift increase in 2024 will be higher than 2023. With regards to non-HR cost, we will see an increased level of IT cost, on one end. But on the other end, in comparison to 2023, we are expecting a reduction in the real estate cost. That will include action on the footprint, but also the energy-related cost that we are expecting to be lower in 2024, in comparison to 2023. On volumes, fundamentally, there are three components. Rates and GDP. Rates are high, and as a consequence of that, there is an impact on the demand. So, this will be there also during the course of at least the first half of this year. Then there is the GDP. I told you before, there is a differentiation. So, GDP of Italy and Germany, expectation is lower than 1. But then, if you look, Central Europe, it will be above 1. And Eastern Europe, it will be above 2. So, this is why also the expectation in terms of lending trend is differentiated by country. The third topic, as already highlighted by Andrea, is the pricing. We do see pricing competition in many geographies, also by cooperative banks and so on. Considering that we go for profitable and quality growth, there is also part of the expectation that is depending from our strategy. This is especially on the corporate side. So, this is impacting a portion of, let's say, the lending, especially on the corporate side. With regards to inflation, the inflation expectation for 2024, maybe that is an important driver. Because on our footprint, the inflation in 2023 was around 7%. In 2024, we are expecting to have 3%. This is not automatically translating in cost drift. The salary drift is impacted by what we will negotiate. Just to remind that the renegotiation for German contract is expected in the second part of 2024. So, not before this moment."

        "text": "Hello, good morning. Thank you very much. I want to ask you about your push for fees. Life insurance has suffered in Italy from a shift in the savings flows into BTP. What does this imply for your expectations on life growth now that you are planning on internalizing? Do you think this is a trend that will reverse soon? Maybe now with potential rate cuts? Then, within the asset management fees, you are mostly a distributor of collective investment products. You say you want to optimize the value you retain from your distribution agreements. But, for example, your agreement with Amundi is still in force, I think, until 2027. So, should we expect a big part of this value retention strategy to materialize with some sort of delay? And if I may, as a follow-up. So, the guidance for the 90% payout on flat net profit next year implies that distribution will be at least \u20ac7.7 billion against 2024 earnings. When you talk about the sustainability of this payout, would you also expect a sustainability of this sort of absolute amount? In the case the distribution cap of organic capital generation falls below net profit before the three years that you were mentioning, are you willing to use excess capital to top it up? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Okay, let me start with a second one because it's more straightforward. The answer is yes and yes. So, fundamentally, we have done a lot of work on what we can do in the next three years. We feel that the current levels of profitability are sustainable, plus minus, obviously, plus minus. With those levels of profitability and those levels of net income, and most importantly, organic capital generation at the levels that we are anticipating, let's say at least \u20ac7.7 billion is sustainable as an ordinary level of distribution. Like any other organization, if our profitability starts dropping or organic capital generation starts dropping, it will go down. But that happens to anyone. If you ask me where I see going in the next three years, I think \u20ac7.7 billion is sustainable. As a minimum. Now, in addition to that, you said what about excess capital? It is clear that when you look at your distribution, you should be looking at two things. One is the profitability sustainable. I think with the lines of defense and the investments we have, it is. Secondly, what happens if you miss? Everybody can miss. Well, we have a ton of excess capital, and at that point, we would chip in. And if we chip in, obviously, we can sustain it. Consider one thing, that if we were to deploy some of that excess capital acquiring something, the share count will be non-changing because we are using excess capital. We are not issuing new shares, but the net income would go up because we are buying net income effectively. So, it is another way of creating more generation of our distribution going forward. That is how we are looking at it. The second thing is, and I will let Stefano add. So, with respect to life insurance or unit linked, yes, they suffered because of flows into BTPs. But at the same time, like the rest of asset management, they should come back. They should come back when rates normalize and things normalize. In general, given the levels at which we can buy back our joint ventures, we are comfortable that they add value even at the current level of flows. With respect to Amundi, Amundi does not provide all of our asset management. We have a substantial portion, 20%, 30%, depending, that is in inverted commas \u201cfree\u201d. Most of the value that we are creating on the value chain is focusing on that 20% 30% today. Beyond, we will see. We will see about our agreement with Amundi, etcetera. But I don't think it is an all or nothing between now and 2027. It is a progressive, with 2027 obviously being an important year as one of our key agreements is up for renegotiation."

        "text": "Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a few ones, a couple of ones. On net interest income, can I just ask this? I think before you were guiding to NII to decline moderately, you don't specify moderately and there is no precise guidance now. I am just kind of wondering, looking at your comments on the replicating portfolio or Russia, it seems that actually NII could still be resilient. I just wanted to have a bit more comment on that. Also, if you could just clarify on your rate sensitivity, the \u20ac150 million for 25 years, what is the assumption you are making on deposit beta? Then my second question is more broadly on excess capital and M&A because now you are doing more than \u20ac6 billion of buyback per annum. I am just wondering, is the excess capital still based on a 13% CT1 level? How much capacity is there really for exceptional buybacks? Or do you feel like there is more pressure now to go the M&A route? Thank you."

        "text": "On net interest income, we have not guided with specific numbers also because we have given you all the key ingredients. In relation to the ingredients, coming back to the ingredients, fundamentally, on one hand there is Russia, which is very important because the more we are reducing the exposure and we are scaling down Russia, the more we have an impact on net interest income, is \u20ac300 million. This is one very important component. The second element is the deposit pass-through that we already commented before. Then I will arrive then to the sensitivity. The third one is the replicating portfolio. The replicating portfolio is there, is impacting. The contribution to the net interest income in 2024 has allowed around \u20ac400 million more compared to 2023. It has also reduced the net interest income sensitivity because increasing the stock of the replicating portfolio over time has also reduced our net interest income sensitivity. The sensitivity to rates moved from 150 to 140 and is coherent with the deposit beta that we have allotted. The deposit beta is in Q4 around 28% while the average for the year in terms of expectation is around 30%."

Secondly, obviously, there is an impact from Balfour in 2025. That impact for us is about 80, 85 basis points which will reduce that excess at least nominally if we remain at 12.5%, 13% target. You can calculate what it is after that. Now, is there more pressure on M&A? I would put it differently. There is less pressure on M&A given the results that we can continue to deliver internally but potentially there will be more opportunity if the divergence between results of winners and losers in the industry becomes more marked."

Mr. Orcel, if it depended just on you, when would you like to leave your current role at UniCredit? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "I'm just -- okay. So, RWA optimization, I will pass to Stefano on the numbers. But I think as we told you at the beginning, at the moment we're generating capital through two levers. Profitability, so net profit minus the cost of the business. Minus the capital we use to generate it. That capital, as we become more and more efficient on our revenue per RWA, decreases per unit of profit we generate. Obviously, the more fees and the more. And we go back to the question before. We deploy capital above our cost of equity. The more capital we generate per unit of net profit. And the second part, which is more transitory. The, let's say, rendering efficient, managing the legacy portfolio. So, what we have, the 430 billion of portfolio that we have bringing it as much as possible above the cost of equity. That will always be there. But obviously, not even close to the amount that we have done in these three years. Gradually, it's coming off. So, we cannot generate 400 business points of capital on 12 billion of capital on 8.6 billion of net profit forever. I wish it was like that, but it's not. So, gradually, it's coming off. And so, I do think that in 2024, it's going to still be. So, the contribution from that brings us above net profit in 2024, in terms of organic capital generation. We feel that that will happen also in 2025. And potentially in 2026, but we need to see. We will become, and are becoming more and more over time, in inverted commas, \u201cnet profit\u201d dependent. But, as we increase that net profit, and we increase the efficiency of our capital deployment with more fees, and more deployed above the cost of equity, the amount of distribution that we can distribute from that net profit continues to rise. And so, we hope that at the end, you almost won't see a change, because our net profit will be higher, and the percentage of net profit we distribute in distribution will be almost a continuation of where we would have landed you in the years prior to that. But, it's a gradual course. If you wish, if we were to apply the same methodology to our targets or to our acquisition, or whatever, we then replenish what we're trying to do. But, for the time being, there is a finite life, and beyond that, Hugo, it's difficult. I would love. So, with respect to the question, I would say, it's up to shareholder and more broadly stakeholders. But, I love the place here, and we're doing exceptionally well with a team that has given a lot, and therefore, I am fully committed."

During 2023, we have done, if you look, securitization, active portfolio management, including all the activity on EVA negative clients, is more than 10 billion. If you look at our corporate portfolio at group level, the amount of EVA negative, let's say, is around 20 billion. It's clear that we will not do securitization, or not rolling over opposition of the amount, but still, we have some billions that we believe we can optimize during the course of both 2024 and 2025."

Is it more branches, rationalization? Is it head office? Is it IT investment benefits, or something else? And the second question is on, again, NII. So, on Russia, I appreciate your guide for headwind in 2024, about 300 million less. However, if I look at the fourth quarter, NII was actually up Q-on-Q.

        "text": "So, I'll take the cost, because the costs are completely connected to what we said since day one. This organization was highly centralized, and the level of center, non-business cost, administration, bureaucracy, call it whichever way you want to call it, was far exceeding what I think was the levels of average peers, and I still believe organization needs to go further. So, what we have done is embark in efficiencies that are very targeted. This is not a socialized efficiency. This is efficiency that attacks the area one by one, whereby redesigning processes. Take one that I used the first day I came here. We used to have in one of our countries 23 people to sign off on a mortgage. If we go to an end-to-end process, we don't need 23 people to sign off on a mortgage. So, when we talk about organization streamlining, delaying, process redesign, change of way of working, what we're talking about is going into the mechanics or the industrial of every process, the way we do business, the way we sign off business, etcetera, rethinking it, redesigning it, making it more efficient, improving the speed, and reducing the cost of doing it. That part does not touch the front, does not touch the factories, does not touch digital. Actually, it does touch digital in one way, and I will explain to you how. That part effectively not only reduces cost and increases speed, but also releases a lot of energy because the people who are doing anything, something, i.e., in commercial, have a lot less weight to carry on their shoulders and can take decision and can move much quicker. So, that's where we have targeted. So, if I take your list, head office, absolutely, IT, I would say, not the IT you think. We used to have more than 50% of our IT organization that had non-engineering software developer coding roles. In best-in-class organization, that number is below 20%. So, we have taken away that, so the layers, or are taking away that, and are reinvesting in the one that matters to transform our organization, which is software engineers, etcetera, etcetera. That applies to the entire organization. So, we're taking away and shrinking the bureaucracy to what is needed, and invest in hiring or technology or any other thing that we need to make our business more efficient. So, it's a targeted cost reduction to finance the rest. As you can imagine, at some point, we reach the end. We're not at the end yet, but that's where we're going."

    "transcript": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before I hand over to Magda Palczynska, Head of Investor Relations, a reminder that today's call is being recorded. Madam, you may begin.\nMagda Palczynska: Good morning, and welcome to UniCredit's First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. Andrea Orcel, our CEO, will take you through the results. This will be followed by a Q&A session with Andrea and Stefano Porro, our CFO. Please limit yourself to two questions. With that, I will hand over to Andrea.\nAndrea Orcel: Thank you, Magda. Good morning and thank you all for joining. Our Q1 \u201924 results are the embodiment of the continued hard work by those at UniCredit and our commitment to continuously pursue excellence. They underscore again, that UniCredit Unlocked is the right strategy as we build on our momentum, adapting and navigating the changing external environment to the benefit of all our stakeholders. We remain an attractive investment opportunity as our past performance and future prospects are still not reflected in our valuation. Both our price to earnings and price to distribution multiples remain at a substantial discount to both sector and top peers. Our commitment to excellence has resulted in our best first quarter ever and our 13th consecutive quarter of year-on-year profitable growth, setting new benchmarks in performance across all regions, product lines and metrics. This success is underpinned by resilient, profitable net NII, robust fee generation and improved operational and capital excellence with every region and business contributing to making a better whole. We have spent the last three years securing a position of industry leadership as we continue to outperform expectations and peers while building strong foundations of investments, capital, asset quality and liquidity to support our future. During the next three years, we remain committed to completing our UniCredit Unlocked transformation, further growing our results while delivering outsized returns. We will increase our focus on clients to counteract macro headwinds and further improve earnings quality. We will propel our top line by further expanding our fee base, crystallizing the investments and the work of the past three years while defending our unique high-quality net interest income net of loan loss provision that already exceed our cost of equity. All while striving to maintain our leadership in operational and capital efficiency. Finally, we will benefit from the gradual release of our extensive profit and loss buffers. We are confident in our ability to deliver our mid-term guidance of strong growth in EPS, DPS and tangible book value per share, return on tangible equity above 15% and overall distribution above 2023, thanks to our expected organic capital generation and excess capital return. For UniCredit, excellence means consistently delivering superior results, exceeding our strategic objectives and leading the industry across all KPIs. The mindset, this mindset, is our competitive advantage. Our growth is profitable, constantly outperforming expectation while investing and creating lines of defense for our future to ensure sustainability. Our outstanding performance is across all our three financial levers. Net revenues reached \u20ac6.3 billion, up 7.5% year-on-year; NII was up 9% with LLPs flat and low; fees up 3%, or 8% excluding current account fees, reduction in Italy and securitization costs. We have continued to improve our operational efficiency, reducing absolute cost by 1% to \u20ac2.3 billion while absorbing inflation and propelling investments. Our cost-to-income ratio improved further to 36.2%, three percentage point better than a year ago. Similarly, we have continued to improve our capital efficiency with net revenue to RWAs reaching 8.9%, up from 7.7% a year ago, with RWA's down \u20ac5 billion to \u20ac280 billion. All contributed to deliver a record return on tangible equity at 13% CET1 of 23%, up 2.6 percentage point year-on-year; a net profit of \u20ac2.6 billion, up 24% year-on-year; and an organic capital generation of \u20ac3.4 billion or 118 basis points, which allowed us to accrue \u20ac2.6 billion or 100% of our net profit in Q1 for distribution whilst increasing our CET1 ratio by 35 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 16.2%. These translate into an EPS up 42% year-on-year; a DPS up 64% year-on-year; and a tangible book value per share up 25% year-on-year. These results are built on strong foundation across leading capital levels, sound asset quality and strong liquidity ratio with LCR above 140% and NSFR above 125%. All regions and all product factories contributed to these results. Our net revenue is broken down into three categories, Net Interest Income net of LLPs, Fees and Trading & Others. Our focus on quality growth has resulted in structurally low loan loss provision and a net NII that continues to exceed our cost of equity. We believe to be only one of two banks who have achieved this. Our Fees have experienced strong and broad based growth leading to a top tier fee-to-revenue ratio, reflecting our investment in product factories over the last three years. Our Trading & Other revenue has been primarily driven by core client activity which has supported its resiliency. We recognize that NII net of provision plays an important role in our top line. We have successfully focused on keeping it above our cost of equity while laying the foundation for its profitable future growth. Gross NII and margins are slightly down quarter-on-quarter as rates have peaked and volumes have not recovered. This appears to be a better dynamic though than peers particularly given our focus on profitability rather than volume. Adjusting for the effects, NII was flat quarter-over-quarter. We successfully managed pass through to increase only two percentage point to 30% driven mainly by Germany and Central Europe. Deposit volume stabilized Q-on-Q with growth in Germany and Central Europe and Eastern Europe while Italy reflected some rotation to BTPs. As our approach of prioritizing profitable client segments grows over volumes, moderates overall NII growth, our risk adjusted NII net of LLP remained above our cost of equity and is up 5% quarter-over-quarter. This focus on quality growth will continue to sustain superior profitability, organic capital generation and ultimately distributions. Our cost of risk which is structurally lower thanks to disciplined underwriting, improved asset quality and coverage, has contributed to the increase of our net revenues and the decrease of their volatility. This is a differentiated advantage which we intend to defend. Our stated cost of risk remained very low at 10 basis points mainly due to the continued writebacks primarily from Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia. We are reiterating our guidance for stated cost of risk below 20 basis points for 2024. Our default rate increased from circa 1% for the full 2023 to 1.3% is exclusively driven by two single names, one of which is mostly State guaranteed. The underlying default rate is at 0.9% down year-on-year. We have taken an average of \u20ac100 million of writebacks from back to bonis per quarter since Q1 2022 and this quarter is no exception. The circa \u20ac14 billion reduction in Stage 2 performing loans this quarter is largely due to good performance of underlying portfolio. We still have circa \u20ac1.8 billion of overlays to protect our performing portfolio, highest among peers. We have a better quality of NPE with above 70% of unlikely to pay and past due to total NPE. These demonstrate our strong asset quality combined with a conservative classification and provisioning policy. To report our fees more simply, we have changed their classification as detailed in the annex. Our fee base which accounts for 34% of total revenues today, 41% in Italy, grew 8% year-over-year ex-current account fee reduction in Italy and securitization cost. Investments were up 18%, Insurance 5%, driven by Non-Life up 12% and Payment up 11%. We are particularly pleased with the diversified and balanced nature of our fee streams. The positive momentum across all fee categories reflect our strategic investments in our product factories and renewed client appetite. We see continued potential for differentiated growth as we internalize and focus on capturing more share across each product value chain. A significant portion of this fee growth is locked-in and not dependent on market dynamics, rather managerial actions. We therefore aim to achieve \u20ac1.4 billion higher run rating fees in 2026 versus 2023. Cost management remains disciplined, supporting investment in our business and people, absorbing inflation and driving overall costs down while increasing our top line. We are continuing to streamline our organization, automating processes and reducing bureaucracy. We maintain a continued focus on hirings, training and remuneration as a direct route to enhancing our product factories and digital capability. As a result, our overall costs are down \u20ac170 million quarter-on-quarter and \u20ac16 million year-on-year, offsetting 3.4% inflation in our footprint this quarter by proactively acting to manage salary drift. Our cost/income ratio reached a leading 36.2% in Q1, down 3 percentage points year-over-year and 5.5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. Q1 was one of our strongest quarter yet in organic capital generation, 118 basis points or \u20ac3.4 billion in the quarter. This allowed us to accrue our full net income of \u20ac2.6 billion for distribution while further increasing our leading CET1 ratio by 35 basis points to 16.2% and retaining a best-in-class MDA buffer of almost 600 basis points. Our disciplined focus on quality net income growth complemented by an obsessive focus on operational and capital efficiency is key to maximizing profitability and organic capital generation, enabling outsized ordinary distribution whilst strengthening capital. This model is a competitive advantage for UniCredit. As I now take you through our regions and product factories, please note the differentiated strengths and value add that each one of our regions brings to the overall group as well as the value that the group brings to each one of them, making UniCredit better than the sum of its part. Let's move to Italy. Italy has again delivered outstanding result with its ROAC reaching 31% and profit before tax \u20ac1.6 billion, up 18%. Italy continues to drive the increase in our group's fees and insurance income and profitability of NII net of LLPs. Our consistent improvement in client focus and delivery across our three financial levers, have brought us closer to our ambition of becoming the bank of choice in Italy. Net revenue grew 7% year-on-year to \u20ac2.8 billion. NII was up 13% on rates and strong pass-through management. Cost of risk increased to 33 basis points driven by the full write-off of a single name credit which is largely State guaranteed. As such, net NII was up 14%. Fees were up 11% when excluding the current account fee reduction and securitization cost, 3% otherwise. They reached 41% of overall revenues including insurance results. The continuous search for operational and capital excellence drove cost to income ratio down to below 34% and net revenue to RWA up to 10.4% with RWAs decreasing 9% or \u20ac211 billion. Our people, clients and communities remain central to how we operate. It is testament to the support that we provide our people that we have been named top employer in Europe for the eighth year in a row. We launched Buddy, a full-service fully digital branch fully integrated in our distribution channels to provide our client with a choice of how, when and where they access us. We unveiled our Third Edition of UniCredit for Italy totaling \u20ac10 billion of additional credit. Germany, with its AAA rating and leading European player status, Germany has again delivered a strong result with ROAC exceeding 23%, up 4 percentage point year-over-year and profit before tax \u20ac800 million, up 24% year-on-year supported by a standout 7% reduction in their absolute cost base. Net revenue were \u20ac1.4 billion, only 4% below our stronger ever quarter in Q1 \u201923. Strong growth in high quality NII, investment and payment fees were unable to offset last year extremely high client demand for hedging and low cost of risk. NII was down 9%, however it is slightly positive, net of higher funding cost on market positioning which are counterbalanced in trading result. Cost of risk increased to 21 basis points driven by a single name. Investment fees were up 5%, payment fees 10%, fees overall down 3% due to the exceptional high base of hedging fees in Q1 2023. The continued search for operation and capital excellence drove Germany cost/income ratio down to 38.5% and net revenue to RWA up to 8.1% with RWAs decreasing \u20ac9 billion. Our sustained commitment to supporting entrepreneurship and inclusivity has seen us reaching circa 1700 beneficiaries in underserved areas with training and workshop during the first quarter. Central Europe. Central Europe continues to deliver on our ambition to become the leader in the region both in terms of franchise and performance. ROAC reached 22%, profit before tax rose 43% to \u20ac600 million. Net revenue grew 12% year-on-year to \u20ac1.1 billion as our approach to quality growth paid off. NII was up 11% on a strong rates environment, cost of risk remained negative reaching minus 20 basis points driven by continued writebacks. Net NII was up 15%. Fees were up 10% driven by investment products. Our cost increased only 1% despite high inflation leading to an improvement of our cost to income ratio to below 37%. Net revenue to RWAs improved to 7.4% with RWAs decreasing \u20ac600 million. Our innovation in the region continues with Hungary launching onemarkets adding to successful launches in Austria, Czech Republic and Slovenia. We launched end-to-end investment via mobile in Czech Republic and Slovakia and we have issued a \u20ac750 million Green Mortgage Covered Bond in Austria. Eastern Europe continues to increase its number of primary clients driving top-line growth while maintaining sustained operational and capital efficiency. ROAC reached 39%, profit before taxes was up 29%, lending at \u20ac500 million. Net revenue grew 16% year-over-year to \u20ac700 million. Our approach to quality growth resulted in a 23% increase in NII driven by strong commercial dynamics and a favorable rate environment. Cost of risk remained negative at minus 27 basis points. Net NII was up 18%. Fees were up 13%, thanks to our focus on payments, financing and advisory. Our cost growth of 4.8% in the region was half the average inflation level contributing to a decrease in our cost to income ratio to circa 30%. Net revenue to RWAs reached 10% with RWAs increasing 10% however half our gross revenues. This quarter, we were the joint lead manager on the \u20ac1.5 billion Zero Bond offering by Republic of Croatia and the first in the Bulgarian and Bosnia and Herzegovina markets to sign a Green Renewable Energy source. We continued the rollout of our onemarket funds with 16 funds in Bulgaria and launches in Romania. Our partnership with Alpha Bank in Romania and Greece is off to a strong start. Client Solution has delivered excellent results with gross revenues up 6% to \u20ac2.9 billion of which 65% were fees, up 8%, thanks to our focus on superior quality products for our banks while contributing to capital light growth. Our Corporate Solution revenue increased 4% to \u20ac1.4 billion whilst RWAs declined 12%. Within this Advisory & Financing generated strong fees particularly in DCM and M&A, up 23% year-over-year. Payment Solution revenue increased 1% to \u20ac600 million driven by payments, up 14% which were able to offset lower current account fees to our clients in Italy. Individual Solution revenues increased 14% to \u20ac900 million driven by investments up 18% to \u20ac600 million, thanks to demand for in-house products such as onemarkets, bonds and certificate leveraging on interest rate stabilization and product innovation. Insurance was up 5% to \u20ac300 million driven by Property and Casualty up 12% and a recovery in Life Insurance up 2% from a week 2023. As promised, we are going to now go through briefly a couple of deep dives, firstly, Corporate Solution. Our ambition for Corporate Solution is to become the go-to bank for small and mid-corporate clients in our core market. We're well on our way to achieving this. This business delivered \u20ac4.9 billion of revenues in 2023 of which 37% or \u20ac1.8 billion were fees but we expect to increase by \u20ac300 million by 2026. In Advisory & Financing which contributed \u20ac2 billion in 2023, we have grown our talent base and built an advisory and capital markets -- capital-light value-adding business to both balance and benefit from our financing. This is working well with fees reaching 25% of total revenues. We expect them to increase their weight to circa one-third by 2026. Our Trade & Correspondent Banking business which contributed \u20ac1.1 billion in 2023, is a leader in Europe where we secure twice the cross-border market share that we have in any domestic market as we accompany our clients end-to-end. We continue to invest in improving our client experience, digitalization and overall quality of the service with fees representing more than half of our revenues. Our Client Risk Management Solution which delivered \u20ac1.8 billion in 2023 are designed for SME clients to whom we provide targeted offering on rates, commodities and effects. We remain focused on improving our client's connectivity and client-driven business. Fees account for 42% of total revenues. We shall reduce RWA usage and cost further through to our trading engine centralization project. Let's move to Payment Solutions. Payment Solution is a core area of investment and growth for the Group. It offers transactional payment, issuing and acquiring and current account to our 15 million clients across our 13 banks in Europe with the ambition to be every European client's first bank of choice for payment. We are well advanced in consolidating Payment Solutions into a centre of excellence, creating a united factory alongside Individual and Corporate Solutions that can provide best-in-class products and growth to our 13 banks. The business delivered \u20ac2.5 billion of revenue in 2023 of which circa 90% were fees that we expect to increase by \u20ac300 million by 2026. We are ideally positioned to be a gateway to innovation, leveraging partnership, global platform and group data intelligence. Our strong payments DNA and flexible technology make us a standout in the market. We are the number one EU bank for transactional payment with a cross-border payment market share of over three times that of intra-country payments. The business delivered \u20ac1.3 billion of revenue in 2023 of which 82% were fees which we expect to grow at a 4% CAGR out to 2026. Our inherent success factors include advanced international payments, sophisticated cash management and treasury-related solutioning FX, rates and commodities and our ability to leverage our unique pan-European network. We have three key strategic priorities here further boosting our leading position in the pan-European payment space by expanding our capabilities in mature markets to other CE and EE countries. Second, maintaining our domestic leadership in each market by extending and enhancing our product offering. Third, evolving towards a truly client-centric approach to counter emerging threats and increase our share in the business. In both Issuing and Acquiring we are in the top three leading positions in six European markets including Italy. We intend to further strengthen our position in all our 13 markets expanding our capabilities and exploiting digital payments especially in CE and EE. The business delivered business delivered \u20ac500 million of revenues in 2023 of which 91% were fees which we expect to grow at a CAGR of 8% out to 2026. In Issuing we are positioned to win in the market with 13 banks having issuing licenses performing over 5.5 million pure POS or cashless transactions per day in 2023. We have a direct issuing license model in all markets and we've insight from extensive card transaction data through a highly diversified product offering including consumer and commercial cards across prepaid debit and credit card products. In Acquiring we operate across 10 countries with a principal license model performing 5.75 million POS transaction per day in 2023. In-house acquiring is a cornerstone of our strategy which gives us a competitive edge. To further enhance our offering, we're also revamping this business proposition and product offering becoming a merchant acquiring bank with fully integrated Acquiring Solutions. Overall, we have the potential to be the standout player in the payment industry and are committed to meeting that ambition and providing excellent services to our clients. UniCredit Unlocked has already fundamentally transformed our bank laying the foundation for sustainable and profitable future. This has led to UniCredit delivering 13 consecutive quarters of profitable growth taking us to the top of the industry in terms of EPS, DPS and tangible book value per share growth, return on tangible equity, organic capital generation, distribution, operational and capital efficiency and CET1. All while continuing to invest to propel our future results and continuing to accumulate significant buffers to further protect our delivering and our distribution in the future. These include \u20ac1.5 billion non-operating items, \u20ac1.8 billion in overlays and more than \u20ac6.5 billion of excess capital going forward. We are far from being finished. We're determined to achieve our long-term ambition of excellence and have the levers to do so. We have made substantial progress in making UniCredit more efficient and effective. We shall now accelerate our journey towards a truly client-centric organization serving them as efficiently and effectively as possible. Our strategy has a dual focus. The first pillar is our operating machine. We're continuously simplifying our organization, streamlining our processes and operations and upgrading our technology. This supports our second pillar, our commercial machine. Firstly, this means continuing to empower, motivate, train and focus our people on understanding and addressing client needs. Secondly, it is developing and fully integrating alternative distribution channels to ensure that clients can access that when, how and where they want. And finally, it is about ensuring the seamless delivery of top-tier products provided through our factories and best-in-class partners via our integrated distribution channel. Going forward, we focus on continuing to expand our fee base, defending and further enhancing the profitability of our NII net of provision and the stability of our trading operations. This ensures a well-rounded and resilient top-line. Our capital accretive, NII net of LLPs, exceeds the cost of equity in its own right with low volatility. We believe to be one of the only two banks in Europe in our peer group that have delivered this much. Our quality backbook and higher strategic flexibility on volumes, along with our strong replicating portfolio, shall partly offset rates headwind and the continued compression of Russia. Our fees have substantially grown in importance and now provide a strong starting base, stable and diversified. We now have an improved mix compared to our peers, with fees at 34% of revenues and strong lever with which to grow our fees by a further \u20ac1.4 billion out to 2026, thanks to past investment and clear action to further unlock our in-house product factories. By integrating these diverse revenue streams, we are creating a high-quality top-line unmatched amongst peers and one of the critical factors to superior sustainable return on tangible equity, organic capital generation and growth. Our ability to maintain industry-leading operational and capital excellence is critical to delivering on our profitability and organic capital generation ambition and ultimately distributions. We currently rank first in cost to income ratio, cost of risk and capital efficiency. Our absolute cost base has been consistently reduced despite inflationary pressures while investing for the benefit of the business in line with UniCredit Unlocked. We have taken significant integration costs, preparing the ground for continued future cost reduction, leveraging ongoing simplification efforts. A decade of de-risking, vigilant origination and continued conservative provisioning have resulted in a structurally lower and much less volatile cost of risk, which we trust we will be able to maintain below 20 basis points this year and within the 20 basis points to 25 basis points over the cycle, leveraging the release of our \u20ac1.8 billion of overlays. We have improved our capital efficiency since UniCredit Unlocked, delivering now best-in-class organic capital generation to support sustainable and significant distribution without denting CET1. Our discipline is now embedded and we expect it to continue unabated. Our unique BNL buffer substantially derisk our ability to deliver our bottom line and combined with the usage of or return of our excess capital shall support greater total distributions. We are upgrading our net profit guidance to in excess of \u20ac8.5 billion versus our previous guidance of broadly in line and you all know what my personal ambition is. This is driven by a strong Q1 which puts us ahead of our run rate for the year and a better outcome on systemic charges which we now expect to be around \u20ac400 million lower than \u201923 or circa \u20ac200 million better than we had anticipated. Given our healthier profitability and most importantly, organic capital generation and excess capital return commitment, we are upgrading our expected 2024 total distribution to circa \u20ac8.6 billion in line with 2023. This continues to represent the highest total distribution yield in the industry. Accordingly we are accruing 100% of net profit in the first quarter. Our dividend payout remains at 40% of net profit or circa \u20ac3.4 billion. Our 2024 calendar distribution could now exceed \u20ac10 billion. We aim to commence the first tranche of a remainder of a 2023 share buyback as soon as possible after results. There will be more tranches soon thereafter. We are confident that in the next three years we will continue to offer a compelling investment opportunity across strong growth of EPS and DPS, profitability and best-in-class total distribution underpinned by organic capital generation and excess capital deployment or return, no later than 2027. In the event that our excess capital cannot be deployed and is therefore returned in full to our shareholders, we anticipate based on our profitability an organic capital generation assumption that our total annual average distribution \u201924 to \u201926 will be either equal in \u201924 or above \u20ac8.6 billion in \u201925 and \u201926. As such, we should be able to return in this event half of our current market cap to our shareholders within the next three years. Should any of the excess capital be deployed, the level of total annual distribution shall remain best-in-class but depend in their amount on the return on those investments. We confirm that traditional bank acquisition shall be executed only if they fit strategically and if their POS synergies return compare favorably with those of our share buyback. Our transformation efforts have delivered consistent outstanding results across all KPIs, surpassing our peers. As of Q1, we are the leader in terms of EPS, DPS and tangible book per share growth, return on tangible equity, cost/income ratio, CET1, organic capital generation and expected 2024 distribution yield. And we're not done as our guidance for \u201925 and \u201926 and in general for the next three years demonstrates. We remain an even more attractive investment opportunity as our past performance and future prospects are still not reflected in our evaluation. Both our price to earnings and price to distribution multiples remained at a substantial discount to not only top peers but also to the sector particularly when adjusted for excess capital and the comfort provided by our lines of defense. Before I open to question, I would like to leave you with three key messages. One, this quarter has once again demonstrated the effectiveness of our UniCredit Unlock strategy. Our metrics of growth, profitability, and distribution set a benchmark for the industry. Two, looking forward we have plenty of runway left and are excited at the opportunity to show what we can do when rates and cost of risk normalize. In addition, we shall maintain a distribution yield and strategic optionality that are unmatched. Thirdly, our valuation is far from reflecting the above and we remain focused on continuing to deliver the results and distribution but will ultimately drive it to where it should be. Thank you everyone. And I now open for questions.\nOperator: This is the Chorus Call conference operator. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ignacio Cerezo with UBS. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Cerezo : Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Can I ask you for a little more color in terms of the breakdown of net profit growth in absolute terms and the share count reduction over \u201925 and \u201926? And you seem to be suggesting a strong EPS growth. Again I'm looking for a little bit of color basically in terms of the absolute versus the per share. And then the second one is, maybe you can give us a little bit of information around how much seasonality the fee number has included this quarter. This is very strong everywhere. I mean I've seen that the gross fee [indiscernible] have increased I think from \u20ac9 billion to \u20ac14 billion. So just trying to understand the path of the fee line actually through the year? Thank you very much.\nAndrea Orcel : I'll start and then Stefano will continue, Ignacio. So in terms of EPS and DPS what is which? I think we have purposely gone on EPS and DPS because it all depends on the speed and significance of the rates reduction and how the pass-through is managed. So we anticipate to be able to absorb the headwinds but the speed at which that happens vis-a-vis the offsetting levers, i.e. fees, i.e. cost, i.e. cost of risk which is going to normalize and the release of some of our buffers is at this point in time difficult to predict exactly. But suffice to say that we intend to defend our line of profitability at the moment at least and hopefully once we normalize, grow it further from there. With respect to the fees what I would say is that everyone has had very strong fees in this quarter. A lot is driven by clients moving in anticipation of rate reductions. It's difficult again to understand how much of that move will continue into second and third. I personally would not multiply by four, if I were you. But there is definitely a very positive trend going forward on rebalancing from other investments that were let's say preferred while we were in a higher interest rate environment to investment that are more in line to what it was before the rising rate. I would also highlight that in our question, that goes back to your first question, timing is important because for example our fees next year will benefit from internalization of insurance. Our fees in asset management are benefiting by internalization of some of the value change as we develop our in-house products. That's timing. Our fees in Payments are benefiting by the rollout of a MasterCard agreement and our agreement with Nexi and other initiatives. So it's a question of timing between what our idiosyncratic industrial transformation of the factories and of the very fee engine occurs and at the same time how fast the NII comes down and to which level due to the rates environment. But maybe Stefano can add to that.\nStefano Porro : Yes, if you look the performance year-on-year on our fees, you should take into consideration that we have a double digit growth on Property and Casualty, and Payment fees. Such a double digit growth in a way is sustainable. I mean it's connected to the activity of the clients but having said that, is more sustainable than what we can expect in relation to the investment fees in the sense that we still have a good pace in relation to the investment fees but a part of the trend that we saw is deriving from the rebalancing of the portfolio of the clients. So a part of that should normalize during the course of the year.\nAndrea Orcel : Ignacio, one last thing, we're not changing our guidance on fees for the year, so it will be a few hundreds up. So what you're seeing in the first quarter is part market as Stefano said and part the rollout of our plan. The rollout of our plan continues, the part of the market we need to see what happened and how does it stabilize it over the next two or three quarters.\nIgnacio Cerezo : Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Delphine Lee with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nDelphine Lee: Hi, morning, thanks for taking my questions. My first one is just on net revenue guidance which is unchanged at \u20ac22.5 billion. It looks like your cost of risk is definitely running better and revenues in general. I take your point on investment fees and part of that is, could save a bit in the next two quarters but Q1 is a very strong performance in trading as well. So just trying to think about what does that mean for net interest income and if you could just give us a bit of color of what are the moving parts and if there is any concerns or from the deposit pass-through increasing a bit higher maybe? And then my second question is on M&A. Thanks for the update but just kind of wondering a little bit so the criteria are clear. Now just thinking, the horizon is 2027 or should we -- could we consider something a bit earlier than that? I mean what are you thinking here in terms of also areas of interest, M&A wise? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel : Delphine, if I bought all my shares this year the market could not absorb it, so now seriously. So I'll frame a little bit and then I'll pass to Stefano. Let me start with the second one. So we said at least 2027 and I think we are committing given our expectation with respect to net profit and organic capital generation more than committing, we're guiding to exceed \u20ac8.6 billion in distribution. So we have a buffer. I mean you can do \u20ac6.5 billion in -- up to the end of \u201927 or you can do it a little bit earlier but that should give confidence that total distribution can be supported. And how much every year will depend on a number of factors including how well we do on the ordinary and how well we do and what do we do in deployment of capital and other things. But we have set a line of trying to beat the \u201923 distributions. More generally and then I'll pass it to Stefano. I had that question before, why are -- what is our guidance and what has changed? I think what we have just done is before we were broadly in line now we say in excess of \u20ac8.5 billion, so we have broadly in line may mean plus minus \u20ac200 million. We've cut the downside and we said we're not going to be below \u20ac8.5 billion and actually above and we've kept the upside, that's what we have done. So if you look at Q1, one thing is certain, the results are well ahead of trend line that we expected and they have given us the confidence to be more secure that the downside is -- that we can manage with any downside. Now we're only in Q1, so we're not going to give you more than that. In terms of fees, we expect the same -- similar performance to what we were saying. In terms of NII, at the moment we have more encouraging results. But let's see what happens not only in the second but in the second part of a year when rates should decline and how fast they decline. So there are still quite a lot of moving parts so I would say that the general message is given where we are and what we're seeing we have cut the bottom and we have left open the upside.\nStefano Porro : So integrating on net interest income, so key elements, one is rates, a few basis points less rates in Q1. All-in-all, the average of \u201924 should be higher than the average of \u201923. This should positively impact the net interest income but as rate [indiscernible] in the second part of the year there will be a reduction of the rate so from that perspective is important to bear that in mind. Replicating portfolio contribution is slightly better than the expectation, so for the full year in comparison to 2023 will be above \u20ac400 million, so that's a positive side. Russia contribution negative, so concerning the leveraging ongoing you can expect few hundred million less net interest income in the next three quarters. Pass-through, I have to say, pass-through it's a couple of percentage up so we are at 30%. We are expecting to close the year with a average that is slightly above 30% so we then an exit Q4 close to 35%. So all-in-all, this should negatively contribute to net interest income, however as commented before the two positive news, rates on one end and the replicating portfolio contribution on the other end. Volume side, we do expect during the course of 2024 an exit level of the lending stock lower than the beginning of the year mainly for the trend that we are seeing here in Italy. It will be different for 2025 with regards to client rate trend on the lending side so far so good, so the repricing is ongoing and especially on the new lending production but it's not such to have a meaningful contribution to net interest income in comparison to what we've gathered for.\nDelphine Lee: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrea Filtri with Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Filtri: Good morning. Could you please provide us with the net interest income contribution this quarter from the several State eco-bonuses 110% and all the likes? And what is the updated exposure at the end of the quarter in terms of your obedience? And then the second question regards bank assurance, you indicated the next year integration of the product factories. Does this also imply your application to be a financial conglomerate and what is the technicality and schedule to obtain this qualification? Thank you.\nStefano Porro: So in relation to the exposure is to eco bonus related credit is around \u20ac6 billion, the quarterly contribution is around \u20ac35 million per year. So this is fundamentally what we had also in relation to Q1. With regards bank insurance, it will be depending on a couple of factors. So one, the timing of the execution of internalization, the second one is the timing connected to the interaction with the regulator that will start in advance. So all-in-all, we can expect that such a regulation treatment can be achieved by a year in terms of horizon after the moment when we will execute.\nOperator: The next question is from Antonio Reale with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAntonio Reale : Hi, good morning, everyone. It's Antonio from Bank of America, two questions for me please, the first one on the positive remuneration and the second one on Russia. The first one, can you give us an update in terms of what you are seeing both from competition and from your client base when it comes to the positive pricing, maybe with a commentary across your key geographies, I think you have slightly moved up your pass-through assumptions for the year. I am trying to understand if it is a function of the change in assumptions on interest rates or actual changes in the deposit remuneration in absolute terms? That\u2019s my first question. Secondly, you have besides your local subsidiary in Russia, which is liquid, well capitalized. I think you were allowed to upstream some dividends, if I am not wrong. And you\u2019ve talked about the risk in targets of above 10% a year, what is the end game for you in Russia now? What do you expect to be roughly the contribution to P&L this year coming from Russia? Thank you.\nStefano Porro: Let's start from the deposit, so we commented about deposit pass-through that is around 30%, we\u2019re moving up from 28% in Q4. Some comments in relation to the region, so Italy we are at 14.5%, in terms of deposit pass-through, we are up from 13.8%. Overall, the deposit mix is still tilted towards site deposit, so we have 96% of site deposit, so there is fundamentally no contribution to term. There is a not meaningful change in the behavior of the clients and from that perspective, yes, the composition is there especially on term offer but it is not such to meaningfully impact the pass-through. In Germany, the deposit composition is a different one because the site depo, to give the flavor is around 55%, so it is a completely different one. There the competition on term deposit is different, it is there. In Germany, there was an increase of the deposit pass-through and as a consequence also of the overall client rate, the deposit pass-through move up from 41% to around 43%. Central Europe, we move from 41% in Q4 to around 44%. Main country where there is an increased level of pass-through competition is Austria in line with the market rates. And Austria move from close to 40% to around 43%, Eastern Europe was 24%, now we are at 27%. All-in-all the trend of the pass-through is in line with the expectation as later the competition is higher especially in Austria for we see a stabilization in relation especially on the Corporate side across the board. There is still some movement on the Individual side especially in private banking and then we are not expecting a minimum change in the pattern during the course of Q2 to be seen the velocity of the repricing especially in the euro area when rates will start moving down in the second half of the year.\nAndrea Orcel : So with respect to Russia, our cross-border exposure is down 91% over the two-year period of \u20ac5.6 billion and we have managed it in a very disciplined fashion, calm fashion, I would say and managed to lose single digit on it. So we consider that the right way to go and we expect that the cross-border exposure that remains will practically be dealt with or reversed by the end of 2025. With respect to the local exposure, our local exposure is down 67% over the last two years or so and we are continuing to compress decisively and we will continue to do that in the next few years and you should expect an accelerated decline. With respect to the end game, I think all we can do is do well what we control. We control the level of our business, we control what we do, how we protect against sanctions, compliance events, etc., etc., that we do. Obviously, if there were an opportunity to sell it or if there were an opportunity to further accelerate our disengagement, we would. At this point in time and certainly vis-a-vis where we were two years ago, the impact on capital and P&L from that exit has been vastly reduced and I think we continue to do that. We are already factoring in the numbers that we are giving you, which is why you should look, considering that, the trends. With that in mind, obviously the compression of Russia is taking out NIIs, is taking out bottom line and correctly so, but the decline is not all underlying business, which means if you take Russia away, the underlying business is performing better than the numbers you are looking at now.\nAntonio Reale : Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Ignacio Ulargui with BNP Paribas Exane. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Ulargui : Thanks very much for the presentation and for taking my questions. I have two, if I may. The first one is on cost and how should we think about cost going from here after the four months that you have delivered in 1Q? If you could break up that in the main geography, that would be great. The second one is on fees and looking to the disclosure that you have given on payments, thanks very much for that. I was just trying to better understand how do you see the current accounts fees going forward and how that \u20ac300 million growth in fees by 2026 will be split within these three buckets that you have given us? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel : So, cost. As I said, I think that by now the entire UniCredit is obsessively focused on efficiency. And we are guiding to cost below \u20ac9.5 billion this year, which means we will have had, effectively in the next three years, declining costs gradually, orderly, every quarter and I think we are going to try to keep it that way for as long as we can. There will be, in terms of absolute decline, a bar at some point, but we're not at that bar now and that allows us to do the following things. One, absorb inflation, salary drift and other. So, one that. Two, absorb investments that we're making in hiring new people, in training, in technology, etc., etc. And three, to obviously improve the jaws and the cost/income ratio to a greater extent than people that are maybe more focused on the top-line. We focus on both as obsessively and we will continue to do that. What happens by geography obviously is different. I mean, we have geographies that are, let's call them stable. Those geographies are rationalizing cost to a greater extent than geographies who have higher inflation and are growing much faster, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, where due to inflation and much faster growth, the ability to keep costs negative is not there. But if you look at the dynamics of growth of top line inflation versus cost, we are creating a positive gap everywhere. If I look at fees, I would just say on current account. As you know, we cut our current account fees to Italian clients in April 2023. So going forward, the comparison is for like-for-like. So in the second, third and fourth quarter and first of this year, we've always had to tell you, look, the underlying fees are these, but because we cut the current account fees to our Italian clients, they look less. From the second quarter onward, the comparison will be like-for-like. So while we're not changing our guidance for fees, and you know what it is, when you look at the growth, you should look at underlying because the current account fees are there and they're not going to move. But I don't know if Stefano wants to give more.\nStefano Porro: Yeah, just simply adding that in relation to the \u20ac300 million growth of payment services until 2026, the contribution of the growth is not coming from current account. So you can consider a fundamental stability is deriving from two sets of activities. So one is issuing, so meaning cards, and the second one is payment systems or transactional payments. So these are the two engine that will contribute to the \u20ac300 million growth.\nIgnacio Ulargui : Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Azzurra Guelfi with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAzzurra Guelfi: Hi, good morning. Two questions for me. One is on your Client Solution business. Do you think that there has been a change of perception of delivery positioning from both competitors and clients and now you are a forefront for growing more and this is something that is well received from clients? The second one is still on the [indiscernible]. You have made several changes and investment and refraction in this part. I am aware of the -- among the contractor negotiation and the insurance coming into place next year. But is there any other investments or reshaping that you would like to do into this business? Or it's just about now taking the benefit of everything that has been done so far? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel : Thank you, Azzurra. So Client Solutions. Let's start with where we are. I think this is one of the question you should have for Alpha Bank in Greece. I think that demonstrates that the quality, the level, the appropriateness and the way it's designed of our solution across investments, across insurance, across payments, across trade finance, and I can continue and across that integral market, of course, are done in such a way that they are particularly targeted to the clients of a commercial banks, i.e. small and medium corporates, affluent clients, private banking, that stream. And indeed we are very pleased and I think they are very pleased of what can be done with our factories in third parties, which fundamentally means that they are adding value, otherwise they wouldn't be making it. The same I would say if you look at Central and Eastern Europe and you take specific countries, I don't know, Bulgaria, Bosnia, it would be difficult for them to have the breadth and quality of, for example, investment products that they can instead get because we have centralized factories. So if you look at the rollout of onemarket, in many of these countries that rollout does not replace existing products, it just is what it is because now we can provide a product that maybe our partners would not find the rationale of a critical mass to deploy for one market alone. We are actually by leveraging group size, providing our smaller countries or countries that were mainstream asset managers, insurance companies, etc., etc., are not present. So I think it's definitely value added and I think in those countries we're definitely increasingly associated with quality fees, quality solution and other streams beyond just lending. And you can see it in the growth rates. They are growth rates from a low base but there are high growth rates. I think in the mind of clients there are a number of things. I would say that in Italy if I take P&C away from CPI, it was something we were practically absent three years ago and now I would say that most of our growth in Non-Life is that because you have noticed that the volumes in mortgages and other products are not growing. So the growth, where does it come from? Other products which were practically at zero three years ago and that is well known to our individual clients, that is also well known in the targeted offering we have for SME clients. So I would say you need to ask for what clients but I think the numbers indicate that it is working. I think in terms of Amundi and other contracts, first of all, please do not -- when you look at all of these things, so Amundi, when you look at internalization of insurance, when you look at that, there is a delta but the delta is not 100% meaning. If I am telling you that we are internalizing in excess of 73%, 74% of the value chain in asset management and we are aiming to go to 82% and we are doing that without producing but by distributing third party and packaging and improving the performance of what we distribute, we cannot go to 100% and in any case the delta is between 75% and 82%. The delta is not between 0 and 100%. If you take Life Insurance, we are already being paid for distribution. As we pull in Life Insurance, we will benefit from the underwriting of the product but the distribution is already within our fee base. So don't do 0-100% but they will contribute. So one, Asset Management, you are seeing it in let's say in-flight with onemarket and the other initiatives along this line. Two, Insurance will occur next year and you will see Life Insurance coming in-house during the course of next year. Three, on Payments, there are a number of initiatives which are completely along the same lines of what we have done in Asset Management and Insurance. So we look for the right partners, in this case for example MasterCard. We tend to create a partnership, so not multiple renegotiated every time but one contract, one partnership, mutual investment in technology, in product, in growth and usually better economic outcome because the stability of the partnership makes it clear to both sides that we don't want to put it in risk. So you're seeing some of this already progressing in payments. There will be other initiatives in payment that are not public yet, that we're going to roll out and that are going to accrete and move us into that direction. I would say that in Payment, especially transactional payment, the difference is that that is already in-house and there will be significant investment in technology to further secure not only the service and our leadership but also our ability to cross-sell a number of products that we can do when we go end-to-end between a country and another. And I can continue with all the factories but so if you take advisory and capital market, we have no ambition to become a leading global investment bank but in our client base, in our mid-cap client base and also small-cap, we want to be the dominant player. And therefore the level of service and what we do is focused on getting our advisory and capital market to work tightly together with our banks to attack those segment of clients where global investment bank don't reach because they are too small and local player reach but don't have the ability to serve because they cannot rebuild the same level of service. That is the philosophy we're going across and I do absolutely believe that it's more and more clear to clients that if they need advice on certain things we're there for them and you see it in the numbers of advisor and capital markets, for example.\nOperator: Next question is from Britta Schmidt with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nBritta Schmidt : Hi, there. Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on M&A. We can all work out what your financial hurdles are, but could you just explain what makes a good strategic fit for UniCredit, especially with the strategy that you've laid out? Is it a type of loan book? Is it capital-light, a certain type of client base, and where do you think you could add something to a deal? And the second one is on risk-weighted assets, based on another strong reduction from portfolio management, including securitizations. What further measures do you think you can undertake here? And maybe you can give us an idea of what is included in the excess capital guide to more than \u20ac6.5 billion to 2025 in terms of RWA? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel : On M&A, it's a little bit, every time I have this answer, it's broad. Okay? So I could make, I don't know if you consider that M&A, but I could make an investment in a fintech that provides us a technology platform to accelerate what we're doing in a certain segment of business. That usually is not large, but it doesn't have the same multiple and the same profile as a traditional bank M&A. But in our investment profile, when we look at return on investment and IRR, it needs to hurdle. Everything we do needs to hurdle. Hurdle means that when people tell you it's strategic, it's usually to convince you to do something that does not return above the cost of equity and therefore it\u2019s strategic. In our case, you're never going to hear that. So we're going to tell you it's strategic because it makes sense that we develop our platform with this technology on this and it hurdles over the life of the investment and we're very thorough in looking at that. We could look at, for example, the metrics for internalizing Life Insurance are different from the one of a traditional bank. But I would say that many of you will tell me that especially because of the Danish compromise, the return on the capital employed is a no brainer and therefore you should be doing it. But if I look at straight P's, P's in insurance are higher than in banks. So but the return on investment makes all of the sense and given that it doesn't consume almost any capital, it becomes a good investment for us and so on and so forth. So if I take a traditional bank, so the same kind of overall, then it's quite easy and if I can buy an overall bank, meaning UniCredit at under seven times earnings, it's very difficult for me to justify you all and our investors that it's a good idea if post synergies it costs me 10. So we will do it only if it beats our share buybacks. But then more generally, what are we looking at? Anything that strengthens the franchise. So we could look at things, so in Insurance, as we're internalizing insurance, strengthen the franchise. We can look at things in technology to accelerate the rollout of certain ideas that we have. That is just the beginning, but we could do other things in that area. We can look at traditional banks if they fit. And the question is, we all take a step back and we say, okay, does that increase the value of our franchise, does that create over time a better return than either not doing anything or buying back our shares? If the answer is yes, we do it across the board. Because you asked me for metrics, I have to refer to traditional banks, but otherwise I would give you a long table with, if it's a fintech X, if it's an insurance Y, and that becomes a little bit ridiculous. With respect to RWAs and the excess capital, and Stefan is going to guide you in further details, the excess of over \u20ac6.5 billion already embeds the impact from Balfour and still keeps us ahead of 13%. There are debates as to whether ahead of 13% plus Balfour is the right number or not, but the \u20ac6.5 billion is above 13% fully including Balfour and all the regulatory headwinds that we know of at this time. With respect to what we're going to do on, let's say, more ordinarily RWAs, the same. Which means deploy our capital, therefore our RWAs above the cost of equity, and therefore make sure that in as much as possible our NII net of provision, which is where we deploy our capital, exceeds the cost of equity, critical in a bank, to provide profitability. Profitability, not net profit, profitability return on equity and distribution, and not destroy them. And secondly, increase the weight of fees, because obviously fees are zero RWAs. So the blended then beats in terms of return on tangible and distribution. That's looking forward. Looking backwards, which is what over time is reducing and then shall almost disappear, is the management of our backbook to make sure that the entire backbook portfolio fits the metric of exceeding the cost of equity. As we said many times, Britta, we were, let's say, 30%, 40% was at that level before. Now we are over 60%, I think it is, or 70%, sorry. We're going to go 80%, 85%, 90% but we\u2019re never going to be 100%. Nobody has 100%. So that will over time decrease, and at that point we will be reliant on the profitability and the capital generation of our NII net of provision and the fees, plus the capital impact from \u201926 onward of our DTAs, which will start contributing and adding again to our capital generation above and beyond what is ordinary and organic.\nStefano Porro: So some data points, securitization and active portfolio management. So we're assuming to execute a few billions of securitization, both in \u201924 and \u201925, so on top of what we have already executed. Active portfolio management action, the same. Do consider that the overall stock of risk-weighted assets related to EVA-negative clients on the corporate side is around \u20ac20 billion at group level. So as a matter of fact, part of that will be improved working on the revenue side, so cross-selling and so on. Part of that is likely going to be not rollover, so will contribute to the active portfolio management action in \u201924 and \u201925. With regards to the regulatory impact in relation to Basel IV, let's say last estimate is between 85 basis points and 290 basis points, is mainly operational risk. So it's around 70 basis point operational risk. Do take into consideration that that is mainly connected to our revenues, so the more we do revenues, the more we have a risk-weighted asset and operational risk. And the more we are reducing risk-weighted assets, the more the business point impact is higher. So all-in-all, the reason why the impact on Basel IV is slightly more is because we are betting on revenues and we are betting on risk-weighted asset management. Okay? So nothing wrong. Finally, in relation to the business dynamic, we are not expecting a meaningful contribution of business-driven risk-weighted assets during the course of 2024, for what we have commented before in relation to the lending trend. While in \u201925 and \u201926, considering that we are expecting a reversal of the stock of lending, meaning going back to growth, we are currently assuming also some risk-weighted asset inflation that are in from business dynamics. But as related by Andrea, all has been taken into consideration for what we have gathered for in relation to capital plan.\nBritta Schmidt : Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Marco Nicolai with Jeffries. Please go ahead.\nMarco Nicolai : Hi, thanks for taking my question. First one is on technology. Obviously, you are largely focused on cost and you are able to set costs of technology investment. Can you just remember us what you are doing on this front and how you are leveraging your pan-European footprint on the technology? Second one, I was wondering, since the business plan this year comes to a conclusion, I'm talking about UniCredit Unlocked, are you planning a new business plan presentation, I don't know, sometimes in the last quarter or maybe early next year? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: As most of my colleagues at UniCredit know, we are never done. So we just keep on moving the boundaries out. I would say that for UniCredit Unlocked, too early to say. I don't think that UniCredit Unlocked is over, meaning UniCredit Unlocked is an approach, it's a vision, it's a strategy and it's the constant pursuit of certain KPIs across revenue growth, sustainable and profitable across operational excellence with cost/income ratio at the best end of the industry across capital excellence, across all of these things to be able to sustainably return on tangible above -- much above and beyond our cost of equity and to create a model that is highly cash generative so that we can reward our investors more than the benchmark. So if you look at that then when we announced UniCredit Unlocked we were all about fees and then what happened, we had a war two months later and we have rates going up a year later or less. And therefore our plan was all about NII pass-through and building without forgetting that we needed to build further fees for when that passed. And I think what you're seeing going forward regardless of what we will do with a new plan or not, is a continuation of that adapted it for an environment that is changing. So it is difficult to think that we can substantially increase as we have done in the last three years, our cost to income, our cost of risk, our capital efficiency. Difficult, we can hold but difficult. If you look at emphasis, our emphasis is how the other engine and a half, which is fees and some trading, can offset as much as possible the impact from normalization of rates and cost of risk on NII. That's the challenge, if we can do that while keeping the rest going back to what Ignacio was saying at the beginning, we will be able to stabilize our net profit and most importantly, our return on tangible well ahead of 15% and then as volume come back, grow from there and maintain a more normalized orderly growth from that level. We will keep the surprise as to where we do and when we do on Investor Day. With respect to technology and then I'll pass it to Stefano, I think the direction is very clear. So direction number one is, in as much as possible and all of you probably realize how difficult that is to have -- the ambition is to have at some point in time one technology for the entire group. Why? Not because I particularly like it or not like, it is because you need to go back to that. If we were to be able to do that we would have a scale advantage in technology equivalent to a bank that is simple in onemarket. So that is worth a lot of efficiency, it's worth speed, it's worth client journey, it\u2019s worth everything. But that is not easy. I think how many bank even have one technology in one market and we're saying we want one technology in 13. So it is a journey, it is a mindset that when we develop things, we're trying to get them to converge. But we also realize that if I wanted to do that and that was my sole objective, my 13 banks would stop because they would not be able to roll out all the things they're rolling out. And in a number of countries we are a technology leader and we have taken technology to a very high level, take Croatia, take Bulgaria and we're not going to delay them because of the group product. We are going to try to get it to converge. The second thing is, thank God, sometimes you're lucky, when you wait and you're the second mover, cloud is allowing an acceleration and it's a lot easier to do and it's a lot cheaper to do and will allow us to go in that direction. But as Ali and I discuss all the time, the way we look at technology is, okay this is better from a technology standpoint. But better needs to deliver, better revenue, better cost, better client experience, and outcome. If it doesn't, we're a private enterprise and we're going to look at it in a different way. So that is the philosophy and that is happily applied by Stefano who will give you more details about it.\nStefano Porro : Thank you, Andrea. So let's start from some data, some financials. So in relation to the IT investment in the Unlock plan, the environmental IT investment, I hold the amount of IT cash out was around \u20ac2.8 billion. We are in line with that, last year we've invested more than \u20ac700 million in terms of IT investment cash out and this year will be more than that. We are doing initiatives, let's say, on one end on efficiency, on the other end on change and effectiveness. On efficiency, clearly we have a renegotiation contract and we will negotiate contract with our partners and we are also in-sourcing people and skills, right? In order, let's say, with the ultimate goal to keep under our control the inflation that is absolutely there also when we are dealing with IT cost. With regards to the change, we are fundamentally investing on fundamentally four pillars. Cyber security, the amount that we are investing on cyber security is the same, slightly growing. Then we have the experience platform that are fundamentally connected with our key strategic priorities, i.e. were invested in the client experience platform, for example, consumer financing. But that Andrea highlighted before is one of them and we are doing the same also on Insurance and we will do on Payment. So this type of client experience digital investment are totally in line with our key strategic priorities towards clients. Then we have data, so we will have investment in relation especially to the improvement of data taking into consideration how much data is important, let's say also to run the business and to properly serve the clients. And then as highlighted by Andrea, we are also locating a part of the investment to cloud, meaning fundamentally to the infrastructure with the same goal. So in this case is partly efficiency because we can also harmonize and reducing the normal application that we have but on the other hand we can also speed an increase in the speed of delivery properly shifting from mainframe to cloud over the next years.\nMarco Nicolai : Thank you, very interesting.\nOperator: The last question is from Chris Hallam with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead\nChris Hallam: Good morning, everyone. So just a quick one to begin with. So regarding the commitment to return the excess capital later than 2027, can I just check, does that mean distribution in relation to \u201927, i.e. the dividends and buybacks conducted in 2028? Or that it's all done and dusted by the end of December \u201927? And then second, on M&A, the move higher I guess in valuation multiples across the sectors has in theory made the backdrop a bit more supportive for M&A. But again, you've previously talked about the need to achieve alignment between willing buyers and willing sellers. And if we look around at recent developments in the space, it looks like that alignment can still be a stumbling block. So perhaps to what extent do you think the delivery of UniCredit Unlocked is now a key support in enabling you to achieve that alignment in the future, i.e. to convince the seller that you can deliver on integration and operational improvements ahead of what they might be able to achieve on a standalone basis?\nAndrea Orcel: Okay, so the capital return, end of \u201927 done and dusted and I said, at least or later, sorry, latest. So we will gauge the speed based on everything else to be able to deliver compelling distribution in the meantime. Then M&A, I think there I mean from our point of view, we have the following factors. Point number one, well, we have and we're very confident and excited about a great runway going forward. We have moved firmly from a probably something that looked more like a restructuring story, therefore with jumps in net income doubling and doubling or whatever it is to more of a normalized high value bank that obviously by definition is closer to reaching its excellence outcome and therefore has less internal delta than what we had in 2021. Now it's a higher quality delta, you have a contribution from valuation all of these things. And we think that relative to the sector we're going to perform better in terms of that runway and that trend line significantly better but it is less than the jumps we've made every year in the last three. So that means that when we look at benchmarks and when we look at that M&A has a benchmark that is easier to match. The second thing that has happened is that I do believe that not only we are more credible in our ability to extract value from a banking franchise but beside the credibility we're confident internally and capable of replicating what we've done on our franchise on others. And we think that that is a competitive advantage and we think that those two things bring our ability to extract synergies above and beyond what is the average on a spreadsheet, quite tangible and quite [grown]. And that's the second positive. The third positive is to be seen and that is when the tide goes down and the substantial tailwind from rates and cost of risks normalizes, I think we will see a differentiated performance between the banks that have tried to crystallize 110% of that tailwind and therefore did relatively little to look at afterwards and the banks who have invested a lot, re-engineered a lot and taken some of the benefits from that tailwind to invest further in improving themselves that, that will be more capable to absorb the shock and then grow from there at a differentiated level. We believe we are in the second category. We believe that if some of the targets are in the first, it will create a better alignment in valuation to fundamentals. So if you get a better alignment evaluation to fundamental, if we can extract more value and we are at a point where our credibility and our capability of doing it has increased, M&A is more probable. With respect to targets, I think that if I asked any of you what are the targets or possible target in any market? We should -- we would all end up with the same list not only for UniCredit but more generally. So the question is, as you said, opportunity and opportunity is there a willing buyer and a willing seller and on the other hand are the economics and the ability to execute make sense. If you're getting those two but I do think we're going in a direction where probably the opportunity becomes more probable.\nChris Hallam: Super helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Gentlemen the floor is back to you for any closing remarks.\nAndrea Orcel: Thank you very much to everyone and we'll see some of you during our Road Show.

      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Thank you, Magda. Good morning and thank you all for joining. Our Q1 \u201924 results are the embodiment of the continued hard work by those at UniCredit and our commitment to continuously pursue excellence. They underscore again, that UniCredit Unlocked is the right strategy as we build on our momentum, adapting and navigating the changing external environment to the benefit of all our stakeholders. We remain an attractive investment opportunity as our past performance and future prospects are still not reflected in our valuation. Both our price to earnings and price to distribution multiples remain at a substantial discount to both sector and top peers. Our commitment to excellence has resulted in our best first quarter ever and our 13th consecutive quarter of year-on-year profitable growth, setting new benchmarks in performance across all regions, product lines and metrics. This success is underpinned by resilient, profitable net NII, robust fee generation and improved operational and capital excellence with every region and business contributing to making a better whole. We have spent the last three years securing a position of industry leadership as we continue to outperform expectations and peers while building strong foundations of investments, capital, asset quality and liquidity to support our future. During the next three years, we remain committed to completing our UniCredit Unlocked transformation, further growing our results while delivering outsized returns. We will increase our focus on clients to counteract macro headwinds and further improve earnings quality. We will propel our top line by further expanding our fee base, crystallizing the investments and the work of the past three years while defending our unique high-quality net interest income net of loan loss provision that already exceed our cost of equity. All while striving to maintain our leadership in operational and capital efficiency. Finally, we will benefit from the gradual release of our extensive profit and loss buffers. We are confident in our ability to deliver our mid-term guidance of strong growth in EPS, DPS and tangible book value per share, return on tangible equity above 15% and overall distribution above 2023, thanks to our expected organic capital generation and excess capital return. For UniCredit, excellence means consistently delivering superior results, exceeding our strategic objectives and leading the industry across all KPIs. The mindset, this mindset, is our competitive advantage. Our growth is profitable, constantly outperforming expectation while investing and creating lines of defense for our future to ensure sustainability. Our outstanding performance is across all our three financial levers. Net revenues reached \u20ac6.3 billion, up 7.5% year-on-year; NII was up 9% with LLPs flat and low; fees up 3%, or 8% excluding current account fees, reduction in Italy and securitization costs. We have continued to improve our operational efficiency, reducing absolute cost by 1% to \u20ac2.3 billion while absorbing inflation and propelling investments. Our cost-to-income ratio improved further to 36.2%, three percentage point better than a year ago. Similarly, we have continued to improve our capital efficiency with net revenue to RWAs reaching 8.9%, up from 7.7% a year ago, with RWA's down \u20ac5 billion to \u20ac280 billion. All contributed to deliver a record return on tangible equity at 13% CET1 of 23%, up 2.6 percentage point year-on-year; a net profit of \u20ac2.6 billion, up 24% year-on-year; and an organic capital generation of \u20ac3.4 billion or 118 basis points, which allowed us to accrue \u20ac2.6 billion or 100% of our net profit in Q1 for distribution whilst increasing our CET1 ratio by 35 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 16.2%. These translate into an EPS up 42% year-on-year; a DPS up 64% year-on-year; and a tangible book value per share up 25% year-on-year. These results are built on strong foundation across leading capital levels, sound asset quality and strong liquidity ratio with LCR above 140% and NSFR above 125%. All regions and all product factories contributed to these results. Our net revenue is broken down into three categories, Net Interest Income net of LLPs, Fees and Trading & Others. Our focus on quality growth has resulted in structurally low loan loss provision and a net NII that continues to exceed our cost of equity. We believe to be only one of two banks who have achieved this. Our Fees have experienced strong and broad based growth leading to a top tier fee-to-revenue ratio, reflecting our investment in product factories over the last three years. Our Trading & Other revenue has been primarily driven by core client activity which has supported its resiliency. We recognize that NII net of provision plays an important role in our top line. We have successfully focused on keeping it above our cost of equity while laying the foundation for its profitable future growth. Gross NII and margins are slightly down quarter-on-quarter as rates have peaked and volumes have not recovered. This appears to be a better dynamic though than peers particularly given our focus on profitability rather than volume. Adjusting for the effects, NII was flat quarter-over-quarter. We successfully managed pass through to increase only two percentage point to 30% driven mainly by Germany and Central Europe. Deposit volume stabilized Q-on-Q with growth in Germany and Central Europe and Eastern Europe while Italy reflected some rotation to BTPs. As our approach of prioritizing profitable client segments grows over volumes, moderates overall NII growth, our risk adjusted NII net of LLP remained above our cost of equity and is up 5% quarter-over-quarter. This focus on quality growth will continue to sustain superior profitability, organic capital generation and ultimately distributions. Our cost of risk which is structurally lower thanks to disciplined underwriting, improved asset quality and coverage, has contributed to the increase of our net revenues and the decrease of their volatility. This is a differentiated advantage which we intend to defend. Our stated cost of risk remained very low at 10 basis points mainly due to the continued writebacks primarily from Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia. We are reiterating our guidance for stated cost of risk below 20 basis points for 2024. Our default rate increased from circa 1% for the full 2023 to 1.3% is exclusively driven by two single names, one of which is mostly State guaranteed. The underlying default rate is at 0.9% down year-on-year. We have taken an average of \u20ac100 million of writebacks from back to bonis per quarter since Q1 2022 and this quarter is no exception. The circa \u20ac14 billion reduction in Stage 2 performing loans this quarter is largely due to good performance of underlying portfolio. We still have circa \u20ac1.8 billion of overlays to protect our performing portfolio, highest among peers. We have a better quality of NPE with above 70% of unlikely to pay and past due to total NPE. These demonstrate our strong asset quality combined with a conservative classification and provisioning policy. To report our fees more simply, we have changed their classification as detailed in the annex. Our fee base which accounts for 34% of total revenues today, 41% in Italy, grew 8% year-over-year ex-current account fee reduction in Italy and securitization cost. Investments were up 18%, Insurance 5%, driven by Non-Life up 12% and Payment up 11%. We are particularly pleased with the diversified and balanced nature of our fee streams. The positive momentum across all fee categories reflect our strategic investments in our product factories and renewed client appetite. We see continued potential for differentiated growth as we internalize and focus on capturing more share across each product value chain. A significant portion of this fee growth is locked-in and not dependent on market dynamics, rather managerial actions. We therefore aim to achieve \u20ac1.4 billion higher run rating fees in 2026 versus 2023. Cost management remains disciplined, supporting investment in our business and people, absorbing inflation and driving overall costs down while increasing our top line. We are continuing to streamline our organization, automating processes and reducing bureaucracy. We maintain a continued focus on hirings, training and remuneration as a direct route to enhancing our product factories and digital capability. As a result, our overall costs are down \u20ac170 million quarter-on-quarter and \u20ac16 million year-on-year, offsetting 3.4% inflation in our footprint this quarter by proactively acting to manage salary drift. Our cost/income ratio reached a leading 36.2% in Q1, down 3 percentage points year-over-year and 5.5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. Q1 was one of our strongest quarter yet in organic capital generation, 118 basis points or \u20ac3.4 billion in the quarter. This allowed us to accrue our full net income of \u20ac2.6 billion for distribution while further increasing our leading CET1 ratio by 35 basis points to 16.2% and retaining a best-in-class MDA buffer of almost 600 basis points. Our disciplined focus on quality net income growth complemented by an obsessive focus on operational and capital efficiency is key to maximizing profitability and organic capital generation, enabling outsized ordinary distribution whilst strengthening capital. This model is a competitive advantage for UniCredit. As I now take you through our regions and product factories, please note the differentiated strengths and value add that each one of our regions brings to the overall group as well as the value that the group brings to each one of them, making UniCredit better than the sum of its part. Let's move to Italy. Italy has again delivered outstanding result with its ROAC reaching 31% and profit before tax \u20ac1.6 billion, up 18%. Italy continues to drive the increase in our group's fees and insurance income and profitability of NII net of LLPs. Our consistent improvement in client focus and delivery across our three financial levers, have brought us closer to our ambition of becoming the bank of choice in Italy. Net revenue grew 7% year-on-year to \u20ac2.8 billion. NII was up 13% on rates and strong pass-through management. Cost of risk increased to 33 basis points driven by the full write-off of a single name credit which is largely State guaranteed. As such, net NII was up 14%. Fees were up 11% when excluding the current account fee reduction and securitization cost, 3% otherwise. They reached 41% of overall revenues including insurance results. The continuous search for operational and capital excellence drove cost to income ratio down to below 34% and net revenue to RWA up to 10.4% with RWAs decreasing 9% or \u20ac211 billion. Our people, clients and communities remain central to how we operate. It is testament to the support that we provide our people that we have been named top employer in Europe for the eighth year in a row. We launched Buddy, a full-service fully digital branch fully integrated in our distribution channels to provide our client with a choice of how, when and where they access us. We unveiled our Third Edition of UniCredit for Italy totaling \u20ac10 billion of additional credit. Germany, with its AAA rating and leading European player status, Germany has again delivered a strong result with ROAC exceeding 23%, up 4 percentage point year-over-year and profit before tax \u20ac800 million, up 24% year-on-year supported by a standout 7% reduction in their absolute cost base. Net revenue were \u20ac1.4 billion, only 4% below our stronger ever quarter in Q1 \u201923. Strong growth in high quality NII, investment and payment fees were unable to offset last year extremely high client demand for hedging and low cost of risk. NII was down 9%, however it is slightly positive, net of higher funding cost on market positioning which are counterbalanced in trading result. Cost of risk increased to 21 basis points driven by a single name. Investment fees were up 5%, payment fees 10%, fees overall down 3% due to the exceptional high base of hedging fees in Q1 2023. The continued search for operation and capital excellence drove Germany cost/income ratio down to 38.5% and net revenue to RWA up to 8.1% with RWAs decreasing \u20ac9 billion. Our sustained commitment to supporting entrepreneurship and inclusivity has seen us reaching circa 1700 beneficiaries in underserved areas with training and workshop during the first quarter. Central Europe. Central Europe continues to deliver on our ambition to become the leader in the region both in terms of franchise and performance. ROAC reached 22%, profit before tax rose 43% to \u20ac600 million. Net revenue grew 12% year-on-year to \u20ac1.1 billion as our approach to quality growth paid off. NII was up 11% on a strong rates environment, cost of risk remained negative reaching minus 20 basis points driven by continued writebacks. Net NII was up 15%. Fees were up 10% driven by investment products. Our cost increased only 1% despite high inflation leading to an improvement of our cost to income ratio to below 37%. Net revenue to RWAs improved to 7.4% with RWAs decreasing \u20ac600 million. Our innovation in the region continues with Hungary launching onemarkets adding to successful launches in Austria, Czech Republic and Slovenia. We launched end-to-end investment via mobile in Czech Republic and Slovakia and we have issued a \u20ac750 million Green Mortgage Covered Bond in Austria. Eastern Europe continues to increase its number of primary clients driving top-line growth while maintaining sustained operational and capital efficiency. ROAC reached 39%, profit before taxes was up 29%, lending at \u20ac500 million. Net revenue grew 16% year-over-year to \u20ac700 million. Our approach to quality growth resulted in a 23% increase in NII driven by strong commercial dynamics and a favorable rate environment. Cost of risk remained negative at minus 27 basis points. Net NII was up 18%. Fees were up 13%, thanks to our focus on payments, financing and advisory. Our cost growth of 4.8% in the region was half the average inflation level contributing to a decrease in our cost to income ratio to circa 30%. Net revenue to RWAs reached 10% with RWAs increasing 10% however half our gross revenues. This quarter, we were the joint lead manager on the \u20ac1.5 billion Zero Bond offering by Republic of Croatia and the first in the Bulgarian and Bosnia and Herzegovina markets to sign a Green Renewable Energy source. We continued the rollout of our onemarket funds with 16 funds in Bulgaria and launches in Romania. Our partnership with Alpha Bank in Romania and Greece is off to a strong start. Client Solution has delivered excellent results with gross revenues up 6% to \u20ac2.9 billion of which 65% were fees, up 8%, thanks to our focus on superior quality products for our banks while contributing to capital light growth. Our Corporate Solution revenue increased 4% to \u20ac1.4 billion whilst RWAs declined 12%. Within this Advisory & Financing generated strong fees particularly in DCM and M&A, up 23% year-over-year. Payment Solution revenue increased 1% to \u20ac600 million driven by payments, up 14% which were able to offset lower current account fees to our clients in Italy. Individual Solution revenues increased 14% to \u20ac900 million driven by investments up 18% to \u20ac600 million, thanks to demand for in-house products such as onemarkets, bonds and certificate leveraging on interest rate stabilization and product innovation. Insurance was up 5% to \u20ac300 million driven by Property and Casualty up 12% and a recovery in Life Insurance up 2% from a week 2023. As promised, we are going to now go through briefly a couple of deep dives, firstly, Corporate Solution. Our ambition for Corporate Solution is to become the go-to bank for small and mid-corporate clients in our core market. We're well on our way to achieving this. This business delivered \u20ac4.9 billion of revenues in 2023 of which 37% or \u20ac1.8 billion were fees but we expect to increase by \u20ac300 million by 2026. In Advisory & Financing which contributed \u20ac2 billion in 2023, we have grown our talent base and built an advisory and capital markets -- capital-light value-adding business to both balance and benefit from our financing. This is working well with fees reaching 25% of total revenues. We expect them to increase their weight to circa one-third by 2026. Our Trade & Correspondent Banking business which contributed \u20ac1.1 billion in 2023, is a leader in Europe where we secure twice the cross-border market share that we have in any domestic market as we accompany our clients end-to-end. We continue to invest in improving our client experience, digitalization and overall quality of the service with fees representing more than half of our revenues. Our Client Risk Management Solution which delivered \u20ac1.8 billion in 2023 are designed for SME clients to whom we provide targeted offering on rates, commodities and effects. We remain focused on improving our client's connectivity and client-driven business. Fees account for 42% of total revenues. We shall reduce RWA usage and cost further through to our trading engine centralization project. Let's move to Payment Solutions. Payment Solution is a core area of investment and growth for the Group. It offers transactional payment, issuing and acquiring and current account to our 15 million clients across our 13 banks in Europe with the ambition to be every European client's first bank of choice for payment. We are well advanced in consolidating Payment Solutions into a centre of excellence, creating a united factory alongside Individual and Corporate Solutions that can provide best-in-class products and growth to our 13 banks. The business delivered \u20ac2.5 billion of revenue in 2023 of which circa 90% were fees that we expect to increase by \u20ac300 million by 2026. We are ideally positioned to be a gateway to innovation, leveraging partnership, global platform and group data intelligence. Our strong payments DNA and flexible technology make us a standout in the market. We are the number one EU bank for transactional payment with a cross-border payment market share of over three times that of intra-country payments. The business delivered \u20ac1.3 billion of revenue in 2023 of which 82% were fees which we expect to grow at a 4% CAGR out to 2026. Our inherent success factors include advanced international payments, sophisticated cash management and treasury-related solutioning FX, rates and commodities and our ability to leverage our unique pan-European network. We have three key strategic priorities here further boosting our leading position in the pan-European payment space by expanding our capabilities in mature markets to other CE and EE countries. Second, maintaining our domestic leadership in each market by extending and enhancing our product offering. Third, evolving towards a truly client-centric approach to counter emerging threats and increase our share in the business. In both Issuing and Acquiring we are in the top three leading positions in six European markets including Italy. We intend to further strengthen our position in all our 13 markets expanding our capabilities and exploiting digital payments especially in CE and EE. The business delivered business delivered \u20ac500 million of revenues in 2023 of which 91% were fees which we expect to grow at a CAGR of 8% out to 2026. In Issuing we are positioned to win in the market with 13 banks having issuing licenses performing over 5.5 million pure POS or cashless transactions per day in 2023. We have a direct issuing license model in all markets and we've insight from extensive card transaction data through a highly diversified product offering including consumer and commercial cards across prepaid debit and credit card products. In Acquiring we operate across 10 countries with a principal license model performing 5.75 million POS transaction per day in 2023. In-house acquiring is a cornerstone of our strategy which gives us a competitive edge. To further enhance our offering, we're also revamping this business proposition and product offering becoming a merchant acquiring bank with fully integrated Acquiring Solutions. Overall, we have the potential to be the standout player in the payment industry and are committed to meeting that ambition and providing excellent services to our clients. UniCredit Unlocked has already fundamentally transformed our bank laying the foundation for sustainable and profitable future. This has led to UniCredit delivering 13 consecutive quarters of profitable growth taking us to the top of the industry in terms of EPS, DPS and tangible book value per share growth, return on tangible equity, organic capital generation, distribution, operational and capital efficiency and CET1. All while continuing to invest to propel our future results and continuing to accumulate significant buffers to further protect our delivering and our distribution in the future. These include \u20ac1.5 billion non-operating items, \u20ac1.8 billion in overlays and more than \u20ac6.5 billion of excess capital going forward. We are far from being finished. We're determined to achieve our long-term ambition of excellence and have the levers to do so. We have made substantial progress in making UniCredit more efficient and effective. We shall now accelerate our journey towards a truly client-centric organization serving them as efficiently and effectively as possible. Our strategy has a dual focus. The first pillar is our operating machine. We're continuously simplifying our organization, streamlining our processes and operations and upgrading our technology. This supports our second pillar, our commercial machine. Firstly, this means continuing to empower, motivate, train and focus our people on understanding and addressing client needs. Secondly, it is developing and fully integrating alternative distribution channels to ensure that clients can access that when, how and where they want. And finally, it is about ensuring the seamless delivery of top-tier products provided through our factories and best-in-class partners via our integrated distribution channel. Going forward, we focus on continuing to expand our fee base, defending and further enhancing the profitability of our NII net of provision and the stability of our trading operations. This ensures a well-rounded and resilient top-line. Our capital accretive, NII net of LLPs, exceeds the cost of equity in its own right with low volatility. We believe to be one of the only two banks in Europe in our peer group that have delivered this much. Our quality backbook and higher strategic flexibility on volumes, along with our strong replicating portfolio, shall partly offset rates headwind and the continued compression of Russia. Our fees have substantially grown in importance and now provide a strong starting base, stable and diversified. We now have an improved mix compared to our peers, with fees at 34% of revenues and strong lever with which to grow our fees by a further \u20ac1.4 billion out to 2026, thanks to past investment and clear action to further unlock our in-house product factories. By integrating these diverse revenue streams, we are creating a high-quality top-line unmatched amongst peers and one of the critical factors to superior sustainable return on tangible equity, organic capital generation and growth. Our ability to maintain industry-leading operational and capital excellence is critical to delivering on our profitability and organic capital generation ambition and ultimately distributions. We currently rank first in cost to income ratio, cost of risk and capital efficiency. Our absolute cost base has been consistently reduced despite inflationary pressures while investing for the benefit of the business in line with UniCredit Unlocked. We have taken significant integration costs, preparing the ground for continued future cost reduction, leveraging ongoing simplification efforts. A decade of de-risking, vigilant origination and continued conservative provisioning have resulted in a structurally lower and much less volatile cost of risk, which we trust we will be able to maintain below 20 basis points this year and within the 20 basis points to 25 basis points over the cycle, leveraging the release of our \u20ac1.8 billion of overlays. We have improved our capital efficiency since UniCredit Unlocked, delivering now best-in-class organic capital generation to support sustainable and significant distribution without denting CET1. Our discipline is now embedded and we expect it to continue unabated. Our unique BNL buffer substantially derisk our ability to deliver our bottom line and combined with the usage of or return of our excess capital shall support greater total distributions. We are upgrading our net profit guidance to in excess of \u20ac8.5 billion versus our previous guidance of broadly in line and you all know what my personal ambition is. This is driven by a strong Q1 which puts us ahead of our run rate for the year and a better outcome on systemic charges which we now expect to be around \u20ac400 million lower than \u201923 or circa \u20ac200 million better than we had anticipated. Given our healthier profitability and most importantly, organic capital generation and excess capital return commitment, we are upgrading our expected 2024 total distribution to circa \u20ac8.6 billion in line with 2023. This continues to represent the highest total distribution yield in the industry. Accordingly we are accruing 100% of net profit in the first quarter. Our dividend payout remains at 40% of net profit or circa \u20ac3.4 billion. Our 2024 calendar distribution could now exceed \u20ac10 billion. We aim to commence the first tranche of a remainder of a 2023 share buyback as soon as possible after results. There will be more tranches soon thereafter. We are confident that in the next three years we will continue to offer a compelling investment opportunity across strong growth of EPS and DPS, profitability and best-in-class total distribution underpinned by organic capital generation and excess capital deployment or return, no later than 2027. In the event that our excess capital cannot be deployed and is therefore returned in full to our shareholders, we anticipate based on our profitability an organic capital generation assumption that our total annual average distribution \u201924 to \u201926 will be either equal in \u201924 or above \u20ac8.6 billion in \u201925 and \u201926. As such, we should be able to return in this event half of our current market cap to our shareholders within the next three years. Should any of the excess capital be deployed, the level of total annual distribution shall remain best-in-class but depend in their amount on the return on those investments. We confirm that traditional bank acquisition shall be executed only if they fit strategically and if their POS synergies return compare favorably with those of our share buyback. Our transformation efforts have delivered consistent outstanding results across all KPIs, surpassing our peers. As of Q1, we are the leader in terms of EPS, DPS and tangible book per share growth, return on tangible equity, cost/income ratio, CET1, organic capital generation and expected 2024 distribution yield. And we're not done as our guidance for \u201925 and \u201926 and in general for the next three years demonstrates. We remain an even more attractive investment opportunity as our past performance and future prospects are still not reflected in our evaluation. Both our price to earnings and price to distribution multiples remained at a substantial discount to not only top peers but also to the sector particularly when adjusted for excess capital and the comfort provided by our lines of defense. Before I open to question, I would like to leave you with three key messages. One, this quarter has once again demonstrated the effectiveness of our UniCredit Unlock strategy. Our metrics of growth, profitability, and distribution set a benchmark for the industry. Two, looking forward we have plenty of runway left and are excited at the opportunity to show what we can do when rates and cost of risk normalize. In addition, we shall maintain a distribution yield and strategic optionality that are unmatched. Thirdly, our valuation is far from reflecting the above and we remain focused on continuing to deliver the results and distribution but will ultimately drive it to where it should be. Thank you everyone. And I now open for questions."

        "speaker": "Ignacio Cerezo ",
        "text": "Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Can I ask you for a little more color in terms of the breakdown of net profit growth in absolute terms and the share count reduction over \u201925 and \u201926? And you seem to be suggesting a strong EPS growth. Again I'm looking for a little bit of color basically in terms of the absolute versus the per share. And then the second one is, maybe you can give us a little bit of information around how much seasonality the fee number has included this quarter. This is very strong everywhere. I mean I've seen that the gross fee [indiscernible] have increased I think from \u20ac9 billion to \u20ac14 billion. So just trying to understand the path of the fee line actually through the year? Thank you very much."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel ",
        "text": "I'll start and then Stefano will continue, Ignacio. So in terms of EPS and DPS what is which? I think we have purposely gone on EPS and DPS because it all depends on the speed and significance of the rates reduction and how the pass-through is managed. So we anticipate to be able to absorb the headwinds but the speed at which that happens vis-a-vis the offsetting levers, i.e. fees, i.e. cost, i.e. cost of risk which is going to normalize and the release of some of our buffers is at this point in time difficult to predict exactly. But suffice to say that we intend to defend our line of profitability at the moment at least and hopefully once we normalize, grow it further from there. With respect to the fees what I would say is that everyone has had very strong fees in this quarter. A lot is driven by clients moving in anticipation of rate reductions. It's difficult again to understand how much of that move will continue into second and third. I personally would not multiply by four, if I were you. But there is definitely a very positive trend going forward on rebalancing from other investments that were let's say preferred while we were in a higher interest rate environment to investment that are more in line to what it was before the rising rate. I would also highlight that in our question, that goes back to your first question, timing is important because for example our fees next year will benefit from internalization of insurance. Our fees in asset management are benefiting by internalization of some of the value change as we develop our in-house products. That's timing. Our fees in Payments are benefiting by the rollout of a MasterCard agreement and our agreement with Nexi and other initiatives. So it's a question of timing between what our idiosyncratic industrial transformation of the factories and of the very fee engine occurs and at the same time how fast the NII comes down and to which level due to the rates environment. But maybe Stefano can add to that."

        "speaker": "Stefano Porro ",
        "text": "Yes, if you look the performance year-on-year on our fees, you should take into consideration that we have a double digit growth on Property and Casualty, and Payment fees. Such a double digit growth in a way is sustainable. I mean it's connected to the activity of the clients but having said that, is more sustainable than what we can expect in relation to the investment fees in the sense that we still have a good pace in relation to the investment fees but a part of the trend that we saw is deriving from the rebalancing of the portfolio of the clients. So a part of that should normalize during the course of the year."

        "text": "Hi, morning, thanks for taking my questions. My first one is just on net revenue guidance which is unchanged at \u20ac22.5 billion. It looks like your cost of risk is definitely running better and revenues in general. I take your point on investment fees and part of that is, could save a bit in the next two quarters but Q1 is a very strong performance in trading as well. So just trying to think about what does that mean for net interest income and if you could just give us a bit of color of what are the moving parts and if there is any concerns or from the deposit pass-through increasing a bit higher maybe? And then my second question is on M&A. Thanks for the update but just kind of wondering a little bit so the criteria are clear. Now just thinking, the horizon is 2027 or should we -- could we consider something a bit earlier than that? I mean what are you thinking here in terms of also areas of interest, M&A wise? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel ",
        "text": "Delphine, if I bought all my shares this year the market could not absorb it, so now seriously. So I'll frame a little bit and then I'll pass to Stefano. Let me start with the second one. So we said at least 2027 and I think we are committing given our expectation with respect to net profit and organic capital generation more than committing, we're guiding to exceed \u20ac8.6 billion in distribution. So we have a buffer. I mean you can do \u20ac6.5 billion in -- up to the end of \u201927 or you can do it a little bit earlier but that should give confidence that total distribution can be supported. And how much every year will depend on a number of factors including how well we do on the ordinary and how well we do and what do we do in deployment of capital and other things. But we have set a line of trying to beat the \u201923 distributions. More generally and then I'll pass it to Stefano. I had that question before, why are -- what is our guidance and what has changed? I think what we have just done is before we were broadly in line now we say in excess of \u20ac8.5 billion, so we have broadly in line may mean plus minus \u20ac200 million. We've cut the downside and we said we're not going to be below \u20ac8.5 billion and actually above and we've kept the upside, that's what we have done. So if you look at Q1, one thing is certain, the results are well ahead of trend line that we expected and they have given us the confidence to be more secure that the downside is -- that we can manage with any downside. Now we're only in Q1, so we're not going to give you more than that. In terms of fees, we expect the same -- similar performance to what we were saying. In terms of NII, at the moment we have more encouraging results. But let's see what happens not only in the second but in the second part of a year when rates should decline and how fast they decline. So there are still quite a lot of moving parts so I would say that the general message is given where we are and what we're seeing we have cut the bottom and we have left open the upside."

        "speaker": "Stefano Porro ",
        "text": "So integrating on net interest income, so key elements, one is rates, a few basis points less rates in Q1. All-in-all, the average of \u201924 should be higher than the average of \u201923. This should positively impact the net interest income but as rate [indiscernible] in the second part of the year there will be a reduction of the rate so from that perspective is important to bear that in mind. Replicating portfolio contribution is slightly better than the expectation, so for the full year in comparison to 2023 will be above \u20ac400 million, so that's a positive side. Russia contribution negative, so concerning the leveraging ongoing you can expect few hundred million less net interest income in the next three quarters. Pass-through, I have to say, pass-through it's a couple of percentage up so we are at 30%. We are expecting to close the year with a average that is slightly above 30% so we then an exit Q4 close to 35%. So all-in-all, this should negatively contribute to net interest income, however as commented before the two positive news, rates on one end and the replicating portfolio contribution on the other end. Volume side, we do expect during the course of 2024 an exit level of the lending stock lower than the beginning of the year mainly for the trend that we are seeing here in Italy. It will be different for 2025 with regards to client rate trend on the lending side so far so good, so the repricing is ongoing and especially on the new lending production but it's not such to have a meaningful contribution to net interest income in comparison to what we've gathered for."

So one, the timing of the execution of internalization, the second one is the timing connected to the interaction with the regulator that will start in advance.

The first one, can you give us an update in terms of what you are seeing both from competition and from your client base when it comes to the positive pricing, maybe with a commentary across your key geographies, I think you have slightly moved up your pass-through assumptions for the year. I am trying to understand if it is a function of the change in assumptions on interest rates or actual changes in the deposit remuneration in absolute terms? That\u2019s my first question. Secondly, you have besides your local subsidiary in Russia, which is liquid, well capitalized. I think you were allowed to upstream some dividends, if I am not wrong. And you\u2019ve talked about the risk in targets of above 10% a year, what is the end game for you in Russia now?

Some comments in relation to the region, so Italy we are at 14.5%, in terms of deposit pass-through, we are up from 13.8%. Overall, the deposit mix is still tilted towards site deposit, so we have 96% of site deposit, so there is fundamentally no contribution to term. There is a not meaningful change in the behavior of the clients and from that perspective, yes, the composition is there especially on term offer but it is not such to meaningfully impact the pass-through. In Germany, the deposit composition is a different one because the site depo, to give the flavor is around 55%, so it is a completely different one. There the competition on term deposit is different, it is there. In Germany, there was an increase of the deposit pass-through and as a consequence also of the overall client rate, the deposit pass-through move up from 41% to around 43%. Central Europe, we move from 41% in Q4 to around 44%. Main country where there is an increased level of pass-through competition is Austria in line with the market rates. And Austria move from close to 40% to around 43%, Eastern Europe was 24%, now we are at 27%. All-in-all the trend of the pass-through is in line with the expectation as later the competition is higher especially in Austria for we see a stabilization in relation especially on the Corporate side across the board. There is still some movement on the Individual side especially in private banking and then we are not expecting a minimum change in the pattern during the course of Q2 to be seen the velocity of the repricing especially in the euro area when rates will start moving down in the second half of the year."

So we consider that the right way to go and we expect that the cross-border exposure that remains will practically be dealt with or reversed by the end of 2025. With respect to the local exposure, our local exposure is down 67% over the last two years or so and we are continuing to compress decisively and we will continue to do that in the next few years and you should expect an accelerated decline. With respect to the end game, I think all we can do is do well what we control. We control the level of our business, we control what we do, how we protect against sanctions, compliance events, etc., etc., that we do. Obviously, if there were an opportunity to sell it or if there were an opportunity to further accelerate our disengagement, we would. At this point in time and certainly vis-a-vis where we were two years ago, the impact on capital and P&L from that exit has been vastly reduced and I think we continue to do that. We are already factoring in the numbers that we are giving you, which is why you should look, considering that, the trends. With that in mind, obviously the compression of Russia is taking out NIIs, is taking out bottom line and correctly so, but the decline is not all underlying business, which means if you take Russia away, the underlying business is performing better than the numbers you are looking at now."

The first one is on cost and how should we think about cost going from here after the four months that you have delivered in 1Q? If you could break up that in the main geography, that would be great. The second one is on fees and looking to the disclosure that you have given on payments, thanks very much for that. I was just trying to better understand how do you see the current accounts fees going forward and how that \u20ac300 million growth in fees by 2026 will be split within these three buckets that you have given us? Thank you."

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel ",
        "text": "So, cost. As I said, I think that by now the entire UniCredit is obsessively focused on efficiency. And we are guiding to cost below \u20ac9.5 billion this year, which means we will have had, effectively in the next three years, declining costs gradually, orderly, every quarter and I think we are going to try to keep it that way for as long as we can. There will be, in terms of absolute decline, a bar at some point, but we're not at that bar now and that allows us to do the following things. One, absorb inflation, salary drift and other. So, one that. Two, absorb investments that we're making in hiring new people, in training, in technology, etc., etc. And three, to obviously improve the jaws and the cost/income ratio to a greater extent than people that are maybe more focused on the top-line. We focus on both as obsessively and we will continue to do that. What happens by geography obviously is different. I mean, we have geographies that are, let's call them stable. Those geographies are rationalizing cost to a greater extent than geographies who have higher inflation and are growing much faster, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, where due to inflation and much faster growth, the ability to keep costs negative is not there. But if you look at the dynamics of growth of top line inflation versus cost, we are creating a positive gap everywhere. If I look at fees, I would just say on current account. As you know, we cut our current account fees to Italian clients in April 2023. So going forward, the comparison is for like-for-like. So in the second, third and fourth quarter and first of this year, we've always had to tell you, look, the underlying fees are these, but because we cut the current account fees to our Italian clients, they look less. From the second quarter onward, the comparison will be like-for-like. So while we're not changing our guidance for fees, and you know what it is, when you look at the growth, you should look at underlying because the current account fees are there and they're not going to move. But I don't know if Stefano wants to give more."

So these are the two engine that will contribute to the \u20ac300 million growth."

Do you think that there has been a change of perception of delivery positioning from both competitors and clients and now you are a forefront for growing more and this is something that is well received from clients? The second one is still on the [indiscernible]. You have made several changes and investment and refraction in this part. I am aware of the -- among the contractor negotiation and the insurance coming into place next year. But is there any other investments or reshaping that you would like to do into this business? Or it's just about now taking the benefit of everything that has been done so far? Thank you."

        "text": "Thank you, Azzurra. So Client Solutions. Let's start with where we are. I think this is one of the question you should have for Alpha Bank in Greece. I think that demonstrates that the quality, the level, the appropriateness and the way it's designed of our solution across investments, across insurance, across payments, across trade finance, and I can continue and across that integral market, of course, are done in such a way that they are particularly targeted to the clients of a commercial banks, i.e. small and medium corporates, affluent clients, private banking, that stream. And indeed we are very pleased and I think they are very pleased of what can be done with our factories in third parties, which fundamentally means that they are adding value, otherwise they wouldn't be making it. The same I would say if you look at Central and Eastern Europe and you take specific countries, I don't know, Bulgaria, Bosnia, it would be difficult for them to have the breadth and quality of, for example, investment products that they can instead get because we have centralized factories. So if you look at the rollout of onemarket, in many of these countries that rollout does not replace existing products, it just is what it is because now we can provide a product that maybe our partners would not find the rationale of a critical mass to deploy for one market alone. We are actually by leveraging group size, providing our smaller countries or countries that were mainstream asset managers, insurance companies, etc., etc., are not present. So I think it's definitely value added and I think in those countries we're definitely increasingly associated with quality fees, quality solution and other streams beyond just lending. And you can see it in the growth rates. They are growth rates from a low base but there are high growth rates. I think in the mind of clients there are a number of things. I would say that in Italy if I take P&C away from CPI, it was something we were practically absent three years ago and now I would say that most of our growth in Non-Life is that because you have noticed that the volumes in mortgages and other products are not growing. So the growth, where does it come from? Other products which were practically at zero three years ago and that is well known to our individual clients, that is also well known in the targeted offering we have for SME clients. So I would say you need to ask for what clients but I think the numbers indicate that it is working. I think in terms of Amundi and other contracts, first of all, please do not -- when you look at all of these things, so Amundi, when you look at internalization of insurance, when you look at that, there is a delta but the delta is not 100% meaning. If I am telling you that we are internalizing in excess of 73%, 74% of the value chain in asset management and we are aiming to go to 82% and we are doing that without producing but by distributing third party and packaging and improving the performance of what we distribute, we cannot go to 100% and in any case the delta is between 75% and 82%. The delta is not between 0 and 100%. If you take Life Insurance, we are already being paid for distribution. As we pull in Life Insurance, we will benefit from the underwriting of the product but the distribution is already within our fee base. So don't do 0-100% but they will contribute. So one, Asset Management, you are seeing it in let's say in-flight with onemarket and the other initiatives along this line. Two, Insurance will occur next year and you will see Life Insurance coming in-house during the course of next year. Three, on Payments, there are a number of initiatives which are completely along the same lines of what we have done in Asset Management and Insurance. So we look for the right partners, in this case for example MasterCard. We tend to create a partnership, so not multiple renegotiated every time but one contract, one partnership, mutual investment in technology, in product, in growth and usually better economic outcome because the stability of the partnership makes it clear to both sides that we don't want to put it in risk. So you're seeing some of this already progressing in payments. There will be other initiatives in payment that are not public yet, that we're going to roll out and that are going to accrete and move us into that direction. I would say that in Payment, especially transactional payment, the difference is that that is already in-house and there will be significant investment in technology to further secure not only the service and our leadership but also our ability to cross-sell a number of products that we can do when we go end-to-end between a country and another. And I can continue with all the factories but so if you take advisory and capital market, we have no ambition to become a leading global investment bank but in our client base, in our mid-cap client base and also small-cap, we want to be the dominant player. And therefore the level of service and what we do is focused on getting our advisory and capital market to work tightly together with our banks to attack those segment of clients where global investment bank don't reach because they are too small and local player reach but don't have the ability to serve because they cannot rebuild the same level of service. That is the philosophy we're going across and I do absolutely believe that it's more and more clear to clients that if they need advice on certain things we're there for them and you see it in the numbers of advisor and capital markets, for example."

We can all work out what your financial hurdles are, but could you just explain what makes a good strategic fit for UniCredit, especially with the strategy that you've laid out? Is it a type of loan book? Is it capital-light, a certain type of client base, and where do you think you could add something to a deal? And the second one is on risk-weighted assets, based on another strong reduction from portfolio management, including securitizations. What further measures do you think you can undertake here? And maybe you can give us an idea of what is included in the excess capital guide to more than \u20ac6.5 billion to 2025 in terms of RWA? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel ",
        "text": "On M&A, it's a little bit, every time I have this answer, it's broad. Okay? So I could make, I don't know if you consider that M&A, but I could make an investment in a fintech that provides us a technology platform to accelerate what we're doing in a certain segment of business. That usually is not large, but it doesn't have the same multiple and the same profile as a traditional bank M&A. But in our investment profile, when we look at return on investment and IRR, it needs to hurdle. Everything we do needs to hurdle. Hurdle means that when people tell you it's strategic, it's usually to convince you to do something that does not return above the cost of equity and therefore it\u2019s strategic. In our case, you're never going to hear that. So we're going to tell you it's strategic because it makes sense that we develop our platform with this technology on this and it hurdles over the life of the investment and we're very thorough in looking at that. We could look at, for example, the metrics for internalizing Life Insurance are different from the one of a traditional bank. But I would say that many of you will tell me that especially because of the Danish compromise, the return on the capital employed is a no brainer and therefore you should be doing it. But if I look at straight P's, P's in insurance are higher than in banks. So but the return on investment makes all of the sense and given that it doesn't consume almost any capital, it becomes a good investment for us and so on and so forth. So if I take a traditional bank, so the same kind of overall, then it's quite easy and if I can buy an overall bank, meaning UniCredit at under seven times earnings, it's very difficult for me to justify you all and our investors that it's a good idea if post synergies it costs me 10. So we will do it only if it beats our share buybacks. But then more generally, what are we looking at? Anything that strengthens the franchise. So we could look at things, so in Insurance, as we're internalizing insurance, strengthen the franchise. We can look at things in technology to accelerate the rollout of certain ideas that we have. That is just the beginning, but we could do other things in that area. We can look at traditional banks if they fit. And the question is, we all take a step back and we say, okay, does that increase the value of our franchise, does that create over time a better return than either not doing anything or buying back our shares? If the answer is yes, we do it across the board. Because you asked me for metrics, I have to refer to traditional banks, but otherwise I would give you a long table with, if it's a fintech X, if it's an insurance Y, and that becomes a little bit ridiculous. With respect to RWAs and the excess capital, and Stefan is going to guide you in further details, the excess of over \u20ac6.5 billion already embeds the impact from Balfour and still keeps us ahead of 13%. There are debates as to whether ahead of 13% plus Balfour is the right number or not, but the \u20ac6.5 billion is above 13% fully including Balfour and all the regulatory headwinds that we know of at this time. With respect to what we're going to do on, let's say, more ordinarily RWAs, the same. Which means deploy our capital, therefore our RWAs above the cost of equity, and therefore make sure that in as much as possible our NII net of provision, which is where we deploy our capital, exceeds the cost of equity, critical in a bank, to provide profitability. Profitability, not net profit, profitability return on equity and distribution, and not destroy them. And secondly, increase the weight of fees, because obviously fees are zero RWAs. So the blended then beats in terms of return on tangible and distribution. That's looking forward. Looking backwards, which is what over time is reducing and then shall almost disappear, is the management of our backbook to make sure that the entire backbook portfolio fits the metric of exceeding the cost of equity. As we said many times, Britta, we were, let's say, 30%, 40% was at that level before. Now we are over 60%, I think it is, or 70%, sorry. We're going to go 80%, 85%, 90% but we\u2019re never going to be 100%. Nobody has 100%. So that will over time decrease, and at that point we will be reliant on the profitability and the capital generation of our NII net of provision and the fees, plus the capital impact from \u201926 onward of our DTAs, which will start contributing and adding again to our capital generation above and beyond what is ordinary and organic."

        "text": "So some data points, securitization and active portfolio management. So we're assuming to execute a few billions of securitization, both in \u201924 and \u201925, so on top of what we have already executed. Active portfolio management action, the same. Do consider that the overall stock of risk-weighted assets related to EVA-negative clients on the corporate side is around \u20ac20 billion at group level. So as a matter of fact, part of that will be improved working on the revenue side, so cross-selling and so on. Part of that is likely going to be not rollover, so will contribute to the active portfolio management action in \u201924 and \u201925. With regards to the regulatory impact in relation to Basel IV, let's say last estimate is between 85 basis points and 290 basis points, is mainly operational risk. So it's around 70 basis point operational risk. Do take into consideration that that is mainly connected to our revenues, so the more we do revenues, the more we have a risk-weighted asset and operational risk. And the more we are reducing risk-weighted assets, the more the business point impact is higher. So all-in-all, the reason why the impact on Basel IV is slightly more is because we are betting on revenues and we are betting on risk-weighted asset management. Okay? So nothing wrong. Finally, in relation to the business dynamic, we are not expecting a meaningful contribution of business-driven risk-weighted assets during the course of 2024, for what we have commented before in relation to the lending trend. While in \u201925 and \u201926, considering that we are expecting a reversal of the stock of lending, meaning going back to growth, we are currently assuming also some risk-weighted asset inflation that are in from business dynamics. But as related by Andrea, all has been taken into consideration for what we have gathered for in relation to capital plan."

Can you just remember us what you are doing on this front and how you are leveraging your pan-European footprint on the technology? Second one, I was wondering, since the business plan this year comes to a conclusion, I'm talking about UniCredit Unlocked, are you planning a new business plan presentation, I don't know, sometimes in the last quarter or maybe early next year? Thank you."

      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "As most of my colleagues at UniCredit know, we are never done. So we just keep on moving the boundaries out. I would say that for UniCredit Unlocked, too early to say. I don't think that UniCredit Unlocked is over, meaning UniCredit Unlocked is an approach, it's a vision, it's a strategy and it's the constant pursuit of certain KPIs across revenue growth, sustainable and profitable across operational excellence with cost/income ratio at the best end of the industry across capital excellence, across all of these things to be able to sustainably return on tangible above -- much above and beyond our cost of equity and to create a model that is highly cash generative so that we can reward our investors more than the benchmark. So if you look at that then when we announced UniCredit Unlocked we were all about fees and then what happened, we had a war two months later and we have rates going up a year later or less. And therefore our plan was all about NII pass-through and building without forgetting that we needed to build further fees for when that passed. And I think what you're seeing going forward regardless of what we will do with a new plan or not, is a continuation of that adapted it for an environment that is changing. So it is difficult to think that we can substantially increase as we have done in the last three years, our cost to income, our cost of risk, our capital efficiency. Difficult, we can hold but difficult. If you look at emphasis, our emphasis is how the other engine and a half, which is fees and some trading, can offset as much as possible the impact from normalization of rates and cost of risk on NII. That's the challenge, if we can do that while keeping the rest going back to what Ignacio was saying at the beginning, we will be able to stabilize our net profit and most importantly, our return on tangible well ahead of 15% and then as volume come back, grow from there and maintain a more normalized orderly growth from that level. We will keep the surprise as to where we do and when we do on Investor Day. With respect to technology and then I'll pass it to Stefano, I think the direction is very clear. So direction number one is, in as much as possible and all of you probably realize how difficult that is to have -- the ambition is to have at some point in time one technology for the entire group. Why? Not because I particularly like it or not like, it is because you need to go back to that. If we were to be able to do that we would have a scale advantage in technology equivalent to a bank that is simple in onemarket. So that is worth a lot of efficiency, it's worth speed, it's worth client journey, it\u2019s worth everything. But that is not easy. I think how many bank even have one technology in one market and we're saying we want one technology in 13. So it is a journey, it is a mindset that when we develop things, we're trying to get them to converge. But we also realize that if I wanted to do that and that was my sole objective, my 13 banks would stop because they would not be able to roll out all the things they're rolling out. And in a number of countries we are a technology leader and we have taken technology to a very high level, take Croatia, take Bulgaria and we're not going to delay them because of the group product. We are going to try to get it to converge. The second thing is, thank God, sometimes you're lucky, when you wait and you're the second mover, cloud is allowing an acceleration and it's a lot easier to do and it's a lot cheaper to do and will allow us to go in that direction. But as Ali and I discuss all the time, the way we look at technology is, okay this is better from a technology standpoint. But better needs to deliver, better revenue, better cost, better client experience, and outcome. If it doesn't, we're a private enterprise and we're going to look at it in a different way. So that is the philosophy and that is happily applied by Stefano who will give you more details about it."

        "text": "Thank you, Andrea. So let's start from some data, some financials. So in relation to the IT investment in the Unlock plan, the environmental IT investment, I hold the amount of IT cash out was around \u20ac2.8 billion. We are in line with that, last year we've invested more than \u20ac700 million in terms of IT investment cash out and this year will be more than that. We are doing initiatives, let's say, on one end on efficiency, on the other end on change and effectiveness. On efficiency, clearly we have a renegotiation contract and we will negotiate contract with our partners and we are also in-sourcing people and skills, right? In order, let's say, with the ultimate goal to keep under our control the inflation that is absolutely there also when we are dealing with IT cost. With regards to the change, we are fundamentally investing on fundamentally four pillars. Cyber security, the amount that we are investing on cyber security is the same, slightly growing. Then we have the experience platform that are fundamentally connected with our key strategic priorities, i.e. were invested in the client experience platform, for example, consumer financing. But that Andrea highlighted before is one of them and we are doing the same also on Insurance and we will do on Payment. So this type of client experience digital investment are totally in line with our key strategic priorities towards clients. Then we have data, so we will have investment in relation especially to the improvement of data taking into consideration how much data is important, let's say also to run the business and to properly serve the clients. And then as highlighted by Andrea, we are also locating a part of the investment to cloud, meaning fundamentally to the infrastructure with the same goal. So in this case is partly efficiency because we can also harmonize and reducing the normal application that we have but on the other hand we can also speed an increase in the speed of delivery properly shifting from mainframe to cloud over the next years."

        "text": "Good morning, everyone. So just a quick one to begin with. So regarding the commitment to return the excess capital later than 2027, can I just check, does that mean distribution in relation to \u201927, i.e. the dividends and buybacks conducted in 2028? Or that it's all done and dusted by the end of December \u201927? And then second, on M&A, the move higher I guess in valuation multiples across the sectors has in theory made the backdrop a bit more supportive for M&A. But again, you've previously talked about the need to achieve alignment between willing buyers and willing sellers. And if we look around at recent developments in the space, it looks like that alignment can still be a stumbling block. So perhaps to what extent do you think the delivery of UniCredit Unlocked is now a key support in enabling you to achieve that alignment in the future, i.e. to convince the seller that you can deliver on integration and operational improvements ahead of what they might be able to achieve on a standalone basis?"
      },

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Okay, so the capital return, end of \u201927 done and dusted and I said, at least or later, sorry, latest. So we will gauge the speed based on everything else to be able to deliver compelling distribution in the meantime. Then M&A, I think there I mean from our point of view, we have the following factors. Point number one, well, we have and we're very confident and excited about a great runway going forward. We have moved firmly from a probably something that looked more like a restructuring story, therefore with jumps in net income doubling and doubling or whatever it is to more of a normalized high value bank that obviously by definition is closer to reaching its excellence outcome and therefore has less internal delta than what we had in 2021. Now it's a higher quality delta, you have a contribution from valuation all of these things. And we think that relative to the sector we're going to perform better in terms of that runway and that trend line significantly better but it is less than the jumps we've made every year in the last three. So that means that when we look at benchmarks and when we look at that M&A has a benchmark that is easier to match. The second thing that has happened is that I do believe that not only we are more credible in our ability to extract value from a banking franchise but beside the credibility we're confident internally and capable of replicating what we've done on our franchise on others. And we think that that is a competitive advantage and we think that those two things bring our ability to extract synergies above and beyond what is the average on a spreadsheet, quite tangible and quite [grown]. And that's the second positive. The third positive is to be seen and that is when the tide goes down and the substantial tailwind from rates and cost of risks normalizes, I think we will see a differentiated performance between the banks that have tried to crystallize 110% of that tailwind and therefore did relatively little to look at afterwards and the banks who have invested a lot, re-engineered a lot and taken some of the benefits from that tailwind to invest further in improving themselves that, that will be more capable to absorb the shock and then grow from there at a differentiated level. We believe we are in the second category. We believe that if some of the targets are in the first, it will create a better alignment in valuation to fundamentals. So if you get a better alignment evaluation to fundamental, if we can extract more value and we are at a point where our credibility and our capability of doing it has increased, M&A is more probable. With respect to targets, I think that if I asked any of you what are the targets or possible target in any market? We should -- we would all end up with the same list not only for UniCredit but more generally. So the question is, as you said, opportunity and opportunity is there a willing buyer and a willing seller and on the other hand are the economics and the ability to execute make sense. If you're getting those two but I do think we're going in a direction where probably the opportunity becomes more probable."

    "transcript": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before I hand over to Magda Palczynska, Head of Investor Relations, a reminder that today's call is being recorded. Madam, you may begin.\nMagda Palczynska: Good morning, and welcome to UniCredit's Second Quarter and First Half 2024 Results Conference Call. Andrea Orcel, our CEO, will take you through the results. This will be followed by a Q&A session with Andrea and Stefano Porro, our CFO. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I hand over to Andrea.\nAndrea Orcel: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. It is with great pleasure that we announce our second quarter and first half 2024 results. This mark the historic achievement for UniCredit in its journey to set a new benchmark for banking, 14 consecutive quarters of profitable growth, delivering a record quarter and a record first half. These results are a testament to the unwavering commitment of our team with disciplined execution of our long-term vision and strategy and our dedication to creating value for all our stakeholders over time. The track record we have built in the last 3.5 years is undeniable. We are confident that our action will further propel our positive performance in the future, setting UniCredit to part as an attractive investment opportunity. We have delivered consistently outstanding results across all KPIs: growth, profitability, efficiency and distributions outpacing our peers. These achievements are down to clarity of direction, disciplined execution and the proactive steps we take to prepare for the future. UniCredit has transformed into a blue-chip bank with value still to unlock, lots of it. One defined by both resiliency and profitable growth. Resiliency through the cycle, leveraging our lines of defense and maintaining a quality-driven approach. Profitable growth through quality earnings and excellence in operational and capital efficiency all propelling our best-in-class distributions. Our past is marked by transformation. Our present by superior sustainable performance. Our future by our continuing to unlock significant potential. This performance is down to our mindset. It is the essence of how we engage with our clients and how we do business. This is the 14th consecutive quarter of quality growth, driven by our focus on profitable NII, increased fees and improved operational and capital efficiency, all leading to superior return on tangible equity and organic capital generation to support best-in-class distribution. Given the backdrop of rates and pass-through normalization, the profitable growth in gross NII of 5% in the half and 2% in the quarter is impressive. Overall, cost of risk remained well below our target at 5 basis points for the half and 1 basis points for the quarter, thanks to continued significant write-backs again, underscoring the conservativeness of our provisioning policy. As such, net NII dynamics mirrored those of gross NII. Our fee income grew 6.6% in the half and an impressive 10% in the quarter, thanks to our investments in people, fees in people and with fee-to-revenues reaching 33% and 34%, respectively. Our focus on operational efficiency, while investing, and capital efficiency, while targeting profitable growth, continue to set the standard for the industry. Absolute costs declined by 1.2% over the 6 months and 1.7% accelerating in the quarter. With our cost-to-income ratio further improving to 36.3%, 2.9 percentage points better than a year ago. Our net revenue to RWAs reached 9.1% in the quarter, up 1 percentage point from a year ago. RWAs were further reduced to \u20ac277 billion. It is the combined performance across all these levers but allowed us to reach a record return on tangible equity of 13% CET1 of circa 23.5%, 20% reported for both the half and the quarter, a record organic capital generation of \u20ac6.7 billion or 234 basis points for the half, supporting accrued distribution of \u20ac5.25 billion or 100% of net profit, while increasing our CET1 ratio to 16.2. A net profit growth of 20% for the half and 16% for the quarter. In the half, our EPS increased by 36%, our accrued EPS by 53% and our tangible book per share by 20%. These results are built on strong foundation across leading capital levels, sound asset quality and strong liquidity ratio. Let's now look at the P&L in further detail. Let's start with net revenues. Net revenues increased 7% to \u20ac12.6 billion in the half and 6% to \u20ac6.3 billion in the quarter. This is a result of a resilient, best-in-class NII, well above the cost of equity, a top-tier fee to revenue ratio with strong upside potential, a structurally lower and less volatile loan loss provision and continued solid trading. NII, net of provision play the critical role in our P&L., and we have focused on keeping it well above our cost of equity and resilient. We now have a RoAC above 20% in the quarter in NII. While this number will normalize on the back of lower rates and higher cost of risk, we have laid the foundation for value-accretive growth thereafter, always exceeding our cost of equity. Gross NII and margins are slightly down quarter-on-quarter as rates have started reducing. Pass-through has continued to increase, loan volumes have now recovered, and we focus on profitability. Strong management of the pass-through with an increase of only 1.4 percentage points to 31.5%, driven mainly by Germany with a skew to corporates and Central Europe, driven by Austria. Italy pass-through increased by less than 1 percentage point. Deposit volume stabilized Q-on-Q. We have continued to improve our lending mix as we move towards higher profitability and crossover segments. Those that bring us both corporate and retail clients with significantly diversified needs. Asset quality. Our NPE ratio has improved quarter-on-quarter, and we remain well covered. Our overlays to protect the future remain outsized and higher than the industry. The decline from 1.8% to 1.7% is a rounding equal to \u20ac25 million. Our overall cost of risk remains low, reflecting where we are in the cycle and benefiting from substantial write-backs. We witnessed continued significant write-backs across our entire franchise. Germany cost of risk run rate increased year-over-year as it may be earlier in the cost of recycle. Italy is broadly stable versus a year ago, while Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia saw significant net reversal in the half. Conservative past provisioning, leading to very significant write-backs enabled Russia to absorb half of the impact of a single name legal provision in risk and charges. As such, it may be interesting for you to consider our cost of risk together with single NIM risk and charges, which would raise the 1 basis point for the quarter to circa 19 basis points. Cost of risk, excluding Russia, was 12 basis points. For the half, broadly in line year-over-year and 11 basis points for the quarter, up 5 basis points year-over-year. We reaffirm our guidance of a cost of risk below or well below 20 basis points for the year, as we still plan for the start of the normalization of the cost of risk cycle and potential further precautionary provision in the second half. This is just a precaution at this point. Fees. Fees increased 7% in the half and 10% in the quarter as a result of our investments in product factories and renewed client appetite. These were propelled by clients rebalancing their portfolio ahead of the expected rate normalization and benefited from the renegotiation of some contracts in asset management and in payments. While we remain confident in our fee growth prospects and this strong cash should not be annualized. We have taken a measured and disciplined approach to further streamline our organization through the redesign and automation of processes and reducing bureaucracy. Our \u20ac1.1 billion of integration costs charged last year is allowing us to maintain our efficiency leadership while investing. Costs declined 1.2% in the half and 1.7%, therefore, accelerating in the quarter, with cost to income further improving to 36.3%. Our continued focus on operational efficiency has allowed us to invest in people, hiring, training, attractively rewarding and retaining our talent. And in our business, enhancing our product factories and digital capabilities. We intend to continue this investment whilst keeping the like-for-like cost base broadly flat going forward. Our best-in-class organic capital generation of \u20ac6.7 billion in the half and \u20ac3.3 billion in the quarter has allowed us to accrue 100% of net profit for distribution while increasing CET1 to 16.2% versus 15.7% like-for-like 1 year ago. Our disciplined focus on quality net revenue growth ensuring a net NII RoAC above cost of equity and an increasing ratio of fee to revenues, complemented by an obsessive focus on operational and capital efficiency of a key to maximizing profitability and organic capital generation while growing, maintaining best-in-class ordinary distribution without denting capital. This is a competitive advantage that will guide us going forward as we strive to support excellent ordinary distribution without denting CET1. Excess capital deployment will be additive to that. As we look at our regions and product factories, I would remind you of the differentiated strengths and value add that each of these bring to the overall group. UniCredit is much more than the sum of its part. Italy. Our Italian business had another excellent quarter, demonstrating its ability to deliver sustained quality profitable growth and outstanding returns well above peers. Net revenue rose 5.5% to \u20ac5.6 billion in the half and 3.7% in the quarter. NII was up 8% in the half and 3.3% in the quarter, thanks to strict management of the pass-through and continued rebalancing in our lending mix. Cost of risk remained mild at 28 basis points for the half and 23 basis points for the quarter, also benefiting from continued write-backs. Fees were up 7% in the half and 10% in the quarter, with all of our factories contributing but with particular strength in investments, in protection, in payments and in corporate finance. Italy is growing its assets under management and gaining market share in bank insurance and to a lesser extent in certificates as our advisory activity supports customer deploy additional investment in the right products. Hence, we have a greater impact from volume than from margin given certificate higher margins and upfronts. But we believe that this is the right strategy at this moment and will pay dividends in the future. Cost rose 0.6% in the half and 0.3% in the quarter, a structural savings from continued simplification and streamlining offset most of the inflation and investment in the business growth, including 550 new hires in the network and 350,000 hours of training to our people. RWAs were reduced by \u20ac12 billion or 10% half-on-half. Italy further strengthen its operating and capital efficiency with its best-ever 33.9% cost-income ratio and 10.6% net revenue to RWA. Profit before tax rose 16% to \u20ac3.4 billion in the half and 14% to \u20ac1.8 billion in the quarter. RoAC reached 32% in the half and 33% in the quarter. Italy generated \u20ac3 billion of organic capital in the half. Germany. Germany's profitability is the best in a decade, supported by excellent operational efficiency. Net revenue fell 3.6% to \u20ac2.7 billion in the half and 2.6% in the quarter. Germany quarterly NII would have been flat, adjusting for the impact of higher funding costs of our group trading portfolio, which was driven by higher volume. Overall, NII was down 10% in the half and 11% in the quarter. Being predominantly a corporate bank with a pass-through level on deposit near to 50%, Germany future sensitivity to rate normalization is fairly low. Cost of risk remained more elevated than the trend line at circa 20 basis points as our franchise is more sensitive to single name files and the country may or may not be earlier in the credit cycle. Fees were down 1% in the half, but up 3% in the quarter as performance accelerated across all categories, especially in investment, plus 18%, payment, plus 5%, nearly offsetting the lower client hedging fees compared to previous year's extremely high client demand. Germany had the most scope in rationalizing its corporate center and continues to do so. Costs were reduced 7 percentage points in the half and 6% in the quarter while continuing to fund investments. RWAs were reduced by \u20ac7 billion in Germany or 9% half-over-half. Germany continued to improve its operating and capital efficiency with a 39.2% cost-income ratio and 8% net revenue to RWA setting records. Pretax rose 18% to \u20ac1.6 billion in the half and 12% to \u20ac740 million in the quarter. RoAC remained at or above 20% for both the half and the quarter. Germany delivered \u20ac1.4 billion of organic capital generation in the half. Central Europe. Central Europe's profitability continues to be driven by strong revenue and disciplined cost control. Net revenue rose 5.5% to \u20ac2.2 billion in the half, but were down 0.8% in the quarter. NII was up 5.9% in the half and 1.4% in the quarter despite a downward trend but is expected to accelerated due to lower rates and higher pass-through. Cost of risk had net reversal of 5 basis points in the half and loan losses of 9 basis points in the quarter. Fees were up 11.5% in the half and 13% in the quarter, thanks to strong investment in Austria and a large advisory mandate in the Czech Republic. Business initiative across all segments should support this trend. Going forward, revenues will be more visibly impacted by the downward trend of interest rates, partially offset by strong contribution from fees performance. Costs grew by only 1.8% in the half due to wage drift, partially compensated by efficiency activities, enabling us to also continue investment in digitalization. RWAs were reduced to \u20ac1.2 billion -- by \u20ac1.2 billion or 2% in the half. The disciplined focus on operating and capital efficiency continued across all countries reflected in a 36.5% cost-to-income ratio and 7.4% net revenue on RWA ratio. Pretax rose 17% to \u20ac1.3 billion and 1% at \u20ac700 million in the quarter. RoAC was 24.3% in the half and accelerated to 26.2% in the quarter, and the region delivered \u20ac1.3 billion of capital organically in the half. Eastern Europe, outstanding profitability continued at pace this quarter, driven by excellent revenues and strong operational efficiency. Net revenues rose 21% to \u20ac1.5 billion in the half, increasing 26% in the quarter. NII was up 17% in the half and 12% in the quarter. Thanks to strong business growth across the region, a favorable rate environment and good pass-through control. Cost of risk, a net reversal of 59 basis points in the half due to continued write-back and a profitable NPE disposal and underscoring once more the conservativeness of our provisioning. Cost of fees were up 13% in the half, 14% in the quarter, driven by all categories. Going forward, revenue is expected to remain broadly stable despite a downward trend in interest rates, thanks to strong commercial activity, focused on profitable and capital-efficient business. Costs grew 3.4% in the half, offsetting most of the region, high inflation, whilst we continue to invest in our people and in digitalization. Our focus on operating and capital efficiency was reflected in a 30.3% cost-to-income ratio and 10.2% net revenue on RWA ratio in the half. Pretax grew 32% to \u20ac1 billion in the half and 35% to more than \u20ac550 million in the quarter. RoAC exceeded 40% in both half and quarter with a region delivering \u20ac600 million of capital organically in the half. Client Solutions. Turning to our product factory. Strong performance across the board. Client Solutions revenue grew by 7% in the half to \u20ac5.8 billion, 2/3 of which is fees. Corporate Solutions revenues rose by 4% to \u20ac2.7 billion in the half, driven by advisory and financing up 9%. Payment Solutions rose by 6% to \u20ac1.3 billion, driven by payments, up 14%. Individual Solutions rose by 13% to \u20ac1.7 billion, driven by investment up 17%. Onemarkets grew to \u20ac8 billion in AUM, confirming our business proposition. Our transformation from laggard to leader is due to the consistent delivery across all metrics, regions and products. We have moved from a bank languishing in the bottom quadrant to one in the top quartile, defined by quality revenues, profitability, organic capital generation and distribution metrics, consistently outperforming our core peers for 9 consecutive quarters. Our disciplined focus on quality profitable growth over volumes naturally constrained our net revenue and net profit growth versus peer with a greater volume focus. Regardless, we move close to leadership position in both cases. Our strategy aims to excel in net revenue over RWA, organic capital generation, which ultimately supports distribution, cost-to-income ratio and return on tangible equity. Here, we move to and retain clear leadership outperforming all peers. We have significant further room to add value, and you will see that going forward. Moving to tomorrow. Today, we're a completely different bank, one that has demonstrated its ability to consistently deliver. Our remarkable performance has propelled our total shareholder return and market cap rose to the top of the sector, while we continue to invest in the future, and we have just begun. We will build on this momentum, continue to deliver accretive profitable high-quality growth over volume, underpinning best-in-class distribution, outperformed our benchmarks and ultimately secure a valuation that truly reflects our worth. We're not just prepared for the future, we're shaping it. We have the resilience, the flexibility and the ability to adjust to extenuating circumstances without impacting our overall performance, and this quarter is not an exception. Our people and our winning culture will unlock even greater value in the future. Our commitment to our stakeholder remains unchanged. We aim to become the bank for Europe's future, empowering communities to progress and setting a new benchmark for banking. This is the guiding star that unites and inspire us all at UniCredit. We shall continue to strive for the best outcome for our 3 stakeholders. By putting our clients and community at the very heart of everything we do, we are transforming our organization from the ground up. Our client success is our success and their satisfaction is our ultimate reward. Our people represent the true value of UniCredit. We empower them, invest in them and foster an environment where they can thrive. Their dedication and passion are the driving forces behind our achievements, and we are committed to supporting them. Our investors provide us with the financial resources to achieve our objectives, and we are committed to protect their interest and deliver the highest sustainable returns and distribution to reward them. Our profitability and distribution yields are the best in the peer group, achieved without compromising our capital, asset quality and liquidity strengths. The vision and this commitment will not change. Our strategy also remains unchanged, specifically designed to play to our strengths and address our weaknesses. It is composed of a set of levers which we can flex depending on the needs of the business, the growth opportunities and the external environment. It is the combination of those levers that allows us to evolve over time, while being consistent to our vision and objectives. We have put our clients back at the center that has shaped a new business model. We have progressively redesigned our organization turning in on inside, we have redesigned our processes, way of working, aiming to achieve excellence in efficiency, leveraging our scale in technology, in data, in operation, in procurement, in training and in product offering to deliver with speed and quality. We are uniting and empowering our people around one vision, one winning culture, one set of principle and value, and we are supporting them with the right organization and tools. We're developing best-in-class product factories, alone or with strategic partners, to deliver the best financial services, product to 15 million clients across Europe by increasingly integrated distribution channel freely selected by our clients. We're investing in best-in-class technology and data, evolving our operation to continue to secure efficiency while enhancing our clients and on people experiences. Our strategy is underpinned by clear financial targets, delivered through an optimal balance of our 3 financial levers. Given the changed environment and our ongoing transformation, we have shifted or are shifting our focus to quality top line growth while maintaining leadership in asset quality, in capital and in operational expense. To grow our top line in a quality way, once freight and cost of risk normalize, we will continue to tilt the mix of our lending towards high net NII RoAC products and segments while fulfilling our clients' broader needs. This will also drive fee growth, supported by investment in our people, in our factories, in our distribution channels and in our technology. Doing so, we will maximize our capital efficiency, enhance capital generation and profitability, powered by our improvement in operational excellence. Our dedicated approach to quality over volume and our proactive buildup of lines of defense result in a uniquely resilient bottom line and confidence in our long-term outlook. Given headwinds, this result could have been expected to go in the opposite direction, they didn't. Our cost of risk is defined by quality focus and a conservative approach, and we have still \u20ac1.7 billion overlays to further support our cost of risk. In cost, we continue our obsession with efficiency, holding \u20ac1.5 billion of buffers already sustained from nonoperating items last year. In capital, we focus on optimal capital allocation and a superior profitability portfolio mix with \u20ac6.5 billion of excess capital, protecting total distribution and/or allowing for strategic flexibility to further propel net profit through inorganic and now with Vodeno-Aion organic external growth. Our task now is to maintain our leadership across all these levers. But our new focus is to be in a unique position on NII as our approach gives us a very high quality and profitable top line whose growth is now the central focus of our strategy. Without changing strategy, we now shift our focus from the operating machine to the commercial machine. Our commitment to quality over volume and our diversified footprint have resulted in NII growth that aligns with our European peers. But with net NII RoAC, having grown by 3x and its resilience enhanced by the shift in our lending mix. Our future in fees looks bright, given the momentum and the further impact of our past and planned investment and internalization. The combination of the higher resilience of NII and above-market growth of fees gives us confidence on the future top line trajectory. The strong foundation, proven track record and diversified levers to generate fee-based growth above market rates uniquely position us for the future. Vodeno-Aion. Through our investment in Vodeno-Aion, UniCredit acquires. Firstly, Vodeno's next-generation cloud-based core banking technology, fully competitive with best-in-class providers such as [food machine] [indiscernible] Scalable and flexible offering a comprehensive suite of digital banking products across multiple channels. We are welcoming 200 technology engineers, developers and data scientists as well as a management team with a strong track record in banking and technology implementation. Through Aion, we acquired a small bank incorporated in Belgium, whose legacy technology and clients have already been successfully migrated to Vodeno, and that already operate through a branch structure in Poland, Germany and Sweden. It is the combination of Vodeno and Aion that provides them with a competitive advantage vis-a-vis pure technology providers and fintechs. This investment propels UniCredit into a new realm of technology development and digital banking, ensuring a strong differentiation from pure technology providers, neobanks and incumbents undergoing digital transformation. Going forward, UniCredit will be able to leverage Vodeno's technology and talent to further develop this now proprietary technology and use it as a sandbox for a number of technology innovations. We can use Aion to profitably and quickly enter targeted client segments for entire markets across Europe, providing additional opportunities to deploy our excess capital. This is our third route. Vodeno and Aion will continue to target embedded finance services to marketplaces, e-commerce retailers, travel, health care and education platform and banking as a service to -- for selected fintechs. We aim to start with a project on Poland, considering the significant level of synergies with our other European markets and the credibility and experience of the Vodeno and Aion management team in the area. We will come back to you with further detail once the project is fully fledged. We're investing \u20ac370 million in cash for 100% of Vodeno, Aion with an expected impact on our CET1 of circa 15 basis points. The P&L impact of the consolidation will be dependent on the level and speed of additional investment that we made to develop this technology and these franchises, and we will communicate it to you in due course. We expect to close by year-end, subject to regulatory approval. I may add, we have no intention of integrating Vodeno-Aion. They will be like our 14th bank providing us with selective technology and organic growth opportunity through start-ups in various markets and marketplaces. I will now provide you with an update on Russia. Our strategy has been clear since day 1, working towards an ordinarily solvent, wind down as quickly as possible, always without both the letter and the spirit of a complex legal, regulatory and sanction limitation. At each and every step we have held true to our values, determined to do right by our principles and reputation, even if capitulating to pressure would have been the easier pass at the time. We remained determined not to take action, but by breaching local laws and regulation provide Russia with a justified motive to intervene and take control of our local asset and the value that comes with it. Facts speak to themselves. We have significantly reduced our activity since the first quarter of '22, particularly those not related to Western companies. Cross-border exposure is down 93% from \u20ac4.5 billion to \u20ac300 million, while minimizing our loss to 11% of principal. Local loans are down 68% from \u20ac7.3 billion to \u20ac2.3 billion. Local deposits are down 69% from \u20ac8.3 billion to \u20ac2.6 billion. And cross-border payments are down 56% from \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac11.2 billion. I remind that as all of our economies continue to purchase selective materials from Russia, those materials go through the payment system of 3 banks. In doing so, we have also absorbed the drag on our growth and profitability. And more importantly, we reduced the capital impact of a full write-down of Russia from circa 130 basis points on a 14% CET1 to circa 50 basis points on a 16.2% CET1, transforming it from very significant to non-substantial. Looking ahead, our ultimate goal is clear and unwavering, and we believe fully consistent with the expectation of our regulator. We will continue to drive down our exposure to Russia, and are continuing as we speak. Our existing plan foresees the following targets for 2025. Cross-border exposure, practically 0, with 100% reduction. Local loans below \u20ac1 billion with an 85% reduction. Local deposits, below \u20ac2 billion with in excess of 75% reduction. Cross-border payment to \u20ac8.5 billion, with more than a 66% reduction. Recently, we were advised by the straightforward implementation of recent instruction by the ECB may be inconsistent with our legal framework in certain area or conflicting with other duties. Given the seriousness of the potential consequences involved, we have sought legal clarity from the European Court of Justice to protect UniCredit from unnecessary risks, including potentially providing Russia with a justified motive to intervene and take control of our local asset and the value that comes with them. We welcome the ECB's recent openness to further clarify the request, have of any ruling and remain open to withdraw our request to the ECJ, should their clarification provide us with a necessary legal comfort. Should it be necessary for the proceeding to continue, we consider an institutional win any ECJ ruling regardless of the outcome as we would have confirmed the legality of the past, we have been ordered and the rule of law in all of our actions. Let's move to guidance. The strong start to the year allows us to increase our net revenue guidance to over \u20ac23 billion from circa \u20ac22.5 billion. This is thanks to the strong performance across all revenue lines and higher expectation for the full year skewed more towards net interest income. Our operational and capital efficiency results are also ahead of plan as we have front-loaded a number of initiatives. We have chosen not to upgrade our net profit and return on tangible guidance at this time as we retain flexibility to further support our future performance as we have done every year. However, I want to be clear, putting aside that flexibility, our underlying performance is sent to substantially exceed or in other words, blow out our net profit and return on tangible guidance. This is the same conservative approach we have taken so far. Our 2025 and 2026 ambition remains steady and confirm. We are well positioned to continue our trajectory of sustainable profitable growth and outsized distribution. And if this -- and it is the sustainability of high growth and high profitability and high distribution that provides the value of UniCredit. In conclusion, we have again demonstrated the effectiveness of our UniCredit unlock strategy. Our metrics of growth, efficiency, capital generation, profitability and distribution set a benchmark for our industry. We have moved from a restructuring story to a blue-chip bank with superior growth and distribution prospects. We face the future with the same strategy shifting our emphasis from our efficiency KPIs, which we shall defend, to our top line quality growth KPIs. We have leading profitability and distribution, strong line of defense and more than \u20ac6.5 billion of excess capital that protect or further propels our profitability and distribution depending on the opportunity. We have plenty of runway and are excited to show what we can do when rates and cost of risk normalize. The team has demonstrated again and again their ability to come through, and they continue to surprise even me. I would not want to bet against them. Both our price to earnings and price to distribution multiples remains at a substantial discount to not only top peers but also to the broader sector, particularly when considering our fundamentals and the comfort provided by our line of defense and excess capital. We offer a unique investment opportunity at an attractive entry point. Thank you all, and we shall open for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Andrea Filtri of Mediobanca.\nAndrea Filtri: I wonder if you could please reiterate your NII income guidance without Russia. And as just said, you have built a very large implied net profit cushion. Should we then read the implied cushion in your net profit guidance as the eventual actions that could come or Russia later on and that are unforeseeable at the moment or it is more to smoothen year-on-year profitability '24 and '25 and '26.\nAndrea Orcel: I will start, and Stefano will finish. So our NII guidance has been increased to in excess of \u20ac23 billion. Our fee guidance for the moment is remaining the same. We have been proven wrong in as much as this was the same thing we told you in the first quarter when we thought that the jump in fees could not be replicated in the second quarter. It was actually not only replicated, it jumped further up with an acceleration. We are cautious. This is part of the culture of this organization in replicating that in the second year because a number of these movements are due to clients going ahead of the expected normalization of rates and rebalancing their portfolio. So when this rebalancing will finish and what comes next is now speculation. So we think it is the prudent things to do to not double the first half into a second one in terms of fee. Therefore, we keep it unchanged with, I would say, an upside risk. Which goes back to the cushion, more than the cushion, I would refer you to what we did in '21, to what we did in '22, to what we did in '23. We have a tendency to exceed our guidance, and we have a tendency to also put down the foundation to continue to grow from what becomes then a pretty high bar. And at this point in time, the right thing to do is to tell you, we are going to be above \u20ac8.5 billion. We are going to beat the 16.5% return on tangible equity. We are going to beat on cost, but how much is premature, because we would like to use some of that, as you called it, cushion, to potentially further propel the profitability that is already quite ambitious for '25, '26 and beyond. So it's not a -- there is a cushion. It's very difficult for us to tell you what is the number. What the numbers that we can give you, but maybe not number, but direction we can give you, is that if I take away what you call a cushion, the underlying is obviously marching well above \u20ac8.5 billion and well above 16.5%. With respect to Russia, we continue to compress the franchise there. And we have had a number of legal cases like everybody else. This one is, just to be clear, has -- is the last one in terms of guarantees that we provided over the last significant ones. And again, we are not sure of the outcome. The outcome could be, a, that we get hit; b, but legally, we have claim on the clients we guaranteed it is premature to tell you that. So -- but for the time being, Russia has demonstrated that it had significant buffers without touching our overall overlays to absorb the shock. So Russia is not driving what we're saying about net profit and return on tangible equity.\nStefano Porro: Andrea just add a few points to what Andrea just said, in relation to the guidance for net revenues and fees is including Russia. Having said that, the contribution of fees is not material. If you go beyond 2024, we are dealing with center-like below \u20ac100 million, while as we have stated more than once, especially starting from second part of this year, but also '25, the reduction of net interest income in Russia will be a few hundreds million.\nOperator: The next question is from Ignacio Cerezo of UBS.\nIgnacio Cerezo : I've got two on NII. One is, if you can share your views a little bit actually. I know it is a combination of several geographies. But if you can give us a little bit of color in terms of the pass-through levels you're expecting on lending and deposits as rates starts compounding, and any geographical color basically would be helpful. And specifically on this, I mean, we're seeing deposit cost in Germany, and I'm guessing Austria still going up, obviously, I mean, that might become a tailwind when rates start going down. So the question is how quickly do you think you can reprice your deposits in those 2 countries to start protecting the net interest income as rate start going down.\nStefano Porro: So in relation to deposit pass-through, the group is at 31.5%. The split by countries is the following. We are at 15.5% in Italy. We are at 28% in Eastern Europe, and we are above 46% in both Germany and Central Europe, including Austria. In terms of trend we saw in the quarter an increase of around 1% in Italy and Eastern Europe and around 3% up in Germany and Central Europe. Now if you look all in all, the deposit cost, the deposit costs didn't move up so much. So we are dealing with a few basis points when you're looking at the absolute amount. The composition is there is very different because in Italy, we have a 95% side deposit, while take, for example, Germany or Central Europe, we have 55% and 60%, respectively. That means that the reduction of the Euribor and the connected repricing will happen especially in Germany and in Austria. How long does it take? I mean, it will be already in the second part of the year, consider that the average maturity of term deposit is a range between 3 months and 5 months. So taking that in consideration with a slight delay, we will have repricing down. So what we can expect in overall cost of deposit, absolute rate at year end, below the level of second quarter.\nAndrea Orcel: I think I would like to add that if you look at our franchises, Italy and Eastern Europe are balanced between retail and corporate. Germany and Central Europe are predominantly corporate. So the sensitivity is very different in the 3 blocks, if you call them this way. So Germany and Central Europe benefit much less and are much more sensitive going up because they reprice quickly. Hence, the pass-through that is so high. But when it goes down, they also can reprice faster because there is more scope to reprice on the deposit side. So I think the group altogether is quite balanced. But if you took those two, they behave differently from the other two.\nOperator: The next question is from Ignacio Ulargui of the Paribas Exane.\nIgnacio Ulargui: I just have one question, which is on the translation of organic capital generation into distributions. And then how should we expect the improved guidance of organic capital generation into distributions into 2024?\nAndrea Orcel: For the time being, if you remember, we said that our distribution policy is set on 2 things, more than 90% -- for normal distribution -- sorry, for ordinary distribution, let me rephrase. For ordinary distribution, at least 90% of net profit, and secondly, not exceeding our organic capital generation because we think that, that is the prudent things to do for ordinary. What we do with strongly, i.e., the excess capital is on top and separate. And to date, we have never used our excess capital to pay our distribution. We have actually accumulated more of it. So I would say that the distribution for the end of the year will be consistent with those metrics and therefore, depending on where we land in terms of net profit and organic capital generation, we will act accordingly on the ordinary side. On the nonordinary side, i.e., the excess capital that is a judgment call, and we have told you that between '24 and '27, we will either deploy it or return it in full. We also told you that this year, we're targeting \u20ac8.6 billion of distributions based on the metrics that I just gave you of net profit and organic capital generation and that we feel that we can repeat that or exceed it in '25, in '26 -- and in '26. And we stay firm on those numbers. As of today, we have accrued 100% of our net profit, so not 90%, 100%, \u20ac5.25 billion, but 60% of the \u20ac8.6 billion we wanted to distribute. And obviously, we've done that with an organic capital generation that exceeds that. That's why our CET1 has moved up year-on-year or has moved up since the end of the year where we were at 15.9%. So that is consistent. We're not moving.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Hallam of Goldman Sachs.\nChris Hallam: So 2 for me. First, on NII, you talked about using that technology platform, I suppose, is an avenue to enter new market segments. So there's obviously a revenue opportunity there. But does getting that capability inside the group also make you think at all about touching your own core. I know you've been a bit reluctant in the past to take that step. But are there things you'd be able to do to the UniCredit systems now inside the group that perhaps you were a bit -- were a bit too difficult to do previously? And then second, clearly, is running well ahead of where you target it in the medium term? And if we take the commentary around flattish costs over the next couple of years as well as what we can see rates and fees, does it feel like that level of profitability needed to reset significantly lower. So if we think about the financial guardrails of any potential acquisition, could that greater than 15% RoTE hurdle rate be adjusted higher if your view on the medium-term returns for UniCredit turns more constructive, i.e., does better organic performance today raise the bar on what you look for in potential deals tomorrow?\nAndrea Orcel: So Chris, let me take in reverse order. I think I'm already criticized enough to be to discipline on M&A. If you want to increase my hurdle rate, you will have to deal with a lot of people. But that said, we think we can beat now seriously the 15% over a cycle. And it is clear that when we look and when we are accountable to our shareholders, we look at the returns -- the risk returns of buying back our own stock versus what we get through acquisitions, and we take a balanced view. It is also true that if you continue to buy your own stock and never grow, we are growing at the moment, but never grow through in organic growth, at one point, you stop growing. And therefore, we're not there. We are actually quite far from there, but we always balance these things. So I would say that we remain constructive on M&A, but we remain very disciplined on M&A. And more than the hurdle rates, I would say that with normalization of rates and provisions, we believe that not everyone has done the hard work in terms of taking integration costs on to improve their efficiency in terms of building overlays, in terms of investing in technology, in terms of a lot of things. And therefore, if profit -- if that comes through in the numbers, and valuation align or diverge in a positive fashion, then M&A will be more possible. With respect to more generally Vodeno and Aion, first thing, that I would say is the biggest mistake we could make is to integrate Vodeno and Aion. There would be nothing left. We are a phenomenal bank, but we are also a large monster. They are an agile speed boat and they should remain this way, and we will respect that. It will, however, give us a proprietary technology that has successfully transitioned a legacy bank, small one, to a new set of technology and to a new core. At this point in time, we do not expect to touch our core, too difficult, too complex and too many banks involved. We are only continuing internally to pursue our strategy and our plan to evolve all the aspects of our technology and our data and make it a competitive advantage, and we are confident we can do that. We expect to Vodeno, Aion, it is what I have said it is. We now have a proprietary cutting-edge technology, cloud-based for core banking. We also have a very flexible product suite with the ability to add new products on that core banking technology very cheaply. And together with Aion, that allows us to credibly and I underline profitably, enter -- so it's not a revenue gain, it's a profitability gain, to enter new market and be credible when we say this is a return on investment of more than 15% over the next 3 to 5 years. Something we would not have been able to do with the main bank. So as I said, consider it as 14 banks with a lot of greenfield startup opportunity but can further drive our growth. And combined with 200 engineers who have been extremely successful in building a cutting-edge technology that will allow us to not only trade that technology, not only to sell it as a service to fintech and other smaller banks, but also most importantly, challenge and help us drive improvement into our own bank, but not integrated in it, separate from it.\nOperator: The next question is from Britta Schmidt of Autonomous Research.\nBritta Schmidt: The first one is coming back to your net revenue guide which has been upgraded by \u20ac1 billion while keeping the cost of risk flat and more so as point to not really changing the fee guidance. If we were to take that further less, that means that there's a \u20ac1 billion at net interest income outlook and the overall that the second half could be closer, if not match the first half? And the second question is on the cost guidance. Cost guidance flat [ex] perimeter changes. Could you give us an update how you expect the closing of the Romania acquisition and the insurance bank.\nAndrea Orcel: So -- and let me start with the second one, and then I'll pass it to Stefano. So on the cost guidance, what we have said at the end of last year is that, and I underline that, in spite of inflation, wage drift and a determination to keep our level of investments, we could commit to keep our cost flat on the perimeter that existed obviously from 2023 to 2026. Now broadly flat, flat. So that guidance has not changed. As you will notice, we're well ahead of our guidance as of today because we're not broadly flat. We're down 1.2% and accelerated to down 1.7% in the quarter. So our cost control at the moment is excellent, and I'm very satisfied with it. And we haven't touched our investments. So where we're going to go at the moment, we're still guiding for broadly flat to 2026 on the numbers we had in 2023. Whether we do better than that, it's too early to say. We are in the second quarter of the year. It is premature. And the only reason why we say experiment changes, it's obvious. Vodeno and Aion comes in, if we have significant growth opportunities, and we decided to take them we are going to adjust everything, but it will be with a return on investment overall in excess of 15%. We cannot guess all of that at the moment. With respect to the net revenue guidance, I would say the following. We are prudent. I would say that our net revenue guidance has upside risk. It has upside risk on net NII because while we haven't changed the guidance of cost of risk from below 20 basis points, below 20 basis points does not mean 19. Below 20 basis points mean below 20 basis points. 0 is below 20 basis points, 10 is below 20 basis points, 15 is below 20 basis points. We haven't updated it because, again, it is premature to give you a number that we can stand solid on it and beat, and therefore, we will probably update that by the third quarter. If you take our fees, as we said, we are well ahead of our trend line. But there are too many positive wins that are propelling that, rebalancing our portfolios, upfront fees, renegotiation of certain contracts, for us to tell you what is the underlying sustainable trend line for that. But if you take those numbers, they are significantly ahead. And thirdly, if you take NII even without the cost of risk, the reduction is significantly less than what we expected. So what we are doing at the moment is to tell you, look, it would be superficial for us to give you a new number without having more time to observe the trends and more solidity to back that number. But if you ask me what is the direction of travel today, of course, we are well ahead of what our guidance is today.\nStefano Porro: Timing in relation to perimeter changes that can affect cost. Second half '24 is Alpha in Romania, and Vodeno, Aion, as we discussed before, while for insurance perimeter changes in Italy is first half 2025.\nOperator: The next question is from Delphine Lee of JPMorgan.\nDelphine Lee: So my first question is going back to the net interest income. I just wanted to see if you could give us some color around 2025. I mean your NII has increased only 65%, as you mentioned on the slide and deposit pass-through is higher in Germany, Austria, just trying to think about how resilient that can be going forward as a result? And how quickly -- I mean what assumption can we use for '25, '26 in deposit pass-through for Germany and Austria, given it's at 46% right now? My second question is on cost. Andrea, you mentioned in the past, more cost savings potential for the headquarters. I just wanted to check whether that -- this is already covered by the restructuring charges you booked in 2023 or so far? Or should we expect more restructuring charges to be booked by the end of this year?\nAndrea Orcel: So I'll start and Stefano will give more precision. Let me start with cost. So what we're doing in cost is fully consistent to what we have been doing for the last 3 years. The fact that it came in the press was to clarify a number of perceptions, but we are executing as we had planned to execute year after year. So when we talk about, we will keep our cost broadly flat to the exit of 2023, notwithstanding which drift inflation and investment. I assure you we need to pedal very hard to do that. I don't think that there are many banks that are going to be capable to do that, especially coming from 2 years of uninterrupted decrease of cost quarter after quarter, while most of the industry has gone up. So we can do it, but it is hard. And at the moment, I would just say that we're just executing on what we're doing. If we find further opportunity to go beyond what we have promised, i.e., broadly flat to the end of '22, 2023, if we find them, and it's becoming harder because it requires much more granular organization redesign, process redesign, automation, improvement of a number of things in technology. But if we find them, and there is a justified return, but like everything else needs to exceed 15% by us taking integration cost, like we have taken them in '23 and '22 and '21 in the fourth quarter, we will consider to do that. And I think it's the right thing to do to then further propel '25 and '26 and '27. With respect to more generally on NII and everything else, I would just open with 2 things. The first thing, while we start from Italy, where a pan-European bank, why is that important? Because our NII sensitivity is way more aligned with European banks than it is with Italians. We -- Italians have been over 100% sensitivity. We've been around 50%, like Europeans. But if you are less sensitive on the way up, you're also less sensitive on the way down. And that's why I think some of the numbers that you're seeing are more resilient than we all thought they would be. The second thing is countries like Germany or Central Europe, have benefited a lot less than 50% from the rising rates. But at the same time, they will reprice and they will suffer a lot less from the decline in rates. So what you see of UniCredit is a bring to bear of all of these things together. And it is a little bit too early to say how it's going, but for the time being, our NII is being more resilient. Now let's never forget two things that where we are in the trend of -- in the level of rates. And I don't know what you forecast. But if you're looking at an exit of 2.25, 2.5 and a pass-through that will normalize, the hurdle that we all need to fight against is quite high. I would finish with one last thing because we insist on it because we think it's very important, maybe not everybody finds it important. The profitability as NII as a line item, so of lending as a line item is often overlooked. And we looked at the overall profitability. But if a bank has 60%, 70%, 80%, 75% of NII, and is actually subsidizing the rest of the business by going below the cost of equity or by not maximizing the profitability of NII by going on volume. I could get you higher NII in terms of volume, you will see declining return on tangible, reclining organic capital generation, declining distribution over time. We're not doing that. But that also means that we have drawn less than others or than what we could have done and that puts us in a more resilient position than others. The final thing is we've discussed it many times, the lending mix, which is another thing you should all consider. We started with a lending mix that was secured from a risk standpoint, but with a return on that lending that was way subpar. We have moved that mix. What have we done? For example, in Italy, we have deemphasized mortgages. We have pushed on consumer. We've pushed on SMEs. Obviously, that means that your volumes are growing less because mortgages, large corporates are large volumes. SMEs, consumer are small volume. However, you're shifting your portfolio to something a lot more resilient and where margins are much higher. We've been doing that for 2 years, and we're doing it this year. And when we exit, we hope that the renewed growth now no longer net of what we're not doing on the large volumes item and the profitability will emerge in our P&L. So all of these pieces are getting organized to try and minimize the impact of our net revenues because we recognize that while we have the other lines positive, like cost, like cost of risk, et cetera, et cetera, we cannot compensate only with those lines, what will happen when rates normalize and cost of risk normalize, which is why we all are looking forward to the challenge and the competition of how we deal with that versus the sector.\nStefano Porro: So adding some data points, sensitivities. Solid sensitivities in relation to interest income are confirmed. So the interest rate-related one, plus minus 25 basis points at \u20ac140 million. And you can also expect such a sensitivity to be slightly lower during the course of '25 as highlighted by Andrea. The deposit pass-through sensitivity, 1 percentage point confirmed at \u20ac130 million. With regards to Germany and Austria, I mentioned before, let's say, the deposit pass-through either ratio between the client rate and the short-term interbank rate that is around 46 basis points. Let's translate that into basis point number. So in Germany, the cost of our deposit is slightly below 200 basis points. In Italy, it's close to 60 basis points. This makes the difference. So that's why the repricing possibility that we have in Germany and also Austria are higher. Now you need to look with a pinch of salt in relation to the deposit pass-through because when the rates will go down, technically speaking, the deposit pass-through will go up, right? And then after a while, we will reprice down. This will be especially important for Germany and Austria because of the term deposit component, it will be less likely by definition to something like that in Italy because, as commented, we are already close to 60 basis points. So there is not much room to repricing down. In relation to Germany and Austria, as I told you, we are expecting to have a level of cost for the deposit lower, in the case of Germany, lower than 190, the deposit pass-through expected for '25, it will be slightly higher because there will be a part of the deposit that we cannot reprice and as a cost of that, the deposit pass-through is slightly higher. But having said that, the overall interest expenses on deposits that we will have in Germany and Austria '25 will be definitely lower.\nOperator: The next question is from Azzurra Guelfi of Citi.\nAzzurra Guelfi: Looking to your point about that you when talking about the NII and the profitability of NII. Can you give us an idea of how much of your current book is still in -- if you want to be low average profitability? And what are the categories that you see that it could reverse earlier when the rates normalize? And the second one is on the asset quality. You have said that the guidance is below 20 basis points, that would be significantly below 20 basis points, if I understand well, between the lines. And when I look to the actual data, actually shows that the NPLs are decreasing quarter-on-quarter, in particularly on the unlikely to pay. And also, when I look at Stage 2 and Stage 1, there has been some migration and improvement of the quality. So the underlying data feeds to suggest that the situation is still quite benign. If you can give us some color on what are the trends there, that would be great.\nAndrea Orcel: So thank you, Azzurra. So as you have seen, our NII profitability all the way down, so also net of provision is about 20% at the moment or is in excess. We still have about 20% of our book that has still not migrated to above cost of equity. We started with the large majority of our book. We have about 20% of our book that has not migrated. So in the next, I would say, 18 months we will never get to 100%. It's just not feasible, but we will finish that migration, and we'll have a book that is a lot higher profitability, a lot more resilient, and we will not have the grind that we have experienced from obviously many times exiting lending position that were not meeting our hurdle. With rest to asset quality. I would just say that it's premature to say how much below 20 basis points we're going to land. You are correct. Our NPEs have improved, both gross and net our coverage has improved, and we are having a positive stage migration again and write-backs as we have kept being prudent in the way we were provisioning. So there is a point where even if you have provision for caution, if your clients repays you, you get back the provisions. So I think we are, at the moment, experiencing that positive trend. So the only thing on asset quality, in my opinion, is the issue that at some point, all of these write-backs will finish because we will continue to provision conservatively. But I think in the past, we were way more worried about the future, and we provisioned a lot, and this little by little are coming back, but we will be more orderly. At the same time, we have less necessity to be cautious because of the quality of our portfolio and because we still carry I think, well over \u20ac1.7 billion of overlays. That's what it is, therefore, to avoid us having bad surprises or to release it if bad surprises don't come. Maybe Stefano wants to add?\nStefano Porro: Yes, in relation to the trends of the movement of Stage 2 position, we had improvement fundamentally in all the countries. So in Italy, Germany, Central Europe and Eastern Europe in relation to the percentage, I would mention, Italy and Germany. So the Stage 2 percentage out of the total book now is 8% in Italy, slightly above 10%, is between 10% and 11% in Germany.\nOperator: The next question is from Pamela Zuluaga of Morgan Stanley.\nPamela Zuluaga: I have a few follow-ups actually. You have been, as you say, writing back some provisions mostly in Eastern Europe, but the overlay is still at a significant \u20ac1.7 billion. Can you remind us what is the deadline for the use of release of these overlays? And then when exactly do you expect to see that flat normalization in the cost of risk? The other follow-up is on your net profit comments. I know we've talked about this, but just trying to get a little bit more color. You say you don't want to continue raising the bar of the net profit to maintain some flexibility. Could this flexibility relate to any further restructuring charges from your plans to reorganize the corporate center or anything else?\nAndrea Orcel: So we -- so overlays in inverted commas, \"Don't have a hard deadline. What they have is a causality.\" You take an overlay over a specific potential risk. We took quite a few on COVID. We've then took quite a few on the geopolitical situation with secondary effect from the invasion of Ukraine, et cetera, et cetera. So they have a cause. So you say, fundamentally, my models are backward looking. They are great, but there are certain aspects of forward-looking but are not fully captured by our models, let's be cautionary -- let's use caution and create some provision in case the effect. Once that item does not occur or it's clear that it's not occurring, you need to release the overlays. Obviously, the item occurs, you release the overlays. So either you release the overlays because the item occur and you're covering it, or you release the overlay because the item does not occur, and then it propels your returns. What we have been doing over the last 3 years, not because necessarily proactively, but just because of the volatility and the uncertainty of the future is every time a causality of an overlay led to release, and in most cases, it was a release without the risk occurring. There were other reasons why we should create new overlays. And therefore, we have pushed in time, the overlay. So consider it this way, we had plenty of overlays for COVID. When the impact from COVID did not occur. Well, for example, Russian invaded Ukraine and we had other risk, and we move those -- that causality into a new causality, but now it's kind of stabilizing. So in the next, I would say -- I don't think, for the time being, but hopefully, I'm not proven wrong, but I don't think for the time being that the second half of this year will lead to a significant release of overlays. That means that we have \u20ac1.7 billion that should be released between '25 and '26 in my opinion. It's quite difficult to see with a stabilizing environment that we can carry them anywhere further. So either potential worries occur, and we will have the buffer, or the potential worries do not occur, and we will have a propelling effect by abating our cost of risk, and it will go into the bottom line. That's why we call it a line of defense that can protect or propel. With respect to transformation, as we said, we are a transformed bank. We've done a lot. I think we're about -- we're more than halfway through. There we continue to challenge everything that we do, how we do it, to see if we can do it more efficiently, more effectively better. We continue to challenge what we do in terms of investing in our product factories, in our frontline, in our distribution channel, in our branches, both physical and nonphysical. We're now going to get to challenge what we can do organically to grow with Aion and Vodeno. So as we go through that process and I think what is right, what is impressive is the culture of UniCredit that keeps on challenging what we do and seeing if we can do it better. We find new things that we said, why didn't I think about this earlier. We should change it, we should improve it. And when we found those new things, we obviously need to invest into making the improvement, either it's an investment in, I don't know, writing-off some old technology and implementing new one, or it is about prevention some people and hire some more young people, or it is about preempting the investment in launching a new digital bank or whatever it is. When we have those things, we do, do the broad category of integration cost. We usually culminate in that thinking at the end of the year just because we -- it's difficult to do it while we're flying. And therefore, if you go back and you look, we have done integration cost in '21, we have done integration cost in '22. We have done integration cost in '23. As we became better and better anticipating and investing to push the bank further. We are working hard on seeing whatever levers and whatever things we can find. And if we find them, we will take some integration cost. There is one commitment that does not move. We will make more than \u20ac8.5 billion net profit. And we will make at least a 16.5% return on tangible. And we will distribute at least \u20ac8.6 billion. So we will not put these things at risk. But the magnitude of the beat because beat there will be is determined by how much we are going to be able to support and continue growing in '25, '26 and '27. And part of that is taking certain charges or making some investment or doing things that are all included in the integration cost line.\nOperator: The next question is from Marco Nicolai of Jefferies.\nMarco Nicolai: Do you expect any impact from the ECB force to increase provisioning levels on the leveraged loan at UniCredit? So this is the first question. And the second one is you increased the organic capital generation guidance, you left them changed the net income guidance. My question is, shall we read into this more synergies in terms of risk-weighted assets reduction?\nAndrea Orcel: So I'll start with the second one. No. It is -- so the organic capital generation is not chemistry. The organic capital generation is where do you grow. How profitably do you grow? So for example, if tomorrow -- the more we increase the mix in our revenues to fees, the more organic capital generation increases because fees do not require capital. So it's net profit that goes directly to the bottom line. With fees doing that well, implicitly, our organic capital generation increases. Secondly -- the second point which I keep on hammering is the profitability of NII, not the volume of NII, the profitability of NII. If my profitability of NII increases while I am using capital, I am generating a lot more than my profitability of NII decreases. You're looking at the profitability of our NII is increasing. And therefore, the combination of an NII that maybe in volume, you see the same volume or decline in volume, and you say, well, it's the same. No, it's not the same because if for the same volume I have a more profitable NII, I'm generating a lot more capital. So more capital with profitability of NII, more capital with fees. That is improving the healthiness of our organic capital generation and profitability. At the same time, in certain cases, for example, to increase the profitability of NII, we are exiting loans that are, let's say, subpar in terms of profitability. In that case, the exit of loan releases capital because we're no longer lending. We lose the revenue, but we are disproportionately impacting positively the capital. So this trajectory continues to bring home results. What I have said before is that there is a point where the entire organic capital generation is going to be linked to the quality of a net profit and no longer to the exit of subpar loans because we will be at optimal and that will happen somewhere in the next 18 months. So organic capital generation, we have will trend line and then stop at a hopefully small discount to the net profit we do in the year. But I do think that -- so can there be more RWA reductions in the second part of the year? Yes, because we continue to grind through nonprofitable exposures. And we're doing everything we can to take this year all the things that we need to take in terms of efficiency. So when Basel IV rolls in next year, we start from a higher capital level as we possibly can. I'll leave the rest to Stefano?\nStefano Porro: Yes. So interaction with ECB on the leveraged loan topic are still ongoing. Having said that, as always, we do, the cost of risk advance below 20 is including all the relevant formation, so including, let's say, our assessment in relation to this specific topic. With regards to organic capital generation, on top of what Andrea just said, consider what we have done in first half, right? So in the first half, we've done 234 basis points. So if you are looking the first half and then the expectation of profitability on one hand and other capital efficiency action that we are expecting to do was appropriate for us to move up the organic capital generation guidance above 350.\nOperator: Gentleman, that was the last question. Back to you for any closing remarks you may have.\nAndrea Orcel: Thank you very much for your time, and see you all in the road show and interaction in the next few days.

        "text": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. It is with great pleasure that we announce our second quarter and first half 2024 results. This mark the historic achievement for UniCredit in its journey to set a new benchmark for banking, 14 consecutive quarters of profitable growth, delivering a record quarter and a record first half. These results are a testament to the unwavering commitment of our team with disciplined execution of our long-term vision and strategy and our dedication to creating value for all our stakeholders over time. The track record we have built in the last 3.5 years is undeniable. We are confident that our action will further propel our positive performance in the future, setting UniCredit to part as an attractive investment opportunity. We have delivered consistently outstanding results across all KPIs: growth, profitability, efficiency and distributions outpacing our peers. These achievements are down to clarity of direction, disciplined execution and the proactive steps we take to prepare for the future. UniCredit has transformed into a blue-chip bank with value still to unlock, lots of it. One defined by both resiliency and profitable growth. Resiliency through the cycle, leveraging our lines of defense and maintaining a quality-driven approach. Profitable growth through quality earnings and excellence in operational and capital efficiency all propelling our best-in-class distributions. Our past is marked by transformation. Our present by superior sustainable performance. Our future by our continuing to unlock significant potential. This performance is down to our mindset. It is the essence of how we engage with our clients and how we do business. This is the 14th consecutive quarter of quality growth, driven by our focus on profitable NII, increased fees and improved operational and capital efficiency, all leading to superior return on tangible equity and organic capital generation to support best-in-class distribution. Given the backdrop of rates and pass-through normalization, the profitable growth in gross NII of 5% in the half and 2% in the quarter is impressive. Overall, cost of risk remained well below our target at 5 basis points for the half and 1 basis points for the quarter, thanks to continued significant write-backs again, underscoring the conservativeness of our provisioning policy. As such, net NII dynamics mirrored those of gross NII. Our fee income grew 6.6% in the half and an impressive 10% in the quarter, thanks to our investments in people, fees in people and with fee-to-revenues reaching 33% and 34%, respectively. Our focus on operational efficiency, while investing, and capital efficiency, while targeting profitable growth, continue to set the standard for the industry. Absolute costs declined by 1.2% over the 6 months and 1.7% accelerating in the quarter. With our cost-to-income ratio further improving to 36.3%, 2.9 percentage points better than a year ago. Our net revenue to RWAs reached 9.1% in the quarter, up 1 percentage point from a year ago. RWAs were further reduced to \u20ac277 billion. It is the combined performance across all these levers but allowed us to reach a record return on tangible equity of 13% CET1 of circa 23.5%, 20% reported for both the half and the quarter, a record organic capital generation of \u20ac6.7 billion or 234 basis points for the half, supporting accrued distribution of \u20ac5.25 billion or 100% of net profit, while increasing our CET1 ratio to 16.2. A net profit growth of 20% for the half and 16% for the quarter. In the half, our EPS increased by 36%, our accrued EPS by 53% and our tangible book per share by 20%. These results are built on strong foundation across leading capital levels, sound asset quality and strong liquidity ratio. Let's now look at the P&L in further detail. Let's start with net revenues. Net revenues increased 7% to \u20ac12.6 billion in the half and 6% to \u20ac6.3 billion in the quarter. This is a result of a resilient, best-in-class NII, well above the cost of equity, a top-tier fee to revenue ratio with strong upside potential, a structurally lower and less volatile loan loss provision and continued solid trading. NII, net of provision play the critical role in our P&L., and we have focused on keeping it well above our cost of equity and resilient. We now have a RoAC above 20% in the quarter in NII. While this number will normalize on the back of lower rates and higher cost of risk, we have laid the foundation for value-accretive growth thereafter, always exceeding our cost of equity. Gross NII and margins are slightly down quarter-on-quarter as rates have started reducing. Pass-through has continued to increase, loan volumes have now recovered, and we focus on profitability. Strong management of the pass-through with an increase of only 1.4 percentage points to 31.5%, driven mainly by Germany with a skew to corporates and Central Europe, driven by Austria. Italy pass-through increased by less than 1 percentage point. Deposit volume stabilized Q-on-Q. We have continued to improve our lending mix as we move towards higher profitability and crossover segments. Those that bring us both corporate and retail clients with significantly diversified needs. Asset quality. Our NPE ratio has improved quarter-on-quarter, and we remain well covered. Our overlays to protect the future remain outsized and higher than the industry. The decline from 1.8% to 1.7% is a rounding equal to \u20ac25 million. Our overall cost of risk remains low, reflecting where we are in the cycle and benefiting from substantial write-backs. We witnessed continued significant write-backs across our entire franchise. Germany cost of risk run rate increased year-over-year as it may be earlier in the cost of recycle. Italy is broadly stable versus a year ago, while Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia saw significant net reversal in the half. Conservative past provisioning, leading to very significant write-backs enabled Russia to absorb half of the impact of a single name legal provision in risk and charges. As such, it may be interesting for you to consider our cost of risk together with single NIM risk and charges, which would raise the 1 basis point for the quarter to circa 19 basis points. Cost of risk, excluding Russia, was 12 basis points. For the half, broadly in line year-over-year and 11 basis points for the quarter, up 5 basis points year-over-year. We reaffirm our guidance of a cost of risk below or well below 20 basis points for the year, as we still plan for the start of the normalization of the cost of risk cycle and potential further precautionary provision in the second half. This is just a precaution at this point. Fees. Fees increased 7% in the half and 10% in the quarter as a result of our investments in product factories and renewed client appetite. These were propelled by clients rebalancing their portfolio ahead of the expected rate normalization and benefited from the renegotiation of some contracts in asset management and in payments. While we remain confident in our fee growth prospects and this strong cash should not be annualized. We have taken a measured and disciplined approach to further streamline our organization through the redesign and automation of processes and reducing bureaucracy. Our \u20ac1.1 billion of integration costs charged last year is allowing us to maintain our efficiency leadership while investing. Costs declined 1.2% in the half and 1.7%, therefore, accelerating in the quarter, with cost to income further improving to 36.3%. Our continued focus on operational efficiency has allowed us to invest in people, hiring, training, attractively rewarding and retaining our talent. And in our business, enhancing our product factories and digital capabilities. We intend to continue this investment whilst keeping the like-for-like cost base broadly flat going forward. Our best-in-class organic capital generation of \u20ac6.7 billion in the half and \u20ac3.3 billion in the quarter has allowed us to accrue 100% of net profit for distribution while increasing CET1 to 16.2% versus 15.7% like-for-like 1 year ago. Our disciplined focus on quality net revenue growth ensuring a net NII RoAC above cost of equity and an increasing ratio of fee to revenues, complemented by an obsessive focus on operational and capital efficiency of a key to maximizing profitability and organic capital generation while growing, maintaining best-in-class ordinary distribution without denting capital. This is a competitive advantage that will guide us going forward as we strive to support excellent ordinary distribution without denting CET1. Excess capital deployment will be additive to that. As we look at our regions and product factories, I would remind you of the differentiated strengths and value add that each of these bring to the overall group. UniCredit is much more than the sum of its part. Italy. Our Italian business had another excellent quarter, demonstrating its ability to deliver sustained quality profitable growth and outstanding returns well above peers. Net revenue rose 5.5% to \u20ac5.6 billion in the half and 3.7% in the quarter. NII was up 8% in the half and 3.3% in the quarter, thanks to strict management of the pass-through and continued rebalancing in our lending mix. Cost of risk remained mild at 28 basis points for the half and 23 basis points for the quarter, also benefiting from continued write-backs. Fees were up 7% in the half and 10% in the quarter, with all of our factories contributing but with particular strength in investments, in protection, in payments and in corporate finance. Italy is growing its assets under management and gaining market share in bank insurance and to a lesser extent in certificates as our advisory activity supports customer deploy additional investment in the right products. Hence, we have a greater impact from volume than from margin given certificate higher margins and upfronts. But we believe that this is the right strategy at this moment and will pay dividends in the future. Cost rose 0.6% in the half and 0.3% in the quarter, a structural savings from continued simplification and streamlining offset most of the inflation and investment in the business growth, including 550 new hires in the network and 350,000 hours of training to our people. RWAs were reduced by \u20ac12 billion or 10% half-on-half. Italy further strengthen its operating and capital efficiency with its best-ever 33.9% cost-income ratio and 10.6% net revenue to RWA. Profit before tax rose 16% to \u20ac3.4 billion in the half and 14% to \u20ac1.8 billion in the quarter. RoAC reached 32% in the half and 33% in the quarter. Italy generated \u20ac3 billion of organic capital in the half. Germany. Germany's profitability is the best in a decade, supported by excellent operational efficiency. Net revenue fell 3.6% to \u20ac2.7 billion in the half and 2.6% in the quarter. Germany quarterly NII would have been flat, adjusting for the impact of higher funding costs of our group trading portfolio, which was driven by higher volume. Overall, NII was down 10% in the half and 11% in the quarter. Being predominantly a corporate bank with a pass-through level on deposit near to 50%, Germany future sensitivity to rate normalization is fairly low. Cost of risk remained more elevated than the trend line at circa 20 basis points as our franchise is more sensitive to single name files and the country may or may not be earlier in the credit cycle. Fees were down 1% in the half, but up 3% in the quarter as performance accelerated across all categories, especially in investment, plus 18%, payment, plus 5%, nearly offsetting the lower client hedging fees compared to previous year's extremely high client demand. Germany had the most scope in rationalizing its corporate center and continues to do so. Costs were reduced 7 percentage points in the half and 6% in the quarter while continuing to fund investments. RWAs were reduced by \u20ac7 billion in Germany or 9% half-over-half. Germany continued to improve its operating and capital efficiency with a 39.2% cost-income ratio and 8% net revenue to RWA setting records. Pretax rose 18% to \u20ac1.6 billion in the half and 12% to \u20ac740 million in the quarter. RoAC remained at or above 20% for both the half and the quarter. Germany delivered \u20ac1.4 billion of organic capital generation in the half. Central Europe. Central Europe's profitability continues to be driven by strong revenue and disciplined cost control. Net revenue rose 5.5% to \u20ac2.2 billion in the half, but were down 0.8% in the quarter. NII was up 5.9% in the half and 1.4% in the quarter despite a downward trend but is expected to accelerated due to lower rates and higher pass-through. Cost of risk had net reversal of 5 basis points in the half and loan losses of 9 basis points in the quarter. Fees were up 11.5% in the half and 13% in the quarter, thanks to strong investment in Austria and a large advisory mandate in the Czech Republic. Business initiative across all segments should support this trend. Going forward, revenues will be more visibly impacted by the downward trend of interest rates, partially offset by strong contribution from fees performance. Costs grew by only 1.8% in the half due to wage drift, partially compensated by efficiency activities, enabling us to also continue investment in digitalization. RWAs were reduced to \u20ac1.2 billion -- by \u20ac1.2 billion or 2% in the half. The disciplined focus on operating and capital efficiency continued across all countries reflected in a 36.5% cost-to-income ratio and 7.4% net revenue on RWA ratio. Pretax rose 17% to \u20ac1.3 billion and 1% at \u20ac700 million in the quarter. RoAC was 24.3% in the half and accelerated to 26.2% in the quarter, and the region delivered \u20ac1.3 billion of capital organically in the half. Eastern Europe, outstanding profitability continued at pace this quarter, driven by excellent revenues and strong operational efficiency. Net revenues rose 21% to \u20ac1.5 billion in the half, increasing 26% in the quarter. NII was up 17% in the half and 12% in the quarter. Thanks to strong business growth across the region, a favorable rate environment and good pass-through control. Cost of risk, a net reversal of 59 basis points in the half due to continued write-back and a profitable NPE disposal and underscoring once more the conservativeness of our provisioning. Cost of fees were up 13% in the half, 14% in the quarter, driven by all categories. Going forward, revenue is expected to remain broadly stable despite a downward trend in interest rates, thanks to strong commercial activity, focused on profitable and capital-efficient business. Costs grew 3.4% in the half, offsetting most of the region, high inflation, whilst we continue to invest in our people and in digitalization. Our focus on operating and capital efficiency was reflected in a 30.3% cost-to-income ratio and 10.2% net revenue on RWA ratio in the half. Pretax grew 32% to \u20ac1 billion in the half and 35% to more than \u20ac550 million in the quarter. RoAC exceeded 40% in both half and quarter with a region delivering \u20ac600 million of capital organically in the half. Client Solutions. Turning to our product factory. Strong performance across the board. Client Solutions revenue grew by 7% in the half to \u20ac5.8 billion, 2/3 of which is fees. Corporate Solutions revenues rose by 4% to \u20ac2.7 billion in the half, driven by advisory and financing up 9%. Payment Solutions rose by 6% to \u20ac1.3 billion, driven by payments, up 14%. Individual Solutions rose by 13% to \u20ac1.7 billion, driven by investment up 17%. Onemarkets grew to \u20ac8 billion in AUM, confirming our business proposition. Our transformation from laggard to leader is due to the consistent delivery across all metrics, regions and products. We have moved from a bank languishing in the bottom quadrant to one in the top quartile, defined by quality revenues, profitability, organic capital generation and distribution metrics, consistently outperforming our core peers for 9 consecutive quarters. Our disciplined focus on quality profitable growth over volumes naturally constrained our net revenue and net profit growth versus peer with a greater volume focus. Regardless, we move close to leadership position in both cases. Our strategy aims to excel in net revenue over RWA, organic capital generation, which ultimately supports distribution, cost-to-income ratio and return on tangible equity. Here, we move to and retain clear leadership outperforming all peers. We have significant further room to add value, and you will see that going forward. Moving to tomorrow. Today, we're a completely different bank, one that has demonstrated its ability to consistently deliver. Our remarkable performance has propelled our total shareholder return and market cap rose to the top of the sector, while we continue to invest in the future, and we have just begun. We will build on this momentum, continue to deliver accretive profitable high-quality growth over volume, underpinning best-in-class distribution, outperformed our benchmarks and ultimately secure a valuation that truly reflects our worth. We're not just prepared for the future, we're shaping it. We have the resilience, the flexibility and the ability to adjust to extenuating circumstances without impacting our overall performance, and this quarter is not an exception. Our people and our winning culture will unlock even greater value in the future. Our commitment to our stakeholder remains unchanged. We aim to become the bank for Europe's future, empowering communities to progress and setting a new benchmark for banking. This is the guiding star that unites and inspire us all at UniCredit. We shall continue to strive for the best outcome for our 3 stakeholders. By putting our clients and community at the very heart of everything we do, we are transforming our organization from the ground up. Our client success is our success and their satisfaction is our ultimate reward. Our people represent the true value of UniCredit. We empower them, invest in them and foster an environment where they can thrive. Their dedication and passion are the driving forces behind our achievements, and we are committed to supporting them. Our investors provide us with the financial resources to achieve our objectives, and we are committed to protect their interest and deliver the highest sustainable returns and distribution to reward them. Our profitability and distribution yields are the best in the peer group, achieved without compromising our capital, asset quality and liquidity strengths. The vision and this commitment will not change. Our strategy also remains unchanged, specifically designed to play to our strengths and address our weaknesses. It is composed of a set of levers which we can flex depending on the needs of the business, the growth opportunities and the external environment. It is the combination of those levers that allows us to evolve over time, while being consistent to our vision and objectives. We have put our clients back at the center that has shaped a new business model. We have progressively redesigned our organization turning in on inside, we have redesigned our processes, way of working, aiming to achieve excellence in efficiency, leveraging our scale in technology, in data, in operation, in procurement, in training and in product offering to deliver with speed and quality. We are uniting and empowering our people around one vision, one winning culture, one set of principle and value, and we are supporting them with the right organization and tools. We're developing best-in-class product factories, alone or with strategic partners, to deliver the best financial services, product to 15 million clients across Europe by increasingly integrated distribution channel freely selected by our clients. We're investing in best-in-class technology and data, evolving our operation to continue to secure efficiency while enhancing our clients and on people experiences. Our strategy is underpinned by clear financial targets, delivered through an optimal balance of our 3 financial levers. Given the changed environment and our ongoing transformation, we have shifted or are shifting our focus to quality top line growth while maintaining leadership in asset quality, in capital and in operational expense. To grow our top line in a quality way, once freight and cost of risk normalize, we will continue to tilt the mix of our lending towards high net NII RoAC products and segments while fulfilling our clients' broader needs. This will also drive fee growth, supported by investment in our people, in our factories, in our distribution channels and in our technology. Doing so, we will maximize our capital efficiency, enhance capital generation and profitability, powered by our improvement in operational excellence. Our dedicated approach to quality over volume and our proactive buildup of lines of defense result in a uniquely resilient bottom line and confidence in our long-term outlook. Given headwinds, this result could have been expected to go in the opposite direction, they didn't. Our cost of risk is defined by quality focus and a conservative approach, and we have still \u20ac1.7 billion overlays to further support our cost of risk. In cost, we continue our obsession with efficiency, holding \u20ac1.5 billion of buffers already sustained from nonoperating items last year. In capital, we focus on optimal capital allocation and a superior profitability portfolio mix with \u20ac6.5 billion of excess capital, protecting total distribution and/or allowing for strategic flexibility to further propel net profit through inorganic and now with Vodeno-Aion organic external growth. Our task now is to maintain our leadership across all these levers. But our new focus is to be in a unique position on NII as our approach gives us a very high quality and profitable top line whose growth is now the central focus of our strategy. Without changing strategy, we now shift our focus from the operating machine to the commercial machine. Our commitment to quality over volume and our diversified footprint have resulted in NII growth that aligns with our European peers. But with net NII RoAC, having grown by 3x and its resilience enhanced by the shift in our lending mix. Our future in fees looks bright, given the momentum and the further impact of our past and planned investment and internalization. The combination of the higher resilience of NII and above-market growth of fees gives us confidence on the future top line trajectory. The strong foundation, proven track record and diversified levers to generate fee-based growth above market rates uniquely position us for the future. Vodeno-Aion. Through our investment in Vodeno-Aion, UniCredit acquires. Firstly, Vodeno's next-generation cloud-based core banking technology, fully competitive with best-in-class providers such as [food machine] [indiscernible] Scalable and flexible offering a comprehensive suite of digital banking products across multiple channels. We are welcoming 200 technology engineers, developers and data scientists as well as a management team with a strong track record in banking and technology implementation. Through Aion, we acquired a small bank incorporated in Belgium, whose legacy technology and clients have already been successfully migrated to Vodeno, and that already operate through a branch structure in Poland, Germany and Sweden. It is the combination of Vodeno and Aion that provides them with a competitive advantage vis-a-vis pure technology providers and fintechs. This investment propels UniCredit into a new realm of technology development and digital banking, ensuring a strong differentiation from pure technology providers, neobanks and incumbents undergoing digital transformation. Going forward, UniCredit will be able to leverage Vodeno's technology and talent to further develop this now proprietary technology and use it as a sandbox for a number of technology innovations. We can use Aion to profitably and quickly enter targeted client segments for entire markets across Europe, providing additional opportunities to deploy our excess capital. This is our third route. Vodeno and Aion will continue to target embedded finance services to marketplaces, e-commerce retailers, travel, health care and education platform and banking as a service to -- for selected fintechs. We aim to start with a project on Poland, considering the significant level of synergies with our other European markets and the credibility and experience of the Vodeno and Aion management team in the area. We will come back to you with further detail once the project is fully fledged. We're investing \u20ac370 million in cash for 100% of Vodeno, Aion with an expected impact on our CET1 of circa 15 basis points. The P&L impact of the consolidation will be dependent on the level and speed of additional investment that we made to develop this technology and these franchises, and we will communicate it to you in due course. We expect to close by year-end, subject to regulatory approval. I may add, we have no intention of integrating Vodeno-Aion. They will be like our 14th bank providing us with selective technology and organic growth opportunity through start-ups in various markets and marketplaces. I will now provide you with an update on Russia. Our strategy has been clear since day 1, working towards an ordinarily solvent, wind down as quickly as possible, always without both the letter and the spirit of a complex legal, regulatory and sanction limitation. At each and every step we have held true to our values, determined to do right by our principles and reputation, even if capitulating to pressure would have been the easier pass at the time. We remained determined not to take action, but by breaching local laws and regulation provide Russia with a justified motive to intervene and take control of our local asset and the value that comes with it. Facts speak to themselves. We have significantly reduced our activity since the first quarter of '22, particularly those not related to Western companies. Cross-border exposure is down 93% from \u20ac4.5 billion to \u20ac300 million, while minimizing our loss to 11% of principal. Local loans are down 68% from \u20ac7.3 billion to \u20ac2.3 billion. Local deposits are down 69% from \u20ac8.3 billion to \u20ac2.6 billion. And cross-border payments are down 56% from \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac11.2 billion. I remind that as all of our economies continue to purchase selective materials from Russia, those materials go through the payment system of 3 banks. In doing so, we have also absorbed the drag on our growth and profitability. And more importantly, we reduced the capital impact of a full write-down of Russia from circa 130 basis points on a 14% CET1 to circa 50 basis points on a 16.2% CET1, transforming it from very significant to non-substantial. Looking ahead, our ultimate goal is clear and unwavering, and we believe fully consistent with the expectation of our regulator. We will continue to drive down our exposure to Russia, and are continuing as we speak. Our existing plan foresees the following targets for 2025. Cross-border exposure, practically 0, with 100% reduction. Local loans below \u20ac1 billion with an 85% reduction. Local deposits, below \u20ac2 billion with in excess of 75% reduction. Cross-border payment to \u20ac8.5 billion, with more than a 66% reduction. Recently, we were advised by the straightforward implementation of recent instruction by the ECB may be inconsistent with our legal framework in certain area or conflicting with other duties. Given the seriousness of the potential consequences involved, we have sought legal clarity from the European Court of Justice to protect UniCredit from unnecessary risks, including potentially providing Russia with a justified motive to intervene and take control of our local asset and the value that comes with them. We welcome the ECB's recent openness to further clarify the request, have of any ruling and remain open to withdraw our request to the ECJ, should their clarification provide us with a necessary legal comfort. Should it be necessary for the proceeding to continue, we consider an institutional win any ECJ ruling regardless of the outcome as we would have confirmed the legality of the past, we have been ordered and the rule of law in all of our actions. Let's move to guidance. The strong start to the year allows us to increase our net revenue guidance to over \u20ac23 billion from circa \u20ac22.5 billion. This is thanks to the strong performance across all revenue lines and higher expectation for the full year skewed more towards net interest income. Our operational and capital efficiency results are also ahead of plan as we have front-loaded a number of initiatives. We have chosen not to upgrade our net profit and return on tangible guidance at this time as we retain flexibility to further support our future performance as we have done every year. However, I want to be clear, putting aside that flexibility, our underlying performance is sent to substantially exceed or in other words, blow out our net profit and return on tangible guidance. This is the same conservative approach we have taken so far. Our 2025 and 2026 ambition remains steady and confirm. We are well positioned to continue our trajectory of sustainable profitable growth and outsized distribution. And if this -- and it is the sustainability of high growth and high profitability and high distribution that provides the value of UniCredit. In conclusion, we have again demonstrated the effectiveness of our UniCredit unlock strategy. Our metrics of growth, efficiency, capital generation, profitability and distribution set a benchmark for our industry. We have moved from a restructuring story to a blue-chip bank with superior growth and distribution prospects. We face the future with the same strategy shifting our emphasis from our efficiency KPIs, which we shall defend, to our top line quality growth KPIs. We have leading profitability and distribution, strong line of defense and more than \u20ac6.5 billion of excess capital that protect or further propels our profitability and distribution depending on the opportunity. We have plenty of runway and are excited to show what we can do when rates and cost of risk normalize. The team has demonstrated again and again their ability to come through, and they continue to surprise even me. I would not want to bet against them. Both our price to earnings and price to distribution multiples remains at a substantial discount to not only top peers but also to the broader sector, particularly when considering our fundamentals and the comfort provided by our line of defense and excess capital. We offer a unique investment opportunity at an attractive entry point. Thank you all, and we shall open for questions."

        "text": "I wonder if you could please reiterate your NII income guidance without Russia. And as just said, you have built a very large implied net profit cushion. Should we then read the implied cushion in your net profit guidance as the eventual actions that could come or Russia later on and that are unforeseeable at the moment or it is more to smoothen year-on-year profitability '24 and '25 and '26."

        "text": "I will start, and Stefano will finish. So our NII guidance has been increased to in excess of \u20ac23 billion. Our fee guidance for the moment is remaining the same. We have been proven wrong in as much as this was the same thing we told you in the first quarter when we thought that the jump in fees could not be replicated in the second quarter. It was actually not only replicated, it jumped further up with an acceleration. We are cautious. This is part of the culture of this organization in replicating that in the second year because a number of these movements are due to clients going ahead of the expected normalization of rates and rebalancing their portfolio. So when this rebalancing will finish and what comes next is now speculation. So we think it is the prudent things to do to not double the first half into a second one in terms of fee. Therefore, we keep it unchanged with, I would say, an upside risk. Which goes back to the cushion, more than the cushion, I would refer you to what we did in '21, to what we did in '22, to what we did in '23. We have a tendency to exceed our guidance, and we have a tendency to also put down the foundation to continue to grow from what becomes then a pretty high bar. And at this point in time, the right thing to do is to tell you, we are going to be above \u20ac8.5 billion. We are going to beat the 16.5% return on tangible equity. We are going to beat on cost, but how much is premature, because we would like to use some of that, as you called it, cushion, to potentially further propel the profitability that is already quite ambitious for '25, '26 and beyond. So it's not a -- there is a cushion. It's very difficult for us to tell you what is the number. What the numbers that we can give you, but maybe not number, but direction we can give you, is that if I take away what you call a cushion, the underlying is obviously marching well above \u20ac8.5 billion and well above 16.5%. With respect to Russia, we continue to compress the franchise there. And we have had a number of legal cases like everybody else. This one is, just to be clear, has -- is the last one in terms of guarantees that we provided over the last significant ones. And again, we are not sure of the outcome. The outcome could be, a, that we get hit; b, but legally, we have claim on the clients we guaranteed it is premature to tell you that. So -- but for the time being, Russia has demonstrated that it had significant buffers without touching our overall overlays to absorb the shock. So Russia is not driving what we're saying about net profit and return on tangible equity."

Having said that, the contribution of fees is not material. If you go beyond 2024, we are dealing with center-like below \u20ac100 million, while as we have stated more than once, especially starting from second part of this year, but also '25, the reduction of net interest income in Russia will be a few hundreds million."

But if you can give us a little bit of color in terms of the pass-through levels you're expecting on lending and deposits as rates starts compounding, and any geographical color basically would be helpful. And specifically on this, I mean, we're seeing deposit cost in Germany, and I'm guessing Austria still going up, obviously, I mean, that might become a tailwind when rates start going down. So the question is how quickly do you think you can reprice your deposits in those 2 countries to start protecting the net interest income as rate start going down."

We are at 28% in Eastern Europe, and we are above 46% in both Germany and Central Europe, including Austria. In terms of trend we saw in the quarter an increase of around 1% in Italy and Eastern Europe and around 3% up in Germany and Central Europe. Now if you look all in all, the deposit cost, the deposit costs didn't move up so much. So we are dealing with a few basis points when you're looking at the absolute amount. The composition is there is very different because in Italy, we have a 95% side deposit, while take, for example, Germany or Central Europe, we have 55% and 60%, respectively. That means that the reduction of the Euribor and the connected repricing will happen especially in Germany and in Austria. How long does it take? I mean, it will be already in the second part of the year, consider that the average maturity of term deposit is a range between 3 months and 5 months. So taking that in consideration with a slight delay, we will have repricing down. So what we can expect in overall cost of deposit, absolute rate at year end, below the level of second quarter."

Germany and Central Europe are predominantly corporate. So the sensitivity is very different in the 3 blocks, if you call them this way. So Germany and Central Europe benefit much less and are much more sensitive going up because they reprice quickly. Hence, the pass-through that is so high. But when it goes down, they also can reprice faster because there is more scope to reprice on the deposit side. So I think the group altogether is quite balanced. But if you took those two, they behave differently from the other two."

        "text": "For the time being, if you remember, we said that our distribution policy is set on 2 things, more than 90% -- for normal distribution -- sorry, for ordinary distribution, let me rephrase. For ordinary distribution, at least 90% of net profit, and secondly, not exceeding our organic capital generation because we think that, that is the prudent things to do for ordinary. What we do with strongly, i.e., the excess capital is on top and separate. And to date, we have never used our excess capital to pay our distribution. We have actually accumulated more of it. So I would say that the distribution for the end of the year will be consistent with those metrics and therefore, depending on where we land in terms of net profit and organic capital generation, we will act accordingly on the ordinary side. On the nonordinary side, i.e., the excess capital that is a judgment call, and we have told you that between '24 and '27, we will either deploy it or return it in full. We also told you that this year, we're targeting \u20ac8.6 billion of distributions based on the metrics that I just gave you of net profit and organic capital generation and that we feel that we can repeat that or exceed it in '25, in '26 -- and in '26. And we stay firm on those numbers. As of today, we have accrued 100% of our net profit, so not 90%, 100%, \u20ac5.25 billion, but 60% of the \u20ac8.6 billion we wanted to distribute. And obviously, we've done that with an organic capital generation that exceeds that. That's why our CET1 has moved up year-on-year or has moved up since the end of the year where we were at 15.9%. So that is consistent. We're not moving."

But does getting that capability inside the group also make you think at all about touching your own core. I know you've been a bit reluctant in the past to take that step. But are there things you'd be able to do to the UniCredit systems now inside the group that perhaps you were a bit -- were a bit too difficult to do previously? And then second, clearly, is running well ahead of where you target it in the medium term? And if we take the commentary around flattish costs over the next couple of years as well as what we can see rates and fees, does it feel like that level of profitability needed to reset significantly lower. So if we think about the financial guardrails of any potential acquisition, could that greater than 15% RoTE hurdle rate be adjusted higher if your view on the medium-term returns for UniCredit turns more constructive, i.e., does better organic performance today raise the bar on what you look for in potential deals tomorrow?"

        "text": "So Chris, let me take in reverse order. I think I'm already criticized enough to be to discipline on M&A. If you want to increase my hurdle rate, you will have to deal with a lot of people. But that said, we think we can beat now seriously the 15% over a cycle. And it is clear that when we look and when we are accountable to our shareholders, we look at the returns -- the risk returns of buying back our own stock versus what we get through acquisitions, and we take a balanced view. It is also true that if you continue to buy your own stock and never grow, we are growing at the moment, but never grow through in organic growth, at one point, you stop growing. And therefore, we're not there. We are actually quite far from there, but we always balance these things. So I would say that we remain constructive on M&A, but we remain very disciplined on M&A. And more than the hurdle rates, I would say that with normalization of rates and provisions, we believe that not everyone has done the hard work in terms of taking integration costs on to improve their efficiency in terms of building overlays, in terms of investing in technology, in terms of a lot of things. And therefore, if profit -- if that comes through in the numbers, and valuation align or diverge in a positive fashion, then M&A will be more possible. With respect to more generally Vodeno and Aion, first thing, that I would say is the biggest mistake we could make is to integrate Vodeno and Aion. There would be nothing left. We are a phenomenal bank, but we are also a large monster. They are an agile speed boat and they should remain this way, and we will respect that. It will, however, give us a proprietary technology that has successfully transitioned a legacy bank, small one, to a new set of technology and to a new core. At this point in time, we do not expect to touch our core, too difficult, too complex and too many banks involved. We are only continuing internally to pursue our strategy and our plan to evolve all the aspects of our technology and our data and make it a competitive advantage, and we are confident we can do that. We expect to Vodeno, Aion, it is what I have said it is. We now have a proprietary cutting-edge technology, cloud-based for core banking. We also have a very flexible product suite with the ability to add new products on that core banking technology very cheaply. And together with Aion, that allows us to credibly and I underline profitably, enter -- so it's not a revenue gain, it's a profitability gain, to enter new market and be credible when we say this is a return on investment of more than 15% over the next 3 to 5 years. Something we would not have been able to do with the main bank. So as I said, consider it as 14 banks with a lot of greenfield startup opportunity but can further drive our growth. And combined with 200 engineers who have been extremely successful in building a cutting-edge technology that will allow us to not only trade that technology, not only to sell it as a service to fintech and other smaller banks, but also most importantly, challenge and help us drive improvement into our own bank, but not integrated in it, separate from it."

If we were to take that further less, that means that there's a \u20ac1 billion at net interest income outlook and the overall that the second half could be closer, if not match the first half? And the second question is on the cost guidance. Cost guidance flat [ex] perimeter changes. Could you give us an update how you expect the closing of the Romania acquisition and the insurance bank."

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "So -- and let me start with the second one, and then I'll pass it to Stefano. So on the cost guidance, what we have said at the end of last year is that, and I underline that, in spite of inflation, wage drift and a determination to keep our level of investments, we could commit to keep our cost flat on the perimeter that existed obviously from 2023 to 2026. Now broadly flat, flat. So that guidance has not changed. As you will notice, we're well ahead of our guidance as of today because we're not broadly flat. We're down 1.2% and accelerated to down 1.7% in the quarter. So our cost control at the moment is excellent, and I'm very satisfied with it. And we haven't touched our investments. So where we're going to go at the moment, we're still guiding for broadly flat to 2026 on the numbers we had in 2023. Whether we do better than that, it's too early to say. We are in the second quarter of the year. It is premature. And the only reason why we say experiment changes, it's obvious. Vodeno and Aion comes in, if we have significant growth opportunities, and we decided to take them we are going to adjust everything, but it will be with a return on investment overall in excess of 15%. We cannot guess all of that at the moment. With respect to the net revenue guidance, I would say the following. We are prudent. I would say that our net revenue guidance has upside risk. It has upside risk on net NII because while we haven't changed the guidance of cost of risk from below 20 basis points, below 20 basis points does not mean 19. Below 20 basis points mean below 20 basis points. 0 is below 20 basis points, 10 is below 20 basis points, 15 is below 20 basis points. We haven't updated it because, again, it is premature to give you a number that we can stand solid on it and beat, and therefore, we will probably update that by the third quarter. If you take our fees, as we said, we are well ahead of our trend line. But there are too many positive wins that are propelling that, rebalancing our portfolios, upfront fees, renegotiation of certain contracts, for us to tell you what is the underlying sustainable trend line for that. But if you take those numbers, they are significantly ahead. And thirdly, if you take NII even without the cost of risk, the reduction is significantly less than what we expected. So what we are doing at the moment is to tell you, look, it would be superficial for us to give you a new number without having more time to observe the trends and more solidity to back that number. But if you ask me what is the direction of travel today, of course, we are well ahead of what our guidance is today."

I mean your NII has increased only 65%, as you mentioned on the slide and deposit pass-through is higher in Germany, Austria, just trying to think about how resilient that can be going forward as a result? And how quickly -- I mean what assumption can we use for '25, '26 in deposit pass-through for Germany and Austria, given it's at 46% right now? My second question is on cost. Andrea, you mentioned in the past, more cost savings potential for the headquarters. I just wanted to check whether that -- this is already covered by the restructuring charges you booked in 2023 or so far? Or should we expect more restructuring charges to be booked by the end of this year?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "So I'll start and Stefano will give more precision. Let me start with cost. So what we're doing in cost is fully consistent to what we have been doing for the last 3 years. The fact that it came in the press was to clarify a number of perceptions, but we are executing as we had planned to execute year after year. So when we talk about, we will keep our cost broadly flat to the exit of 2023, notwithstanding which drift inflation and investment. I assure you we need to pedal very hard to do that. I don't think that there are many banks that are going to be capable to do that, especially coming from 2 years of uninterrupted decrease of cost quarter after quarter, while most of the industry has gone up. So we can do it, but it is hard. And at the moment, I would just say that we're just executing on what we're doing. If we find further opportunity to go beyond what we have promised, i.e., broadly flat to the end of '22, 2023, if we find them, and it's becoming harder because it requires much more granular organization redesign, process redesign, automation, improvement of a number of things in technology. But if we find them, and there is a justified return, but like everything else needs to exceed 15% by us taking integration cost, like we have taken them in '23 and '22 and '21 in the fourth quarter, we will consider to do that. And I think it's the right thing to do to then further propel '25 and '26 and '27. With respect to more generally on NII and everything else, I would just open with 2 things. The first thing, while we start from Italy, where a pan-European bank, why is that important? Because our NII sensitivity is way more aligned with European banks than it is with Italians. We -- Italians have been over 100% sensitivity. We've been around 50%, like Europeans. But if you are less sensitive on the way up, you're also less sensitive on the way down. And that's why I think some of the numbers that you're seeing are more resilient than we all thought they would be. The second thing is countries like Germany or Central Europe, have benefited a lot less than 50% from the rising rates. But at the same time, they will reprice and they will suffer a lot less from the decline in rates. So what you see of UniCredit is a bring to bear of all of these things together. And it is a little bit too early to say how it's going, but for the time being, our NII is being more resilient. Now let's never forget two things that where we are in the trend of -- in the level of rates. And I don't know what you forecast. But if you're looking at an exit of 2.25, 2.5 and a pass-through that will normalize, the hurdle that we all need to fight against is quite high. I would finish with one last thing because we insist on it because we think it's very important, maybe not everybody finds it important. The profitability as NII as a line item, so of lending as a line item is often overlooked. And we looked at the overall profitability. But if a bank has 60%, 70%, 80%, 75% of NII, and is actually subsidizing the rest of the business by going below the cost of equity or by not maximizing the profitability of NII by going on volume. I could get you higher NII in terms of volume, you will see declining return on tangible, reclining organic capital generation, declining distribution over time. We're not doing that. But that also means that we have drawn less than others or than what we could have done and that puts us in a more resilient position than others. The final thing is we've discussed it many times, the lending mix, which is another thing you should all consider. We started with a lending mix that was secured from a risk standpoint, but with a return on that lending that was way subpar. We have moved that mix. What have we done? For example, in Italy, we have deemphasized mortgages. We have pushed on consumer. We've pushed on SMEs. Obviously, that means that your volumes are growing less because mortgages, large corporates are large volumes. SMEs, consumer are small volume. However, you're shifting your portfolio to something a lot more resilient and where margins are much higher. We've been doing that for 2 years, and we're doing it this year. And when we exit, we hope that the renewed growth now no longer net of what we're not doing on the large volumes item and the profitability will emerge in our P&L. So all of these pieces are getting organized to try and minimize the impact of our net revenues because we recognize that while we have the other lines positive, like cost, like cost of risk, et cetera, et cetera, we cannot compensate only with those lines, what will happen when rates normalize and cost of risk normalize, which is why we all are looking forward to the challenge and the competition of how we deal with that versus the sector."

        "speaker": "Stefano Porro",
        "text": "So adding some data points, sensitivities. Solid sensitivities in relation to interest income are confirmed. So the interest rate-related one, plus minus 25 basis points at \u20ac140 million. And you can also expect such a sensitivity to be slightly lower during the course of '25 as highlighted by Andrea. The deposit pass-through sensitivity, 1 percentage point confirmed at \u20ac130 million. With regards to Germany and Austria, I mentioned before, let's say, the deposit pass-through either ratio between the client rate and the short-term interbank rate that is around 46 basis points. Let's translate that into basis point number. So in Germany, the cost of our deposit is slightly below 200 basis points. In Italy, it's close to 60 basis points. This makes the difference. So that's why the repricing possibility that we have in Germany and also Austria are higher. Now you need to look with a pinch of salt in relation to the deposit pass-through because when the rates will go down, technically speaking, the deposit pass-through will go up, right? And then after a while, we will reprice down. This will be especially important for Germany and Austria because of the term deposit component, it will be less likely by definition to something like that in Italy because, as commented, we are already close to 60 basis points. So there is not much room to repricing down. In relation to Germany and Austria, as I told you, we are expecting to have a level of cost for the deposit lower, in the case of Germany, lower than 190, the deposit pass-through expected for '25, it will be slightly higher because there will be a part of the deposit that we cannot reprice and as a cost of that, the deposit pass-through is slightly higher. But having said that, the overall interest expenses on deposits that we will have in Germany and Austria '25 will be definitely lower."

Can you give us an idea of how much of your current book is still in -- if you want to be low average profitability? And what are the categories that you see that it could reverse earlier when the rates normalize? And the second one is on the asset quality. You have said that the guidance is below 20 basis points, that would be significantly below 20 basis points, if I understand well, between the lines. And when I look to the actual data, actually shows that the NPLs are decreasing quarter-on-quarter, in particularly on the unlikely to pay. And also, when I look at Stage 2 and Stage 1, there has been some migration and improvement of the quality. So the underlying data feeds to suggest that the situation is still quite benign. If you can give us some color on what are the trends there, that would be great."

        "text": "So thank you, Azzurra. So as you have seen, our NII profitability all the way down, so also net of provision is about 20% at the moment or is in excess. We still have about 20% of our book that has still not migrated to above cost of equity. We started with the large majority of our book. We have about 20% of our book that has not migrated. So in the next, I would say, 18 months we will never get to 100%. It's just not feasible, but we will finish that migration, and we'll have a book that is a lot higher profitability, a lot more resilient, and we will not have the grind that we have experienced from obviously many times exiting lending position that were not meeting our hurdle. With rest to asset quality. I would just say that it's premature to say how much below 20 basis points we're going to land. You are correct. Our NPEs have improved, both gross and net our coverage has improved, and we are having a positive stage migration again and write-backs as we have kept being prudent in the way we were provisioning. So there is a point where even if you have provision for caution, if your clients repays you, you get back the provisions. So I think we are, at the moment, experiencing that positive trend. So the only thing on asset quality, in my opinion, is the issue that at some point, all of these write-backs will finish because we will continue to provision conservatively. But I think in the past, we were way more worried about the future, and we provisioned a lot, and this little by little are coming back, but we will be more orderly. At the same time, we have less necessity to be cautious because of the quality of our portfolio and because we still carry I think, well over \u20ac1.7 billion of overlays. That's what it is, therefore, to avoid us having bad surprises or to release it if bad surprises don't come. Maybe Stefano wants to add?"

Can you remind us what is the deadline for the use of release of these overlays? And then when exactly do you expect to see that flat normalization in the cost of risk? The other follow-up is on your net profit comments. I know we've talked about this, but just trying to get a little bit more color. You say you don't want to continue raising the bar of the net profit to maintain some flexibility. Could this flexibility relate to any further restructuring charges from your plans to reorganize the corporate center or anything else?"

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "So we -- so overlays in inverted commas, \"Don't have a hard deadline. What they have is a causality.\" You take an overlay over a specific potential risk. We took quite a few on COVID. We've then took quite a few on the geopolitical situation with secondary effect from the invasion of Ukraine, et cetera, et cetera. So they have a cause. So you say, fundamentally, my models are backward looking. They are great, but there are certain aspects of forward-looking but are not fully captured by our models, let's be cautionary -- let's use caution and create some provision in case the effect. Once that item does not occur or it's clear that it's not occurring, you need to release the overlays. Obviously, the item occurs, you release the overlays. So either you release the overlays because the item occur and you're covering it, or you release the overlay because the item does not occur, and then it propels your returns. What we have been doing over the last 3 years, not because necessarily proactively, but just because of the volatility and the uncertainty of the future is every time a causality of an overlay led to release, and in most cases, it was a release without the risk occurring. There were other reasons why we should create new overlays. And therefore, we have pushed in time, the overlay. So consider it this way, we had plenty of overlays for COVID. When the impact from COVID did not occur. Well, for example, Russian invaded Ukraine and we had other risk, and we move those -- that causality into a new causality, but now it's kind of stabilizing. So in the next, I would say -- I don't think, for the time being, but hopefully, I'm not proven wrong, but I don't think for the time being that the second half of this year will lead to a significant release of overlays. That means that we have \u20ac1.7 billion that should be released between '25 and '26 in my opinion. It's quite difficult to see with a stabilizing environment that we can carry them anywhere further. So either potential worries occur, and we will have the buffer, or the potential worries do not occur, and we will have a propelling effect by abating our cost of risk, and it will go into the bottom line. That's why we call it a line of defense that can protect or propel. With respect to transformation, as we said, we are a transformed bank. We've done a lot. I think we're about -- we're more than halfway through. There we continue to challenge everything that we do, how we do it, to see if we can do it more efficiently, more effectively better. We continue to challenge what we do in terms of investing in our product factories, in our frontline, in our distribution channel, in our branches, both physical and nonphysical. We're now going to get to challenge what we can do organically to grow with Aion and Vodeno. So as we go through that process and I think what is right, what is impressive is the culture of UniCredit that keeps on challenging what we do and seeing if we can do it better. We find new things that we said, why didn't I think about this earlier. We should change it, we should improve it. And when we found those new things, we obviously need to invest into making the improvement, either it's an investment in, I don't know, writing-off some old technology and implementing new one, or it is about prevention some people and hire some more young people, or it is about preempting the investment in launching a new digital bank or whatever it is. When we have those things, we do, do the broad category of integration cost. We usually culminate in that thinking at the end of the year just because we -- it's difficult to do it while we're flying. And therefore, if you go back and you look, we have done integration cost in '21, we have done integration cost in '22. We have done integration cost in '23. As we became better and better anticipating and investing to push the bank further. We are working hard on seeing whatever levers and whatever things we can find. And if we find them, we will take some integration cost. There is one commitment that does not move. We will make more than \u20ac8.5 billion net profit. And we will make at least a 16.5% return on tangible. And we will distribute at least \u20ac8.6 billion. So we will not put these things at risk. But the magnitude of the beat because beat there will be is determined by how much we are going to be able to support and continue growing in '25, '26 and '27. And part of that is taking certain charges or making some investment or doing things that are all included in the integration cost line."

        "text": "So I'll start with the second one. No. It is -- so the organic capital generation is not chemistry. The organic capital generation is where do you grow. How profitably do you grow? So for example, if tomorrow -- the more we increase the mix in our revenues to fees, the more organic capital generation increases because fees do not require capital. So it's net profit that goes directly to the bottom line. With fees doing that well, implicitly, our organic capital generation increases. Secondly -- the second point which I keep on hammering is the profitability of NII, not the volume of NII, the profitability of NII. If my profitability of NII increases while I am using capital, I am generating a lot more than my profitability of NII decreases. You're looking at the profitability of our NII is increasing. And therefore, the combination of an NII that maybe in volume, you see the same volume or decline in volume, and you say, well, it's the same. No, it's not the same because if for the same volume I have a more profitable NII, I'm generating a lot more capital. So more capital with profitability of NII, more capital with fees. That is improving the healthiness of our organic capital generation and profitability. At the same time, in certain cases, for example, to increase the profitability of NII, we are exiting loans that are, let's say, subpar in terms of profitability. In that case, the exit of loan releases capital because we're no longer lending. We lose the revenue, but we are disproportionately impacting positively the capital. So this trajectory continues to bring home results. What I have said before is that there is a point where the entire organic capital generation is going to be linked to the quality of a net profit and no longer to the exit of subpar loans because we will be at optimal and that will happen somewhere in the next 18 months. So organic capital generation, we have will trend line and then stop at a hopefully small discount to the net profit we do in the year. But I do think that -- so can there be more RWA reductions in the second part of the year? Yes, because we continue to grind through nonprofitable exposures. And we're doing everything we can to take this year all the things that we need to take in terms of efficiency. So when Basel IV rolls in next year, we start from a higher capital level as we possibly can. I'll leave the rest to Stefano?"

Having said that, as always, we do, the cost of risk advance below 20 is including all the relevant formation, so including, let's say, our assessment in relation to this specific topic. With regards to organic capital generation, on top of what Andrea just said, consider what we have done in first half, right? So in the first half, we've done 234 basis points. So if you are looking the first half and then the expectation of profitability on one hand and other capital efficiency action that we are expecting to do was appropriate for us to move up the organic capital generation guidance above 350."

    "transcript": "Andrea Orcel: Good morning. And thank you for joining us today as we present another record set of results, ushering UniCredit in a new era of sustainable quality growth. I apologize in advance for my voice, but I'm a little bit under the weather. Over the last four years, UniCredit has undergone a successful transformation, achieving 15 consecutive quarters of quality growth and improvement, outperforming peers across all KPIs, and poised to establish a new sustainable run rate in 2024, a base from which we intend to grow. Our record-breaking results in Q3 and over the past nine months are further testaments to our success driven by the contribution of our people. Sustainable quality growth for us means a growing bottom line that does not sacrifice a top line of exceptional quality driven by profitable NII and growing rate of fees, combined with operational and capital excellence. This delivers best-in-class profitability and organic capital generation, enabling us to return outsized distribution to our stakeholders. This is the benchmark we intend to set. Our transformation has ushered us into a new era where the work we have undertaken to strengthen our business will become even more apparent, and the full extent of our transformation will finally be for everyone to see. With our structural strengths fuelled by unique accelerators and a clear quality growth trajectory, we are well prepared to navigate a challenging macro environment. We are excited about the future and look forward to continuing to deliver exceptional results for all our stakeholders, as confirmed by our upgraded 2024 guidance and future ambition. UniCredit Unlocked has proven to be a winning, flexible strategy built to adapt to a changing environment. Anchored by our vision of becoming the bank for Europe's future, it delivers consistent value to all stakeholders, setting a new benchmark in banking. Our strategy is entirely client-centric. We empower our people in a streamlined organization. We offer best-in-class products, both in-house and through partners, benefiting from group-wide scale. We leverage reliable digital and data capabilities to enhance the client experience, all to serve our clients where and when they need us, across a fully integrated channel. All this is underpinned by a culture of empowerment, accountability and continuous improvement. Over 15 consecutive quarters, this strategy and the dedication of our people allowed us to achieve sector leadership across key metrics. We lead in net revenue to RWA, cost-income ratio and return on tangible equity at 13% CET1. Our EPS growth and total distributions are also best-in-class. We are operating on a completely new run rate versus 2021. Our net profit is 5x higher, our return on tangible, 3x higher, our organic capital generation, 2x higher, and so are our distributions. This quarter, we again achieved impressive results, driven by our focus on profitable NII, increased fees and improved operational and capital efficiency. All this leads to superior return on tangible equity and organic capital generation to support best-in-class distributions. Given the backdrop of rates and path-through normalization, the profitable growth in NII of 3% in the nine months and almost flat performance sequentially quarter-on-quarter is particularly impressive. This performance is a direct result of our diversified geographic mix, a continued shift to higher risk-adjusted profitability clients and products, and our strict discipline on deposit path-through. Overall cost of risk remain well below our target at 9 basis points for nine months, thanks to continued significant write-backs, again underscoring the conservativeness of our provisioning policy. As such, net NII dynamics mirror gross NII. Our fee income grew 7.2% in the nine months and an impressive 8.5% in the quarter year-on-year, with fees-to-revenue reaching 33% and 32%, respectively, thanks to our investment in the business and the focus of our people on our clients. Our focus on operational efficiency while investing and capital efficiency while targeting profitable growth continue to set the benchmark for the industry. Absolute cost declined by 1.2% over nine months and 1.4% in the quarter year-on-year, with our cost-to-income ratio at industry-leading level of 36.6%, 2.5 percentage points better than a year ago. Our net revenue to RWAs reached 8.9% of circa 1 percentage point from a year ago. RWAs were reduced to EUR 278 billion. It is this combined performance across multiple levers that allowed us to reach a record return on tangible equity at 13% CET1of circa 23.3%, about 20% reported, for both the nine months and the quarter. A record organic capital generation of EUR 10.1 billion or 357 basis points for the nine months while increasing our CET1 ratio to 16.4% per investment. Net profit growth of 16% in the nine months and 8% in the quarter. In the nine months, our EPS increased by 31%, accrued DPS by 48% and tangible book per share by 20%. Let's now look at the P&L in detail. Net revenue increased 5.4% to EUR 18.6 billion in the nine months and 2.6% to EUR 6 billion in the quarter. This is a result of; one, resilient NII despite lower rates and best-in-class NII RoAC at circa 19% in the quarter, well above the cost of equity. Two, top-tier fee to revenue, which continues to gain momentum. Three, LLPs, still a low point and stable, still benefiting from right-back, confirming quality origination and conservative provisioning. Four, trading and others continues to be solid despite the impact from the Commerzbank investment. Despite the reduction in rates, we have successfully maintained a stable NII both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. This achievement is testament to our effective deposit path-through management, resulting in path-through rate of 32% in the third quarter and growth strategies in selected areas. Our focus on quality has led to constrained overall volume growth, but it has also resulted in our NII RoAC reaching approximately 19%, well above our cost of equity. This has put us in a position of strength as we weather the impact of rates normalization. This approach has been crucial in maintaining our financial stability and ensuring our continued success. Our cost of risk remained low at nine basis points for the first nine months, in line with the same period last year. This achievement is largely due to significant right-backs in Russia and elsewhere. This will eventually abate, bringing our cost of risk closer in line with our expectation. Our performing portfolio is highly covered and is of high quality. Our gross non-performing exposure stock and net NPE stock remain stable at 2.7% and 1.4% respectively. This stability reflects our discipline approach to managing non-performing exposures and maintaining a healthy balance sheet. Our fees have experienced a significant increase across all main categories, growing by 7% over the first nine months of the year and 8.7% excluding the current account and securitization cost and 8.5% year-over-year. Our fee-to-revenue ratio stands at a top tier 33%, highlighting the quality and diversification of our fee base. We continue to see strong momentum in assets under management and non-life insurance, driven by increased client appetite and a broader product offering. Payments and current account performance is driven by payment, up 6% over nine months while down 3% in the quarter due to a change in contractual incentive features in Italy. We expect to catch up by year end. Our advisory and financing services have also seen strong acceleration reflecting the benefit of our past investments and a supportive environment. We believe we are the only bank that has consistently reduced our absolute cost base during the last two years of setting inflation across our footprint while increasing revenues and investing in the business quarter-over-quarter. This quarter and nine months are no exception. We've cost down respectively 1.4% and 1.2% year-over-year. Our cost-to-income ratio has improved to 36.6%. We lead in our peer group. This achievement is a result of strong discipline combined with a targeted approach to streamlining our organization and reducing unnecessary overhead. Our operational excellence has been a key factor in our success and we intend to defend it. Our best-in-class organic capital generation of EUR10.1 billion in the nine months and EUR 3.5 billion in the quarter has allowed us to accrue 100% of net profit for distribution while increasing CET1 to 16.4% pre-investment versus 15.9% in full year 2023. This quarter, we have also absorbed the initial capital impact of various strategic investments that will propel our results in the future. These include building a stake in Commerzbank, committing towards our insurance internalization, acquisition of Aion/Vodeno and of Alpha Bank in Romania. Some further capital consumption is expected from these stakes in the future. Group RWA increased slightly as almost EUR 5 billion of reduction was more than offset by the impact of strategic investments. We expect RWA to increase by a few billion next quarter. Looking to Basel IV, the full year impact is expected at around 70 basis points as we implement mitigation action on credit risk while the initial impact in Q1\u201925 will be around 90 basis points. As we look at our region and product factories, I would like to remind you that UniCredit is more than the sum of its part. Our achievements stem from a collective effort across regions and factories, each contributing to our overall strengths, but all coming together as one group that is worth far more than the sum of its part. Italy. Italy continued to deliver high profitability and growth underpinned by earnings quality and operational and capital excellence. Net revenues were up 5% in the nine months, reaching EUR 8.2 billion with a quarter up 3%. NII was up 5% in the nine months and remarkably 1% in the quarter with rates reduction more than compensated by the continued improvement in the mix of our business and strong management of the pass-through. Cost of risk remained mild at 28 basis points for the nine months and the quarter, showing continued stability. Fees were up 7% in the nine months and 9% in the quarter with all product contributing and particular strengths in investments, non-life insurance where we continue to grow our market share and advisory capital market. Operational excellence was maintained. Costs were broadly flat in spite of the salary contract renewal, inflation and investment in growth within the business. Cost income ratio was reduced yet again to 34% in the nine months. Our focus on capital efficiency further increased our net revenue to RWAs by 1.4 percentage point to 10.5%. Profit before tax rose 17% in the nine months to reach EUR 5 billion, up 19% in the quarter. RoAC reached 33% in the nine months. The region generated EUR 4.4 billion or 156 basis points of capital organically, confirming it as a quality earnings powerhouse. Our client and community remained at the heart of our operation as we rolled out the third iteration of UniCredit per l\u2019Italia to support individuals and SMEs in navigating the continued challenging external environment. With the recent flooding in the [inaudible] region, UniCredit provided a program of financial support and flex for individual, small businesses as well as providing financial and practical help for people. The full benefit of the investment in UniCredit University became more apparent this year, increasing its access to training and up-skilling for our people. The University also played a critical part on the landmark agreement with the Italian unions which saw 600 employees moving into a bespoke risk-killing and re-deployment program. Germany. Germany remains an anchor country for UniCredit and has once again surpassed expectations delivering its best nine months and third quarter profit in over a decade. These results are thanks to continued discipline in improving the quality and profitability of our top line and the increased efficiency of our operations. These factors underscore the strengths of this franchise, both within its home country and as a core contributor to UniCredit. Net revenue was slightly down 1% in the nine months, as strong fees only partially compensated for a slight higher cost of risk. The quarter was up 6%. NII was down 5% in the nine months, driven by higher funding costs in client risk management. The quarter was up 7% as this trend started reversing. Cost of risk was marginally up in the nine months to 19 basis points, driven by two large corporate default in Q1 and Q2, mitigated by a prudent coverage ratio. Q3 was back to trend line at 16 basis points. Fees were up 2% in the nine months, accelerating to 7% year-on-year, driven by investment, financing, and payments of a strong base. Operational efficiency continued to improve, with costs down 7% in the nine months and 9% in the quarter. This led to a cost income ratio of 39.4% in the nine months. Our capital efficiency improved further, with net revenue over RWA increasing 0.8 percentage point to 8% in the nine months. Profit before tax rose 17.5% in the nine months to EUR 2.3 billion, and up 17% on a year-on-year basis, RoAC reached 22%. Germany generated EUR 2.3 billion, or 82 basis points of capital organically, in the nine months. Germany continued to deliver on its commitment to invest in its business, with a particular focus on the network. Training and up-skilling was rolled out for 1,300 employees, enabling us to retain our talent, providing the opportunity for our people to broaden their skill set and adapt to new roles in our private and corporate banking divisions. Germany was this year named top employer in Germany, and was instrumental in UniCredit being the first bank in Europe to achieve a Global Edge Certificate. It picked up seven Euromoney Awards for its performance across all of its key markets. Central Europe continues to be a dynamic region, delivering resilient growth and continuing to improve operational and capital excellence. Net revenue were up 3% in the nine months, reaching EUR 3.3 billion, driven by strong fees and resilient NII, while slightly down in the quarter due to lower rates and higher deposit path through. NII was up 1% in the nine months, remaining resilient amidst the declining rates environment. The quarter was down 8.5% year-on-year due to lower rates, higher deposit path through, particularly in Austria and Hungary, and a time delay in repricing savings accounts in Austria that shall be reversed at a later date. Cost of risk had net reversal of four basis points in the nine months due to write-backs in Q1 and Q2, while at zero basis points for the quarter. Fees were up an impressive 10% in the nine months, thanks to strong investment services and a large advisory mandate in check in Q2. Excluding such mandate, fees were up 8%. As with evolve our markets, the striving for operational excellence continued, with costs slightly decreasing in the quarter and growing by only 1% in the nine months. Cost-income ratio reduced yet again by 1% to 36.5% in the nine months, reaching 36.6% in the quarter. Our focus on capital efficiency led to an increase in our net revenue to RWA of 0.3% to 7.4%. Pre-tax profit rose 9% in the nine months to in excess of EUR 1.9 billion, resulting in a RoAC of 24%. The region generated a record EUR 1.7 billion or 61 basis points of capital organically in the nine months. As the core gross engine of the group, within our surging markets, Eastern Europe delivered again across all revenue streams. Net revenues were up 14%, reaching EUR 2.2 billion in the nine months, with flat performance in the quarter due to LLP normalization. NII was up 11% in the nine months, driven by strong commercial growth with a quarter plus 2% year-over-year, with strong business growth across the region and good path-through control compensating for rate reductions. Cost of risk had net reversal of 34 basis points in the nine months due to Q1 and Q2 write backs. Q3 cost of risk moved towards trend line at 12 basis points, as most of our write backs reduced. Fees were up 10% in the nine months, with a quarter up 5% year-over-year, driven by a positive momentum across all categories and supported mainly by client hedging fees and payments. As with all our markets, operational excellence remained a focus, balanced with investment in our business, people and technology. These commitments saw costs increase just 3.5% in the nine months and in the quarter, offsetting most of the region's high inflation due to wage drift. Cost-income ratio reduced yet again to 30.3% in the nine months, and our focus on capital efficiency further increased our net revenue to RWA by 0.3 percentage points to 9.8%. Pre-tax profit rose 20% in the nine months to EUR 1.5 billion, with flat performance in the quarter due to LLP's normalization, resulting in a RoAC just below 40%. As with all our markets, our banks across the CEE remain focused on supporting those communities within which they operate, with Austria along with Czech and Slovakia providing emergency aid packages for those sadly impacted by the recent flooding. Our cross-market partnership with Teach For All and Junior Achievement Europe, continue to receive both financial and practical support from the teams on the ground. Internally, our next generation of employees were supported through bespoke peer-to-peer training for junior and digital skill training at all levels, to ensure advanced skills and tools to thrive in a digital era. Our strategy in Russia has been to work towards an orderly solve and wind-down as quickly as possible, always within both the letter and the spirit of complex legal, regulatory and sanction limitation. Last quarter, we communicated our targets for full year 2025. We have already nearly met them. Local deposits are down 27% this quarter and 77% since Q1, 2022, from EUR 8.3 billion to EUR 1.9 billion, already below our 2025 target. Local loans are down 31% this quarter and 78% since Q1 \u201822, from EUR 7.3 billion to EUR 1.6 billion, closing on our below EUR 1 billion target for 2025. Cross-border exposure remained flat this quarter as most of the position will mature next year. Since Q1 2022, we are down 95% from EUR 4.5 billion to EUR 300 million, whilst minimizing our loss to 11% of principal. Cross-border payments are down 19% this quarter and 64% since Q1, 2022, from EUR 25.3 billion to EUR 25.9 billion, almost at our 2025 target. Cross-border payments are now strongly concentrated in U.S. dollar, cleared by JP Morgan, and euro, cleared by us. Our euro payment volumes, which account for under one-third of the total were almost 55% between Western multinationals and socially oriented companies. We have reduced the capital impact of a full write-down of Russia from circa 130 basis points on a 14% CET1 ratio in Q1 2022 to circa 50 basis points on a 16.1% CET1 ratio today. Given the progress made, we will review further next steps regarding Russia, and will communicate them in due course. Turning to our product factories, we see strong performance across the board. Client solution revenue grew by 8% in the nine months to EUR 8.6 billion. Two-thirds are fees, growing at the same pace and well-balanced across all our factories. Corporate solution revenues rose by 7% to EUR 4.1 billion in the nine months, driven by advisory and financing up 6%, 18% excluding securitization costs, and CRM up 11%. Payment solution rose by 4% to EUR 2 billion, driven by payments up 9%. Individual solution rose by 13% to EUR 2.5 billion, driven by investments up 17%. One market grew to EUR 11.6 billion AUM, also supported by the Azimut Partnership in Italy, confirming the attractiveness for clients of our offer. Our transformation has led to remarkable results. We have focused on superior quality top-line growth, coupled with best-in-class operational and capital efficiency, resulting in best-in-class profitability and distribution. By making this our focus, we have registered the highest NII RoAC at 20%, almost double the peer average. Our stated fees and insurance income growth for full year \u201821 to the first half of \u201824 was an impressive 24%, five points higher than the peer average. Additionally, our fees-to-revenue ratio for the same period was 34%, seven points higher than our peers. We have reduced our cost-income ratio to 36%, 15 points below the peer average. We have improved our net revenue-to-RWA ratio to 9%, two points above our peers. Delivering on our three levers has led to superior profitability and distribution. Our return on tangible equity at 13% CET1 ratio was over 23%, 10 points higher than the peer average. Our distribution year at circa 14% is 5 percentage points higher than our peer average. As the industry faces headwinds, UniCredit stands ready to reveal its true differential value, qualities that were previously masked by favorable market environment. We acknowledge the challenges set at NII headwinds, inflationary pressure on cost, cost of risk normalization, compression of Russia, and digital evolution, but we are confident in our ability to leverage our unique levers to overcome them. Differently from four years ago, we start from a leadership position in terms of performance. We know our strengths, our geographic client and product mix that we have been able to unify and leverage as one group. Powering this are several accelerators, the transformational initiatives in flight, our lines of defense, and our strategic flexibility. Finally, we have a quality growth trajectory which is relentlessly executed by people proven to be able to deliver alpha. Our unique geographical reach is one of our structural strengths, providing us with a diversified presence across 13 European markets. We are one federation of individually empowered banks, all executing independently, while leveraging significant cross-border flows. Simplifying, 41% of our net profit comes from Italy, a quality earnings powerhouse that combines a fee-to-revenue ratio in excess of 40%, pro forma for insurance internalization, and increasingly profitable NII with outstanding operational and capital efficiency. The next 30% comes from Germany and Austria, both highly rated economies that act as anchors of resiliency for the group, and that are well advanced in an operational efficiency and greater client-focused turnaround. The final 29% comes from Central and Eastern Europe, our proven engine for profitable growth, all within Europe, which increasingly puts our group's growth expectation at a premium to the peer group. We\u2019ve had the perfect combination of highly capital-generative and resilient regions, balanced with dynamically growing ones, all truly coming together in one group. This allows us to benefit from our global product offering, procurement, and technology infrastructure at scale, further enhancing our competitive edge. This has enabled us to occupy a dominant position across Europe with our individual leading position in each country, all significantly beating their cost of equity and connecting client across Europe like no other. Our client franchise and product mix are core to our quality growth strategy. While we maintain our focus on large corporates and mass market individual, we have been decisively tilting our client mix towards SMEs and private and affluent individual. We have also been building our factories to provide our clients with a broader array of products and services that they require. This strategy has been successful as demonstrated by our gaining market share in payments, in investments, in insurance, in consumer finance, and in trade finance. In parallel, we continue to enhance our distribution model towards a fully integrated distribution of, that combine digital innovation with personalized, human interaction in various forms. This is at the origin of the work we have done on call centers, digital branch with Buddy, physical branch, and internet and mobile. Last but not least, we're investing in our people, some of the best in the industry, retraining them where necessary at the UniCredit University, and providing them with a product, distribution channel and tool such as new risk models and client's data that they need. Whilst we have transformed into an industry leader focusing on delivering quality growth, we still have unique accelerators to propel us further. We're making transformative investment that will drive our progress and ensure we remain at the forefront of our industry. Our lines of defense are strong and ready to protect or propel our continued growth and success. Strategic investment remain a potential accelerator, helping us to achieve our goal faster, more efficiently and effectively. We're committed to making these investments, but always within our strict investment criteria. UniCredit has invested in Commerzbank, because we believe it can be a much better and stronger bank, particularly in and for Germany, better and stronger for its people, for its customer, and for its communities. This is true standalone, where most of the potential improvement lies, and even more so as a combined entity with HVB. As an industrial investor that has successfully overcome the same challenges, our aim is to see Commerzbank unlock its significant unrealized potential. Indeed, as we all know, having potential on paper is not the same as crystallizing it. UniCredit unlocked, and indeed HVB unlocked, is a blueprint of what can be done, but we are open to alternative solution and await these being outlined at Commerzbank Investor Day. As a possible additional option, the combination of Commerzbank and HVB could generate even greater value and opportunities for all employees, clients and communities. But as we said before, this will depend on the outcome of engagement with Commerzbank, its management supervisory board, as well as its wider stakeholders in Germany. A combination could offer Germany a bank operated by a fully empowered German legal entity, but could more effectively compete in its home market and beyond. It will also insert mBank and Poland within the broader UniCredit franchise, both in the CEE and Europe as a whole. mBank would be provided with a capital, product and services, and indeed client connection across our 13 countries, plus one, to accelerate its growth and achieve its full potential. For UniCredit, such a combination would further transform the group and accelerate its path to become the bank for Europe's future, whilst crystallizing significant additional value creation to our base case. Italy, Germany, Austria, and Central and Eastern Europe would have a balanced contribution to the Group and set its direction, strategy and ambition for the future, that they would then be fully empowered to individually achieve. Above and beyond what I just said, I would like to highlight a number of facts with respect to the two banks that support our strongly held views. HVB and Commerzbank, excluding mBank and the opaque assets held at Corporate Centre, are mirror images of each other. They are identical in many ways, but also highly complementary. Our respective geographic presence makes us a perfect match. HVB covers mainly the southern and the northern part of the country, while Commerzbank is mostly present elsewhere in Germany. In Corporate, we're all but the same. We both cover large corporate, as do many other banks, most Europeans through branches or U.S. banks. Whilst the combined institution would have the scale, product and services to better support large corporates in Germany, it is the Mittelstand clients who would benefit most from a combination. We would be able to provide deeper and broader support and services to these companies who are at the heart of so many German communities and are the lifeblood of the economy. Commerzbank Mittelstand clients could gain access to our market-leading suite of products and more comprehensive financing solutions, boosting their opportunity for growth domestically and internationally. Combined with our enhanced technology offering, we have the potential to become a larger, more profitable one-stop shop for the Mittelstand in Germany, across Europe and beyond. On the retail side, Commerzbank revenues are 2.1x HVB's, although HVB has 4x the revenue per retail client, both because of mix and because it can rely on our group product factories. The two banks are complementary geographically and by client segment, with HVB more focused on private wealth and affluent. The larger weight of retail in Commerzbank Germany operation would nicely balance HVB's higher weight of corporate. Having now addressed the point on similarity and complementarity of the two franchises that would support a potential combination with minimal impact on its client and frontline employees, let me now address with facts some of the other concerns that have been raised around this potential combination. Let's start with risk, both a protection of deposit and in terms of financial strengths. Far from being a concern, in the unlikely situation where deposit protection would be needed, HVB deposits are insured by the same German government deposit scheme as Commerzbank. In fact, during the crisis, HVB and UniCredit at group level continued to function without any need for government support, maintaining an orderly service to our clients. In addition, clients of both banks benefited from additional protection of company capital and other resources, which are greater in the case of HVB, both standalone and relying on UniCredit group. Indeed, both HVB and UniCredit have a greater common equity Tier 1 ratio than Commerzbank. Above 23% and 16% respectively, Commerzbank stands at 14.8%. This is further underpinned by a far greater level of profitability and efficiency at both UniCredit Group and HVB versus Commerzbank. This brings us to ratings. At group level, UniCredit has recorded a consistently steady improvement in its ratings, with Fitch only last week raising again the rating of UniCredit to one notch above Italy's on par to Commerzbank. At HVB local legal entity level, the relative comparator to Commerzbank, the two banks are practically on par, as underscored by their similar cost of funding in Germany. Finally, Moody's has already indicated that a merger far from leading to a rating downgrade could warrant a rating increase at the parent company level benefit all banks. And as it relates to concern for stakeholders, we take pride in the investment we make in our employees and the commitment we have made to reskilling and retraining all colleagues to ensure that they can grow and develop in line with our industry. Where efficiency have to be looked at, the challenging yet constructive dialogue that we have with employees' representatives, have resulted in outcomes that have worked well for all those involved. And to our clients, and the notion of overlap, far from being duplication, HVB and Commerzbank are highly complementary, so concentration should not be an issue. This client commitment is reflected in the federal nature of our business, where to be clear, the day-to-day running and decision-making for Germany occurs in Germany, and it could not be otherwise given regulation. This is also consistent with UniCredit Unlocked and our approach to empowerment of those closest to the client, or the matter at hand, as opposed to those at the center. Our shareholders have benefited from 15 quarters of consistent growth and financial rewards, repaying us with their long-term and often vocal support. Any discussion around current investment and future options must be underpinned by facts, rather than unsubstantiated views and opinions, hence the need for this clarification. If we now go back to the symmetry already outlined, all stakeholders should be able to compare relative performance of Commerzbank Germany, ex-corporate center in HVB, and HVB like-for-like, based on simple KPIs, even before discussing the benefit of a potential combination. Let me now go through a comparison of the operating performance of the two banks in Germany, as this is the real crux of the issue. If we take as reference the 2021 first half \u2013 to first half \u201824 period, that saw both UniCredit and Commerzbank deliver on their respective plans, the performance of both banks in Germany speaks for itself. HVB delivered much greater revenue growth, mostly driven by fees, achieved with much greater capital and cost efficiency. This all led to twice the net profit growth and RoAC of Commerzbank, notwithstanding Commerzbank benefiting to a much higher degree from the positive rates environment, given their greater weighting to retail. As such, HVB has been able to distribute its yearly net profit in 2022 and 2023, while increasing its CET1 to circa 24% as of the third quarter of \u201824, while Commerzbank has distributed on average over the same period, only 40% of its net profit, reaching a CET1 of 14.8%. There is no reason why Commerzbank in Germany, should not have the ambition to at least match what has been achieved by HVB, which is still progressing further as the results of today demonstrate. Our investment in Commerzbank is both strategically and financially justified given what I have just taken you through. The potential to generate substantial value for both institutions is there. The question remains whether it shall be unlocked by Commerzbank alone, through a combination or not at all. We have purposely structured our investment to provide us with optionality, to either benefit from the crystallization of Commerzbank potential or to exit with protected downside for our shareholders' benefit. We have clear managerial action that will allow us to offset the headwinds from the normalization of the environment and the compression of Russia, to eventually secure sustainable quality growth. Our aim is to further strengthen the unparalleled quality and profitable mix of our top line, increasing our fee base to 40% of total revenue, while keeping NII RoAC well above our internal cost of equity. To achieve this, we will continue our client and product mix shift, further leverage our product factories and better integrate them with our front lines. The internalization of insurance and retention of the asset management value chain will provide a further boost. We are committed to operational excellence while investing in business optimization. Our replicating strategy, and quality approach, will help us benefit from lower sensitivity to rates. We will maintain a cost of risk at 20 to 25 basis points over the cycle, also leveraging overlays. Our financial projections mean we are confident in upgrading our 2024 guidance. If we compare our performance like-for-like with our guidance at the beginning of 2024, so excluding integration and average charges and investment, we currently expect our net profit to be around EUR 10 billion, with NII more or less flat year-over-year. Like-for-like, this is more than EUR 500 million higher than 2023. That said, we anticipate closing the year with a net profit above EUR 9 billion. Although the ultimate number depends on our decision on integration and average charges, integration charges are expected to exceed EUR 500 million. There is much discussion as to the impact on the bottom line of European banking sector due to the much lower rate environment and higher cost of risk. For us, there is also the compression from Russia to be considered. As a result of our unique levers, fee and geographical diversification, and the decisive action taken over the recent year, we are confident that we will maintain a run rate of at least EUR 9 billion in each of \u201825 and \u201826. For now, that is a strong ambition of the people of UniCredit. This is a testament to how well our underlying business is performing. We expect costs to remain broadly flat in the next couple of years on the same perimeter. The perimeter as such will change as we internalize life insurance, complete the merger in Romania and integrate Vodeno/ Aion. And therefore, group fixed costs will increase, although with no impact on the net profit guidance for \u201825 and \u201826. We are increasing our return on tangible equity ambition to circa 17% and are looking to continue EPS and DPS strong growth. Annual average distribution for 2025 and 2026 of greater than for 2024 means that our shareholders will continue to be rewarded handsomely. We also have recently announced that we will increase the dividend accrual from next year to 50%, of net profit from 40%, as a sign of our confidence in the sustainability of our financial performance. And we remain with EUR 6.5 billion of excess capital, which we will return or deploy strictly within our metrics by 2027 latest. The investment case for UniCredit remains exciting and compelling. To conclude, I will leave you with five key reflections on today's results. Today's numbers reflect the output of a fully transformed bank. One that has moved away from retrenchment and is industry leading across all KPIs. These results prove the success of our UniCredit Unlocked strategy and usher in a new era of quality growth. Two, these are record results. With our best ever Q3 and nine months result, marking 15 consecutive quarter of profitable growth with improvement across all key metrics. We have upgraded our guidance for \u201824, given we are operating on a completely new run rate compared to \u201821. Our net profit is 5x higher. Our return on tangible 3x. Our organic capital generation over 2x, supporting our distribution that are more than 2x higher. This new era of sustainable quality growth will be powered by conditions that are unique to our bank. We start from a position of strengths and our structural strengths as a pan-European group are accelerated such as a strategic investment in Vodeno and Commerzbank, and our clear growth trajectory will support that quality growth. Structural strengths include unique geographic client and product mix, underpinned by empowered countries leveraging group skill and scope. Idiosyncratic accelerators defined by our continued transformation initiatives, our line of defense release and strategic flexibility which has allowed us to invest in Vodeno, Romania and Commerzbank. And our clear growth trajectory executed by people passionate about our business proven repeatedly to be able to deliver Alpha. Finally, thanks to our new run rate and the investment we are making. We have great confidence in meeting our \u201825 and \u201826 ambition. Thank you everyone. Let\u2019s move to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Antonio Reale, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAntonio Reale : Hi, good morning. It's Antonio from Bank of America. I have two questions, please. The first one on the NII outlook, and secondly on the strategic investment in Commerzbank. So you've increased revenue guidance for this year and I suspect this was mainly driven by NII, though I haven't seen reference to guidance on NII this year or next. Now, Russia's been growing still. Deposit remuneration has been stable. Italy and Germany have had a strong quarter and you still have tailwinds from the replicating portfolio. Can you maybe just talk us through your expectations for NII into 2025, please? That's my first question. The second question is on the investment. You've bought a stake that gives you optionality. I think you've said that clearly. This may or may not lead to a deal. I think in your remarks this morning to the media, you've also talked about this being a long process and you've cautioned it will take time and you want to convince Commerzbank stakeholders that M&A can create value, sort of implying that not all of the stakeholders are on the same page. Now, we're talking about an intra-market deal and I think it's important not just for UniCredit and Commerzbank, but for Europe as a whole in terms of signaling. So my question for you is, what hurdles do you think we still need to overcome for this to move forward, given that I suspect by now you've engaged with all the key stakeholders? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: Okay, so let me take NII first. So we expect a moderate reduction of NII next year and this should be partially offset by fees, but we confirmed that next year bottom line will not budge or beat this year. So there are a number of other dynamics in the P&L that will allow us to do that. With respect to Commerzbank, this started as an investment and is an investment today and nothing else. So we are the largest investor in Commerzbank today, and as such, we are positive and excited that Commerzbank is now setting a course to improve its performance. With respect to anything else, like in any of the situation, there will need to be a discussion with all the stakeholders at Commerzbank or around Commerzbank before we move any further. If you look at the timeline, the timeline is by definition longer than many people have been considering, but has a limit at some point, given that we cannot be invested forever without taking a decision of in or out. But I would not look at that decision being taken before a year from now.\nAntonio Reale : Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Delphine Lee, JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nDelphine Lee: Yes, thank you for taking my questions. So I've got two as well. First of all, just to come back again, sorry, on Commerz, would you ever consider going hostile? And do you see the German Trade Union at Commerzbank as a hurdle to delivering cost synergies? And what concessions do you think you have to offer to get them onboard? And then, sorry, just to clarify on the NII, like also could just mention on the modest reduction, what rate assumptions do you make for next year? And if we're looking at 2% average ECB rates for next year, can you provide just like where you think the offset is on the sensitivity rates? What else can you highlight to help us understand why that resilience on NII? Thank you very much.\nAndrea Orcel: Okay, Delphine, I'll take Commerzbank and then Stefan will take on the NII. So on Commerzbank, I think the definition of hostility is a matter of exactly that definition. So I think there are a number of stakeholders that are critical to the success of the transaction. First and foremost, the employee representatives in Germany, but also German institution, German clients, German public opinion. So it takes time for the facts to sink and for all of these constituencies to being able to discuss openly what a transaction would mean. And therefore, it's very premature to discuss anything about that. There isn't anything on the table at the moment. There never was. At the moment, what there is, is an investor that has bought 21% and is very keen that that investment yields positively to us. But the process of engaging with all the key stakeholders will take some time. At the end of that period or that time, we will assess where we are and as a function of that, we will take a decision as to whether we will do something more or stay as we are or sell out.\nStefano Porro: So Delphine, net interest income. So 24% will be more or less in line with 2023. Average Euribor for the year is 3.6% under our assumption. In relation to the Euribor assumption for next year, so we are expecting, first of all, the deposit facility rate, let's say around 3% this year, so end of \u201824, going around 2% at the end of 2025. All-in-all, we are expecting that the average Euribor next year will be below 2.5%. You can assume, on average between 2.2% and 2.3%. In relation to the commercial trend, we are expecting all-in-all a stability of volumes, both on loans and deposit side, with a slight increase in the credit spread. So we have already experienced during this quarter an increase in the credit spread. We are also expecting a slight increase in the credit spread next year. Just a reminder, one basis point increase in the credit spread for us is around EUR 40 million more net interest income. In relation to Russia, due to the compression, but also different assumption in relation to rates, we are expecting a few hundred million less of contribution from Russia next year.\nDelphine Lee: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Ignacio Cerezo, UBS. Please go ahead.\nIgnacio Cerezo : Yeah. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I've got two. First one is on Germany. I think we've seen like a 20% increase on the NPR number this quarter, but it doesn't seem to be any impact on provisions. So just understanding basically why that is and how concerned actually might you be about German asset quality continuing to deteriorate. And the second one, actually, if you can give us a little bit more information about the impact on capital this quarter from the different transactions and how much pending impact are you expecting from each of them in Q4. Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: So Germany, first of all, important to take into consideration that German asset quality and also default rate this quarter has been impacted by a big ticket. We experienced in the nine months the impact arriving from a couple of big tickets. The overall cost of risk of Germany in the quarter was around 16 basis points. When we look to the default rate, the default rate was above one, including this effect of this ticket. So it was around 1.4. But indeed, if you are taking into consideration the default rate here to-date, adjusted for these big tickets, that's a large corporate, the default rate is below one. So it's 0.7. So in a way, is in line with the same trend of last year. So this is confirming that overall the performance of the portfolio is not deteriorating. So we're not seeing such a deterioration. Like, let's say in other countries, we do have overlays in Germany as well. The overall stock overlays is remaining flat at the end of this quarter to around EUR 1.7 billion. In relation to the impact that they are having from strategic transactions, so I will start from this quarter. So in this quarter, we had around 26 basis points in terms of impact that are coming from strategic transactions. Slightly more than 10 basis points is connected with Commerzbank. Around 15 basis points is connected to the commitment that we have to purchase Aion/Vodeno, Allianz Life in Italy, and Alpha in Romania. We will have further impacts deriving from this acquisition in Q4 and during the course of 2025. In Q4, such an impact can arrive up to 30 basis points, deriving fundamentally from the finalization of Alpha in Romania and from Aion/Vodeno. Aion/Vodeno can also cross the year, but currently we're assuming to have the impact by year end. Next year we will have the finalization of the internalization of the insurance. We will have until the full application of the Danish compromise, a further impact for around 20 basis points. That will be completely offset by the application of the Danish compromise.\nIgnacio Cerezo : Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Hallam, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChris Hallam : Yes, good morning, everybody. So two quick questions for me. So the first one, more broadly, if we were to see tariffs imposed on European exports, how would that impact the outlook for your corporate clients, both in terms of credit costs, but also loan demand? And then second, on asset productivity, how would you expect to \u2013 the revenue to RWA picture to evolve in Italy over the next 12 months? Clearly, the progress there has been very strong. But as you start to absorb the impact of falling rates and there's some other levers you can pull to limit the decline in asset productivity, and perhaps how do you think that picture or the picture on that topic more broadly compares to your peers in Italy who may be a bit more focused on revenues versus asset productivity itself? Thank you.\nStefano Porro : So, I will start from the second. So in relation to the impacts from rates that are having -- the effect on profitability, for sure there will be an impact. But let's consider the impact they're having from the strategy. So, the strategy is assuming a further increase in fees for the group, but for Italy as well, coped with a lending that is a profitable lending. So, we have commented more than once the net interest income return on capital. So, we will have an impact in Italy deriving from the Euribor reduction. All in all, this will impact the net interest income. However, we're expecting to have a revenue to risk weighted asset average above 9% also from 2025 onwards. In relation to the lending trends and also the expectation of the lending trend for the future, let's start from this quarter. So this quarter, the average loan stock was down around 3 billion. More specifically, a part of that was Russia. So 700 of that was Russia. We grew more than one in Eastern Europe, and we had a reduction in Germany and in Italy. The reduction is mainly on the corporate side, and the phenomenon is also different in comparison to what we experienced in the first part of the year. The expectation is connected to the level of the rates and the GDP, in the sense that on the level of the rates, we have already commented before, that's positive for the lending. The GDP in the Western Europe countries, we believe, will be around one. So, all in all, we are expecting a stability in the stock of lending with demand growing up, especially on the short term and progressively during 2025 or some of the medium term. We will grow in Central and Eastern Europe, where we are expecting more stability in terms of dynamic of the stock in Italy and Germany. The improvement in the demand for credit, we will believe it will be progressive. So it will not be sharp immediately after the reduction of the rates, but it will be progressive during the course of 2025.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrea Filtri, Mediobanca. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Filtri : Thank you. We noticed a very strong NII in Germany this quarter. I just wondered if there are any non-recurring items that you can flag to us. Secondly, could you tell us when do you envisage to obtain full FICO status? And what do you think about the option of the Danish Compromise Square, i.e. leaving goods with deduction at the insurance unit when acquiring companies about book value via the insurance unit? Finally, just like a clarification, my line was disturbed. When you said before about timing on a decision on Commerzbank, was it within one year or not before one year? Thank you.\nStefano Porro : So we start from Germany net interest income in the quarter. So first of all, there was a positive effect around EUR 40 million, just slightly less than that. That was positive for Germany, negative for the Group Corporate Centre because we started transferring a part of the trading-related activity from Germany to the parent company. So this is around EUR 40 million. Then there is close to EUR10 million effect deriving from some write-backs on non-performing loans that positively impacted the quarter. However, I have to say that there was also a positive trend from the commercial perspective, especially when we are looking to the pricing. So if we look at the average credit spread of the loan book in Germany, there was an increase of around 3 basis points quarter-on-quarter that, as a consequence, positively impacted the net interest income.\nAndrea Orcel: With respect to Danish Compromise, I think I was wrong once and you were right, Andrea, in the past. But I will give you my opinion on the Danish Compromise squared. I think that the Danish Compromise is, let's say, an arbitrage, and I do think that if it is abused too much, it is going to be reviewed. So, my view is that there are some things where we could all argue that the RWE density is excessive, etc. This is one where we have an advantage and it all balances. But if it becomes too much, I think we can see repercussions. That would be my view of it. So we are internalizing insurance, these bank insurance activities, they have a certain dynamic, and within the broader risk profile of a group, it works. I think if that starts becoming excessive, we may have regulators taking a different position on it, but this is just a perception for me. With respect to Germany, definitely within one year.\nAndrea Filtri: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Marco Nicolai, Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nMarco Nicolai : Hi, good morning. First question on capital distribution. In case you decide to go for a full acquisition of commerce, do you think you will be always able to maintain the above EUR 8.6 billion distribution guidance also in the year of the integration or not? And related to this, do you think that the combined bank requires lower, higher common equity or one target compared to the 12.5%, 13% you referred before? And the question on commission income. So year-on-year growth remains pretty strong, close to 9%. So, how do you see this trending in the coming quarters and in the coming years? And also this quarter, you had quite a bit of support from client hedging fees. And how recurring is this type of income? Thank you.\nStefano Porro : Okay, so I will start from fees. So effectively in the quarter, we had double-digit growth in many fee categories. So, including the client hedging one. So on the investment side, on financing and advisory side, and also the client hedging fee. All in all, in the client hedging fee, I have to say that apart from some volatility deriving from some specific moment or some quarters, all in all, we're able to generate a pretty, let's say, resilient stock of fees over time. In relation to the dynamic in future, we are expecting that apart from the volatility deriving from the market and the rebalancing of the portfolio by the clients, that will affect the investment fees. If you look at the investment fees and the gross sales, this year on average, we have done by quarter around EUR 13 billion of gross sales in every quarter, right? So quarter one, quarter two, quarter three. I don't believe that we can have a repetition of that, let's say, every year. Having said that, the stock of the asset under management will grow, and so the asset under management fee will grow up. In relation to the other component, we are expecting a contribution from advisory financing also during the course of 2025 and 2026. And the client hedging fees, as I told you, apart from general effect deriving from volatility, we believe that thanks to increasing the perimeter coverage of the clients, we can also assume a growth rate in 2025 in relation to the specific items. Having said that, we believe that there are items like non-life insurance and payments that can generate an higher growth in comparison to client hedging fee.\nAndrea Orcel: Let me take the other two. So capital, a few things. One, my conviction is that you don't make profitability and distribution by leveraging your capital. So you will always have us as on the conservative end of the capital in terms of CET1. Then two considerations, however. The first consideration is Balfour. The most of our Balfour impact is operational risk. But if you think about it, we have the same operational risk today that we will have next year and the years after that. The operational risk today is evaluated through advanced models and through a historic series that put it quite low. It is, if I may, artificial, but it gets boosted so much in a standardized way, and it doesn't differentiate between institutions. So like-for-like, my 12.5, 13 should be 60, 70 basis points lower. We're not doing that, but just for you to understand how we think about it. With respect to a larger acquisition, again, we would not leverage ourselves to do an acquisition. Over time, we need to look at what is the right capital for the business. And we note that some competitors are at 12 or just at 12. Some others are 12.5. We have not had to address that issue because we've been so much higher than where we were targeting. But, I think these are all considerations. But the pressure of, we need to get to certain profitability or we need to get to certain distribution, therefore we take capital down and we leverage is not going to be one that we do. On distributions, first of all, there is no deal on the table. Second of all, quite difficult to have a crystal ball of what the deal could be. I would go with principles which usually are more binding than the numbers. We're very committed to rewarding our shareholders. We understand that the level of distribution is a key driver. And whatever we do should be viewed in a way that within a realistic period of time, our distribution on a per share basis go up, not down. Because otherwise, as we all went through school in finance, why would we do that if the cash flows or the dividends declined? Okay, it would be a destruction of value. So, we're very committed to giving a best in class distribution to our shareholders. But best in class distribution was mostly share buyback in the first three years of activity because we viewed so much on express value in our shares that, in my opinion, it was a no brainer. As we move up and the rate of growth is less, we have gradually tilted towards cash dividends because it is probably better reflective of a sustainable growth path that we want to have going forward. And that concept will remain. Now, to answer your question more directly, we will do everything we can do to not dilute well. Firstly, we do that acquisition, our dividend payout does not move. It's 50%, it stays 50%. Secondly, we will do everything we can to maintain the dividend per share to at least equal to what we have before the acquisition. That does not mean we will succeed in year one, but we're very, very confident we can do that or better in year two and beyond. Thirdly, with respect to the share buyback, I'll give you an alternative interpretation. Until today, we've done share buybacks. Why? We've done share buybacks to reduce the share count at an attractive rate and propel furthers the EPS and the DPS going forward. Right. So we've done that to inject more growth into our EPS and our DPS. But there is an alternative view of things. I could keep the share count stable and increase further my EPS and DPS by having more earnings and more dividends. An acquisition is the use of my excess capital, and to a certain extent, it could also be the use of some of my share buyback at the initial point to buy more earnings, which generates more dividend and therefore propel my EPS and DPS. So it's just an alternative view of things. When we stabilize, let's take it like that. And I tell people that if they talk to me about five years or whatever, I'm not listening. For me, stabilize is year two onward. The first year is always a little bit like that. When we stabilize, our philosophy of distributions should not move a lot, which means we will have distribution that are a high percentage of a net income generated. In which mix? Well, we will see what is best for our shareholders. Is it 50% cash dividend and 50% share buyback? Is it 60% cash dividend and 40% share buyback? I cannot say. Today, it's too much speculation. But I think if you look at the principle I know and the management team and the board know full well that we have a distribution policy. It needs to be defended, and if we find a way to strengthen the bank, grow the bank, and improve the distribution policy a little bit later by taking maybe a little bit of uncertainty in the year one, that is something we can do. If it takes more than that, this touches on our strict criteria of investment. And we will not do that. And I hope that that answers your question.\nMarco Nicolai : That's very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Azzurra Guelfi, Citi. Please go ahead.\nAzzurra Guelfi : Hi. Good morning. One quick question on your organic capital generation. You continue quarter after quarter to surprise us on the strength of this, which is linked to profitability but also to the capital efficiency measure. I read a comment about the support by organic capital generation, the best-in-class distribution for the ambition for 2025 and 2026. Can you give us a little bit of color on what the organic capital generation could look like, also in light of the fact that maybe there could be some lending growth?\nAndrea Orcel: So I will give you a broad picture. And I'm sure Stefano will add. So, organic capital generation, the organic capital generation comes from two sources. One is, let's call it commercial or current. And that is the earnings quality. If I go for volume in NII, I will not have a lot of capital generation. If I have more fee-to-revenue, I will have a lot of capital generation. So, what we have done in these last four years is to improve the profitability of NII to prepare for a time when, due to rates decline and cost of risk increase, NII will be contributing less to our profitability, because obviously we will be making a lower margin in general. And we have also done that by continuously increasing our fees, because fees have a one-to-one capital generation. That's the commercial one. The commercial one will slightly tilt in the future. On the one hand, you're going to have the exact mirror image of what you've had in the last four years. In these last four years, most European banks have had declining volume, increasing margin. That is paradise for capital generation. As rates go down, you're going to have increasing volume and decreasing margin. This is how it goes exactly in the opposite direction, i.e., in order to maintain, you need to do more volume, to do more volume, you're consuming more capital. Where we come from, we're declining, so we consume less capital, but the margin is carrying the revenue to RWAs. Every bank will have pressure on revenue to RWAs going forward. We think that that pressure we can minimize by the mix of client and product. So, moving the mix of product towards consumer, away from mortgages, allows us to have more insulation in the margin, which allows us to be less hit by a compression of margins that would happen later. So, we've worked on that on one side. On the fees, obviously, the more fees you have as a total of revenue, those are capital neutral, and those generate one-to-one. So, this is the commercial and how you do it. So, if you look at the commercial for the next three years, the overall revenue, making EUR 1 of revenue or EUR 1 revenue, it will generate less capital organically than what it has generated in the past three years. That's true from everybody. Our job is to minimize that less. Then there is another driver. The other driver that we had was that in 2021, we had a very inefficient portfolio of lending and usage of capital. And over the last four years, we have made it more and more and more and more efficient. So now, I would say that most of our lending book is adjusted for risk above the cost of equity. I would say probably 70%, 75% of it. Can we take it to 80%, 85%? Yes. Can we take it to 100%? No. It's never the case because you will have decision on, I'll do this loan to this client. It's below my cost of equity, but I'll give him three years to mature because I want the growth, et cetera. So, the advantage we have been crystallizing through that is going to run to zero. When will it run to zero? Well, it depends, but we think that by the end of 2025, we're probably done with that. So, that extra boost that has allowed us to do something that seems to defy gravity, i.e. generate more capital than our net income, is going to converge down from \u201826 onward. However, because there is always a however, Stefano will also give you a view on infamous DTAs, which are going to be capital positive from sometime in 26 for the next two or three years. And so, the relay from the portfolio, from the old portfolio, will be taken by the crystallization of the value on capital of the DTAs. And this is a good point to pass it to Stefano.\nStefano Porro : So, some data points. \u201824, the organic capital generation is around 400 basis points adjusted for extraordinary transactions. So, not taking into consideration extraordinary transactions. After this, more than 300 is the profit, and then the balance is a risk-weighted asset. When we look to 2025, as we have already highlighted, both for 2025 and 2026, we are guiding for a profit. So, our ambition is to have a profit of above nine. So, we have an organic capital generation from the profit above 300 basis points. As highlighted by Andrea, during the course of 2025, we are expecting to be able to generate further capital via the management of the risk-weighted asset of the portfolio. This should be able to compensate some model changes effect and the potential growth that are in front of the business, so from the lending. In relation to the model changes, we are expecting to have a few billions that are in front of the model changes in terms of the risk-weighted asset increase in Q4, and a few billions also during the course of 2025. Having said that, this amount, as highlighted, will be offset by the active portfolio management action that we will put in place. From 2026 onwards, we are in a way a target, i.e. something more than 300 basis points of capital generated by the profit, and active portfolio management action that should be, to a lower extent, able to fund the growth of the lending, but the difference is not meaningful in terms of basis points difference. With regards to DTAs, where the benefit to the capital from DTAs is coming from? It's coming from utilization of tax loss carry forward. Currently, we have recognized in our balance sheet around 3.4 billion of assets that are related to tax loss carry forward. When we are going to utilize these assets, we are going to have not anymore in the balance sheet an asset that is deducted from the capital. All in all, the contribution to the common equity Tier 1 starting from next year can be between 15 and 20 basis points of contribution to the common equity Tier 1 ratio, positive per year. Again, the reason is source is, utilization of the tax loss carry forward DTAs that we have is fundamental in Italy. Positive effect is between 15 and 20 basis points per year starting from 2025 onwards.\nOperator: The last question is from Hugo Cruz, KBW. Please go ahead.\nHugo Cruz : Hi, thank you for the time. Just two questions. First of all, on Commerz, can you give us a deadline for you to make a decision on the financial instruments that would raise your stake to 21%? How long can you wait? And I think you said that you will wait for the Commerz Investor Day. I'm not sure if I'm correct. And second, on cost of risk, can you remind us of your guidance for the guidance for 2025 and if it assumes any overlay usage? Thank you.\nAndrea Orcel: So let me start with Commerzbank. So I think let's not confuse two different things. The first one is we have asked the ECB for authorization to move our participation in Commerzbank from 9.5% to up to a maximum of 29.9%, which is the level before you need to launch a bid. We would not be able to move or to convert what you call financial instruments into physical shares or into having the physical shares under our control until we have ECB approval. ECB approval takes 60 days, but the 60 days gets stopped every time there is a new question or there is a new doubt or whatever, and we need to give them back. So, they're not 60 days, they're actually longer. If you tell me when the process will be finished, I will tell you when we move on the financial instrument. I don't know. I don't think at this point in time it makes much of a difference, because at some point within the time that interests us, we will have \u201ccontrol of the shares and everything else\u201d. The second thing that is important is that this is a process that we started to have maximum flexibility. But if there were a process for an acquisition, that follows a completely different process. So, fundamentally, this current ECB approval is not relevant for a full bid on Commerzbank. If we were to do that, that will follow a completely different process, which may go in parallel after, before the 29.9% approval. So the two are not on the critical path of each other. Then I just said, with respect to Investor Day, that given that we believe that the two banks are the mirror image of each other, and we're pretty convinced of what can be done, we are quite interested as a shareholder that has a lot of money on the plate to see what the Investor Day will deliver on bridging some, all, or more than all of the gap that Commerzbank has with HVB in Germany. The second question, the second question, cost of risk and overlays. So, firstly, on cost of risk, we have said that we are confident we can maintain a cost of risk of 20 to 25 basis points through the cycle. Clearly, at the moment, we're running a lot lower. In keeping the cost of risk at 20 to 25 basis point through the cycle, we said that there could be two scenarios to simplify. Scenario A, we have all, particularly I, been too nervous about the credit cycle in Europe, and it's relatively benign. If it is relatively benign, we will be able to keep the cost of risk of our group to 20% to 25%, either not touching or touching the overlays to a minimum level or to a limited level. In this case, we would still need to release them because the overlays are tied, very strictly tied to specific event and to specific situations. And therefore, you would have a profitability of the bank that is actually propelled by the release of the lion's share of the overlays. In the other scenario, which is the other extreme, that the credit cycle is, as we all think, going to be a little bit more daunting. If that is the case, we will cover the 20 to 25 basis points of cost of risk for the cycle through normal LLPs through the years. And the excess, the 20% to 25%, would be insured by releasing the overlays on those situations that we have already identified. So, really, you have really two situations. Above and beyond the fact that we believe that the quality of our loan portfolio is quite good and we've really scrubbed it a and that our ordinary provisions on the conservative side, so we are confident. If the credit cycle is very negative, then we have the overlays to keep it at 20% to 25%. If it's relatively mild, then the overlays still need to be released. But instead of going to cover the excess provision, they will go directly to the bottom line to propel our net income. This is why, when we talked about idiosyncratic accelerator, we use line of defense as one of them, because the overlays will either ensure that our cost of risk is below most of our peers, other peers, or if that's not necessary, propel directly the bottom line by being released. I hope I make sense.\nHugo Cruz : Very clear, thank you.\nOperator: So that was the last question. I turn the conference back to the management for any closing remarks.\nAndrea Orcel : So thank you very much, everybody, for your time. And we'll see you at the next quarterly result. Thank you.",

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Good morning. And thank you for joining us today as we present another record set of results, ushering UniCredit in a new era of sustainable quality growth. I apologize in advance for my voice, but I'm a little bit under the weather. Over the last four years, UniCredit has undergone a successful transformation, achieving 15 consecutive quarters of quality growth and improvement, outperforming peers across all KPIs, and poised to establish a new sustainable run rate in 2024, a base from which we intend to grow. Our record-breaking results in Q3 and over the past nine months are further testaments to our success driven by the contribution of our people. Sustainable quality growth for us means a growing bottom line that does not sacrifice a top line of exceptional quality driven by profitable NII and growing rate of fees, combined with operational and capital excellence. This delivers best-in-class profitability and organic capital generation, enabling us to return outsized distribution to our stakeholders. This is the benchmark we intend to set. Our transformation has ushered us into a new era where the work we have undertaken to strengthen our business will become even more apparent, and the full extent of our transformation will finally be for everyone to see. With our structural strengths fuelled by unique accelerators and a clear quality growth trajectory, we are well prepared to navigate a challenging macro environment. We are excited about the future and look forward to continuing to deliver exceptional results for all our stakeholders, as confirmed by our upgraded 2024 guidance and future ambition. UniCredit Unlocked has proven to be a winning, flexible strategy built to adapt to a changing environment. Anchored by our vision of becoming the bank for Europe's future, it delivers consistent value to all stakeholders, setting a new benchmark in banking. Our strategy is entirely client-centric. We empower our people in a streamlined organization. We offer best-in-class products, both in-house and through partners, benefiting from group-wide scale. We leverage reliable digital and data capabilities to enhance the client experience, all to serve our clients where and when they need us, across a fully integrated channel. All this is underpinned by a culture of empowerment, accountability and continuous improvement. Over 15 consecutive quarters, this strategy and the dedication of our people allowed us to achieve sector leadership across key metrics. We lead in net revenue to RWA, cost-income ratio and return on tangible equity at 13% CET1. Our EPS growth and total distributions are also best-in-class. We are operating on a completely new run rate versus 2021. Our net profit is 5x higher, our return on tangible, 3x higher, our organic capital generation, 2x higher, and so are our distributions. This quarter, we again achieved impressive results, driven by our focus on profitable NII, increased fees and improved operational and capital efficiency. All this leads to superior return on tangible equity and organic capital generation to support best-in-class distributions. Given the backdrop of rates and path-through normalization, the profitable growth in NII of 3% in the nine months and almost flat performance sequentially quarter-on-quarter is particularly impressive. This performance is a direct result of our diversified geographic mix, a continued shift to higher risk-adjusted profitability clients and products, and our strict discipline on deposit path-through. Overall cost of risk remain well below our target at 9 basis points for nine months, thanks to continued significant write-backs, again underscoring the conservativeness of our provisioning policy. As such, net NII dynamics mirror gross NII. Our fee income grew 7.2% in the nine months and an impressive 8.5% in the quarter year-on-year, with fees-to-revenue reaching 33% and 32%, respectively, thanks to our investment in the business and the focus of our people on our clients. Our focus on operational efficiency while investing and capital efficiency while targeting profitable growth continue to set the benchmark for the industry. Absolute cost declined by 1.2% over nine months and 1.4% in the quarter year-on-year, with our cost-to-income ratio at industry-leading level of 36.6%, 2.5 percentage points better than a year ago. Our net revenue to RWAs reached 8.9% of circa 1 percentage point from a year ago. RWAs were reduced to EUR 278 billion. It is this combined performance across multiple levers that allowed us to reach a record return on tangible equity at 13% CET1of circa 23.3%, about 20% reported, for both the nine months and the quarter. A record organic capital generation of EUR 10.1 billion or 357 basis points for the nine months while increasing our CET1 ratio to 16.4% per investment. Net profit growth of 16% in the nine months and 8% in the quarter. In the nine months, our EPS increased by 31%, accrued DPS by 48% and tangible book per share by 20%. Let's now look at the P&L in detail. Net revenue increased 5.4% to EUR 18.6 billion in the nine months and 2.6% to EUR 6 billion in the quarter. This is a result of; one, resilient NII despite lower rates and best-in-class NII RoAC at circa 19% in the quarter, well above the cost of equity. Two, top-tier fee to revenue, which continues to gain momentum. Three, LLPs, still a low point and stable, still benefiting from right-back, confirming quality origination and conservative provisioning. Four, trading and others continues to be solid despite the impact from the Commerzbank investment. Despite the reduction in rates, we have successfully maintained a stable NII both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. This achievement is testament to our effective deposit path-through management, resulting in path-through rate of 32% in the third quarter and growth strategies in selected areas. Our focus on quality has led to constrained overall volume growth, but it has also resulted in our NII RoAC reaching approximately 19%, well above our cost of equity. This has put us in a position of strength as we weather the impact of rates normalization. This approach has been crucial in maintaining our financial stability and ensuring our continued success. Our cost of risk remained low at nine basis points for the first nine months, in line with the same period last year. This achievement is largely due to significant right-backs in Russia and elsewhere. This will eventually abate, bringing our cost of risk closer in line with our expectation. Our performing portfolio is highly covered and is of high quality. Our gross non-performing exposure stock and net NPE stock remain stable at 2.7% and 1.4% respectively. This stability reflects our discipline approach to managing non-performing exposures and maintaining a healthy balance sheet. Our fees have experienced a significant increase across all main categories, growing by 7% over the first nine months of the year and 8.7% excluding the current account and securitization cost and 8.5% year-over-year. Our fee-to-revenue ratio stands at a top tier 33%, highlighting the quality and diversification of our fee base. We continue to see strong momentum in assets under management and non-life insurance, driven by increased client appetite and a broader product offering. Payments and current account performance is driven by payment, up 6% over nine months while down 3% in the quarter due to a change in contractual incentive features in Italy. We expect to catch up by year end. Our advisory and financing services have also seen strong acceleration reflecting the benefit of our past investments and a supportive environment. We believe we are the only bank that has consistently reduced our absolute cost base during the last two years of setting inflation across our footprint while increasing revenues and investing in the business quarter-over-quarter. This quarter and nine months are no exception. We've cost down respectively 1.4% and 1.2% year-over-year. Our cost-to-income ratio has improved to 36.6%. We lead in our peer group. This achievement is a result of strong discipline combined with a targeted approach to streamlining our organization and reducing unnecessary overhead. Our operational excellence has been a key factor in our success and we intend to defend it. Our best-in-class organic capital generation of EUR10.1 billion in the nine months and EUR 3.5 billion in the quarter has allowed us to accrue 100% of net profit for distribution while increasing CET1 to 16.4% pre-investment versus 15.9% in full year 2023. This quarter, we have also absorbed the initial capital impact of various strategic investments that will propel our results in the future. These include building a stake in Commerzbank, committing towards our insurance internalization, acquisition of Aion/Vodeno and of Alpha Bank in Romania. Some further capital consumption is expected from these stakes in the future. Group RWA increased slightly as almost EUR 5 billion of reduction was more than offset by the impact of strategic investments. We expect RWA to increase by a few billion next quarter. Looking to Basel IV, the full year impact is expected at around 70 basis points as we implement mitigation action on credit risk while the initial impact in Q1\u201925 will be around 90 basis points. As we look at our region and product factories, I would like to remind you that UniCredit is more than the sum of its part. Our achievements stem from a collective effort across regions and factories, each contributing to our overall strengths, but all coming together as one group that is worth far more than the sum of its part. Italy. Italy continued to deliver high profitability and growth underpinned by earnings quality and operational and capital excellence. Net revenues were up 5% in the nine months, reaching EUR 8.2 billion with a quarter up 3%. NII was up 5% in the nine months and remarkably 1% in the quarter with rates reduction more than compensated by the continued improvement in the mix of our business and strong management of the pass-through. Cost of risk remained mild at 28 basis points for the nine months and the quarter, showing continued stability. Fees were up 7% in the nine months and 9% in the quarter with all product contributing and particular strengths in investments, non-life insurance where we continue to grow our market share and advisory capital market. Operational excellence was maintained. Costs were broadly flat in spite of the salary contract renewal, inflation and investment in growth within the business. Cost income ratio was reduced yet again to 34% in the nine months. Our focus on capital efficiency further increased our net revenue to RWAs by 1.4 percentage point to 10.5%. Profit before tax rose 17% in the nine months to reach EUR 5 billion, up 19% in the quarter. RoAC reached 33% in the nine months. The region generated EUR 4.4 billion or 156 basis points of capital organically, confirming it as a quality earnings powerhouse. Our client and community remained at the heart of our operation as we rolled out the third iteration of UniCredit per l\u2019Italia to support individuals and SMEs in navigating the continued challenging external environment. With the recent flooding in the [inaudible] region, UniCredit provided a program of financial support and flex for individual, small businesses as well as providing financial and practical help for people. The full benefit of the investment in UniCredit University became more apparent this year, increasing its access to training and up-skilling for our people. The University also played a critical part on the landmark agreement with the Italian unions which saw 600 employees moving into a bespoke risk-killing and re-deployment program. Germany. Germany remains an anchor country for UniCredit and has once again surpassed expectations delivering its best nine months and third quarter profit in over a decade. These results are thanks to continued discipline in improving the quality and profitability of our top line and the increased efficiency of our operations. These factors underscore the strengths of this franchise, both within its home country and as a core contributor to UniCredit. Net revenue was slightly down 1% in the nine months, as strong fees only partially compensated for a slight higher cost of risk. The quarter was up 6%. NII was down 5% in the nine months, driven by higher funding costs in client risk management. The quarter was up 7% as this trend started reversing. Cost of risk was marginally up in the nine months to 19 basis points, driven by two large corporate default in Q1 and Q2, mitigated by a prudent coverage ratio. Q3 was back to trend line at 16 basis points. Fees were up 2% in the nine months, accelerating to 7% year-on-year, driven by investment, financing, and payments of a strong base. Operational efficiency continued to improve, with costs down 7% in the nine months and 9% in the quarter. This led to a cost income ratio of 39.4% in the nine months. Our capital efficiency improved further, with net revenue over RWA increasing 0.8 percentage point to 8% in the nine months. Profit before tax rose 17.5% in the nine months to EUR 2.3 billion, and up 17% on a year-on-year basis, RoAC reached 22%. Germany generated EUR 2.3 billion, or 82 basis points of capital organically, in the nine months. Germany continued to deliver on its commitment to invest in its business, with a particular focus on the network. Training and up-skilling was rolled out for 1,300 employees, enabling us to retain our talent, providing the opportunity for our people to broaden their skill set and adapt to new roles in our private and corporate banking divisions. Germany was this year named top employer in Germany, and was instrumental in UniCredit being the first bank in Europe to achieve a Global Edge Certificate. It picked up seven Euromoney Awards for its performance across all of its key markets. Central Europe continues to be a dynamic region, delivering resilient growth and continuing to improve operational and capital excellence. Net revenue were up 3% in the nine months, reaching EUR 3.3 billion, driven by strong fees and resilient NII, while slightly down in the quarter due to lower rates and higher deposit path through. NII was up 1% in the nine months, remaining resilient amidst the declining rates environment. The quarter was down 8.5% year-on-year due to lower rates, higher deposit path through, particularly in Austria and Hungary, and a time delay in repricing savings accounts in Austria that shall be reversed at a later date. Cost of risk had net reversal of four basis points in the nine months due to write-backs in Q1 and Q2, while at zero basis points for the quarter. Fees were up an impressive 10% in the nine months, thanks to strong investment services and a large advisory mandate in check in Q2. Excluding such mandate, fees were up 8%. As with evolve our markets, the striving for operational excellence continued, with costs slightly decreasing in the quarter and growing by only 1% in the nine months. Cost-income ratio reduced yet again by 1% to 36.5% in the nine months, reaching 36.6% in the quarter. Our focus on capital efficiency led to an increase in our net revenue to RWA of 0.3% to 7.4%. Pre-tax profit rose 9% in the nine months to in excess of EUR 1.9 billion, resulting in a RoAC of 24%. The region generated a record EUR 1.7 billion or 61 basis points of capital organically in the nine months. As the core gross engine of the group, within our surging markets, Eastern Europe delivered again across all revenue streams. Net revenues were up 14%, reaching EUR 2.2 billion in the nine months, with flat performance in the quarter due to LLP normalization. NII was up 11% in the nine months, driven by strong commercial growth with a quarter plus 2% year-over-year, with strong business growth across the region and good path-through control compensating for rate reductions. Cost of risk had net reversal of 34 basis points in the nine months due to Q1 and Q2 write backs. Q3 cost of risk moved towards trend line at 12 basis points, as most of our write backs reduced. Fees were up 10% in the nine months, with a quarter up 5% year-over-year, driven by a positive momentum across all categories and supported mainly by client hedging fees and payments. As with all our markets, operational excellence remained a focus, balanced with investment in our business, people and technology. These commitments saw costs increase just 3.5% in the nine months and in the quarter, offsetting most of the region's high inflation due to wage drift. Cost-income ratio reduced yet again to 30.3% in the nine months, and our focus on capital efficiency further increased our net revenue to RWA by 0.3 percentage points to 9.8%. Pre-tax profit rose 20% in the nine months to EUR 1.5 billion, with flat performance in the quarter due to LLP's normalization, resulting in a RoAC just below 40%. As with all our markets, our banks across the CEE remain focused on supporting those communities within which they operate, with Austria along with Czech and Slovakia providing emergency aid packages for those sadly impacted by the recent flooding. Our cross-market partnership with Teach For All and Junior Achievement Europe, continue to receive both financial and practical support from the teams on the ground. Internally, our next generation of employees were supported through bespoke peer-to-peer training for junior and digital skill training at all levels, to ensure advanced skills and tools to thrive in a digital era. Our strategy in Russia has been to work towards an orderly solve and wind-down as quickly as possible, always within both the letter and the spirit of complex legal, regulatory and sanction limitation. Last quarter, we communicated our targets for full year 2025. We have already nearly met them. Local deposits are down 27% this quarter and 77% since Q1, 2022, from EUR 8.3 billion to EUR 1.9 billion, already below our 2025 target. Local loans are down 31% this quarter and 78% since Q1 \u201822, from EUR 7.3 billion to EUR 1.6 billion, closing on our below EUR 1 billion target for 2025. Cross-border exposure remained flat this quarter as most of the position will mature next year. Since Q1 2022, we are down 95% from EUR 4.5 billion to EUR 300 million, whilst minimizing our loss to 11% of principal. Cross-border payments are down 19% this quarter and 64% since Q1, 2022, from EUR 25.3 billion to EUR 25.9 billion, almost at our 2025 target. Cross-border payments are now strongly concentrated in U.S. dollar, cleared by JP Morgan, and euro, cleared by us. Our euro payment volumes, which account for under one-third of the total were almost 55% between Western multinationals and socially oriented companies. We have reduced the capital impact of a full write-down of Russia from circa 130 basis points on a 14% CET1 ratio in Q1 2022 to circa 50 basis points on a 16.1% CET1 ratio today. Given the progress made, we will review further next steps regarding Russia, and will communicate them in due course. Turning to our product factories, we see strong performance across the board. Client solution revenue grew by 8% in the nine months to EUR 8.6 billion. Two-thirds are fees, growing at the same pace and well-balanced across all our factories. Corporate solution revenues rose by 7% to EUR 4.1 billion in the nine months, driven by advisory and financing up 6%, 18% excluding securitization costs, and CRM up 11%. Payment solution rose by 4% to EUR 2 billion, driven by payments up 9%. Individual solution rose by 13% to EUR 2.5 billion, driven by investments up 17%. One market grew to EUR 11.6 billion AUM, also supported by the Azimut Partnership in Italy, confirming the attractiveness for clients of our offer. Our transformation has led to remarkable results. We have focused on superior quality top-line growth, coupled with best-in-class operational and capital efficiency, resulting in best-in-class profitability and distribution. By making this our focus, we have registered the highest NII RoAC at 20%, almost double the peer average. Our stated fees and insurance income growth for full year \u201821 to the first half of \u201824 was an impressive 24%, five points higher than the peer average. Additionally, our fees-to-revenue ratio for the same period was 34%, seven points higher than our peers. We have reduced our cost-income ratio to 36%, 15 points below the peer average. We have improved our net revenue-to-RWA ratio to 9%, two points above our peers. Delivering on our three levers has led to superior profitability and distribution. Our return on tangible equity at 13% CET1 ratio was over 23%, 10 points higher than the peer average. Our distribution year at circa 14% is 5 percentage points higher than our peer average. As the industry faces headwinds, UniCredit stands ready to reveal its true differential value, qualities that were previously masked by favorable market environment. We acknowledge the challenges set at NII headwinds, inflationary pressure on cost, cost of risk normalization, compression of Russia, and digital evolution, but we are confident in our ability to leverage our unique levers to overcome them. Differently from four years ago, we start from a leadership position in terms of performance. We know our strengths, our geographic client and product mix that we have been able to unify and leverage as one group. Powering this are several accelerators, the transformational initiatives in flight, our lines of defense, and our strategic flexibility. Finally, we have a quality growth trajectory which is relentlessly executed by people proven to be able to deliver alpha. Our unique geographical reach is one of our structural strengths, providing us with a diversified presence across 13 European markets. We are one federation of individually empowered banks, all executing independently, while leveraging significant cross-border flows. Simplifying, 41% of our net profit comes from Italy, a quality earnings powerhouse that combines a fee-to-revenue ratio in excess of 40%, pro forma for insurance internalization, and increasingly profitable NII with outstanding operational and capital efficiency. The next 30% comes from Germany and Austria, both highly rated economies that act as anchors of resiliency for the group, and that are well advanced in an operational efficiency and greater client-focused turnaround. The final 29% comes from Central and Eastern Europe, our proven engine for profitable growth, all within Europe, which increasingly puts our group's growth expectation at a premium to the peer group. We\u2019ve had the perfect combination of highly capital-generative and resilient regions, balanced with dynamically growing ones, all truly coming together in one group. This allows us to benefit from our global product offering, procurement, and technology infrastructure at scale, further enhancing our competitive edge. This has enabled us to occupy a dominant position across Europe with our individual leading position in each country, all significantly beating their cost of equity and connecting client across Europe like no other. Our client franchise and product mix are core to our quality growth strategy. While we maintain our focus on large corporates and mass market individual, we have been decisively tilting our client mix towards SMEs and private and affluent individual. We have also been building our factories to provide our clients with a broader array of products and services that they require. This strategy has been successful as demonstrated by our gaining market share in payments, in investments, in insurance, in consumer finance, and in trade finance. In parallel, we continue to enhance our distribution model towards a fully integrated distribution of, that combine digital innovation with personalized, human interaction in various forms. This is at the origin of the work we have done on call centers, digital branch with Buddy, physical branch, and internet and mobile. Last but not least, we're investing in our people, some of the best in the industry, retraining them where necessary at the UniCredit University, and providing them with a product, distribution channel and tool such as new risk models and client's data that they need. Whilst we have transformed into an industry leader focusing on delivering quality growth, we still have unique accelerators to propel us further. We're making transformative investment that will drive our progress and ensure we remain at the forefront of our industry. Our lines of defense are strong and ready to protect or propel our continued growth and success. Strategic investment remain a potential accelerator, helping us to achieve our goal faster, more efficiently and effectively. We're committed to making these investments, but always within our strict investment criteria. UniCredit has invested in Commerzbank, because we believe it can be a much better and stronger bank, particularly in and for Germany, better and stronger for its people, for its customer, and for its communities. This is true standalone, where most of the potential improvement lies, and even more so as a combined entity with HVB. As an industrial investor that has successfully overcome the same challenges, our aim is to see Commerzbank unlock its significant unrealized potential. Indeed, as we all know, having potential on paper is not the same as crystallizing it. UniCredit unlocked, and indeed HVB unlocked, is a blueprint of what can be done, but we are open to alternative solution and await these being outlined at Commerzbank Investor Day. As a possible additional option, the combination of Commerzbank and HVB could generate even greater value and opportunities for all employees, clients and communities. But as we said before, this will depend on the outcome of engagement with Commerzbank, its management supervisory board, as well as its wider stakeholders in Germany. A combination could offer Germany a bank operated by a fully empowered German legal entity, but could more effectively compete in its home market and beyond. It will also insert mBank and Poland within the broader UniCredit franchise, both in the CEE and Europe as a whole. mBank would be provided with a capital, product and services, and indeed client connection across our 13 countries, plus one, to accelerate its growth and achieve its full potential. For UniCredit, such a combination would further transform the group and accelerate its path to become the bank for Europe's future, whilst crystallizing significant additional value creation to our base case. Italy, Germany, Austria, and Central and Eastern Europe would have a balanced contribution to the Group and set its direction, strategy and ambition for the future, that they would then be fully empowered to individually achieve. Above and beyond what I just said, I would like to highlight a number of facts with respect to the two banks that support our strongly held views. HVB and Commerzbank, excluding mBank and the opaque assets held at Corporate Centre, are mirror images of each other. They are identical in many ways, but also highly complementary. Our respective geographic presence makes us a perfect match. HVB covers mainly the southern and the northern part of the country, while Commerzbank is mostly present elsewhere in Germany. In Corporate, we're all but the same. We both cover large corporate, as do many other banks, most Europeans through branches or U.S. banks. Whilst the combined institution would have the scale, product and services to better support large corporates in Germany, it is the Mittelstand clients who would benefit most from a combination. We would be able to provide deeper and broader support and services to these companies who are at the heart of so many German communities and are the lifeblood of the economy. Commerzbank Mittelstand clients could gain access to our market-leading suite of products and more comprehensive financing solutions, boosting their opportunity for growth domestically and internationally. Combined with our enhanced technology offering, we have the potential to become a larger, more profitable one-stop shop for the Mittelstand in Germany, across Europe and beyond. On the retail side, Commerzbank revenues are 2.1x HVB's, although HVB has 4x the revenue per retail client, both because of mix and because it can rely on our group product factories. The two banks are complementary geographically and by client segment, with HVB more focused on private wealth and affluent. The larger weight of retail in Commerzbank Germany operation would nicely balance HVB's higher weight of corporate. Having now addressed the point on similarity and complementarity of the two franchises that would support a potential combination with minimal impact on its client and frontline employees, let me now address with facts some of the other concerns that have been raised around this potential combination. Let's start with risk, both a protection of deposit and in terms of financial strengths. Far from being a concern, in the unlikely situation where deposit protection would be needed, HVB deposits are insured by the same German government deposit scheme as Commerzbank. In fact, during the crisis, HVB and UniCredit at group level continued to function without any need for government support, maintaining an orderly service to our clients. In addition, clients of both banks benefited from additional protection of company capital and other resources, which are greater in the case of HVB, both standalone and relying on UniCredit group. Indeed, both HVB and UniCredit have a greater common equity Tier 1 ratio than Commerzbank. Above 23% and 16% respectively, Commerzbank stands at 14.8%. This is further underpinned by a far greater level of profitability and efficiency at both UniCredit Group and HVB versus Commerzbank. This brings us to ratings. At group level, UniCredit has recorded a consistently steady improvement in its ratings, with Fitch only last week raising again the rating of UniCredit to one notch above Italy's on par to Commerzbank. At HVB local legal entity level, the relative comparator to Commerzbank, the two banks are practically on par, as underscored by their similar cost of funding in Germany. Finally, Moody's has already indicated that a merger far from leading to a rating downgrade could warrant a rating increase at the parent company level benefit all banks. And as it relates to concern for stakeholders, we take pride in the investment we make in our employees and the commitment we have made to reskilling and retraining all colleagues to ensure that they can grow and develop in line with our industry. Where efficiency have to be looked at, the challenging yet constructive dialogue that we have with employees' representatives, have resulted in outcomes that have worked well for all those involved. And to our clients, and the notion of overlap, far from being duplication, HVB and Commerzbank are highly complementary, so concentration should not be an issue. This client commitment is reflected in the federal nature of our business, where to be clear, the day-to-day running and decision-making for Germany occurs in Germany, and it could not be otherwise given regulation. This is also consistent with UniCredit Unlocked and our approach to empowerment of those closest to the client, or the matter at hand, as opposed to those at the center. Our shareholders have benefited from 15 quarters of consistent growth and financial rewards, repaying us with their long-term and often vocal support. Any discussion around current investment and future options must be underpinned by facts, rather than unsubstantiated views and opinions, hence the need for this clarification. If we now go back to the symmetry already outlined, all stakeholders should be able to compare relative performance of Commerzbank Germany, ex-corporate center in HVB, and HVB like-for-like, based on simple KPIs, even before discussing the benefit of a potential combination. Let me now go through a comparison of the operating performance of the two banks in Germany, as this is the real crux of the issue. If we take as reference the 2021 first half \u2013 to first half \u201824 period, that saw both UniCredit and Commerzbank deliver on their respective plans, the performance of both banks in Germany speaks for itself. HVB delivered much greater revenue growth, mostly driven by fees, achieved with much greater capital and cost efficiency. This all led to twice the net profit growth and RoAC of Commerzbank, notwithstanding Commerzbank benefiting to a much higher degree from the positive rates environment, given their greater weighting to retail. As such, HVB has been able to distribute its yearly net profit in 2022 and 2023, while increasing its CET1 to circa 24% as of the third quarter of \u201824, while Commerzbank has distributed on average over the same period, only 40% of its net profit, reaching a CET1 of 14.8%. There is no reason why Commerzbank in Germany, should not have the ambition to at least match what has been achieved by HVB, which is still progressing further as the results of today demonstrate. Our investment in Commerzbank is both strategically and financially justified given what I have just taken you through. The potential to generate substantial value for both institutions is there. The question remains whether it shall be unlocked by Commerzbank alone, through a combination or not at all. We have purposely structured our investment to provide us with optionality, to either benefit from the crystallization of Commerzbank potential or to exit with protected downside for our shareholders' benefit. We have clear managerial action that will allow us to offset the headwinds from the normalization of the environment and the compression of Russia, to eventually secure sustainable quality growth. Our aim is to further strengthen the unparalleled quality and profitable mix of our top line, increasing our fee base to 40% of total revenue, while keeping NII RoAC well above our internal cost of equity. To achieve this, we will continue our client and product mix shift, further leverage our product factories and better integrate them with our front lines. The internalization of insurance and retention of the asset management value chain will provide a further boost. We are committed to operational excellence while investing in business optimization. Our replicating strategy, and quality approach, will help us benefit from lower sensitivity to rates. We will maintain a cost of risk at 20 to 25 basis points over the cycle, also leveraging overlays. Our financial projections mean we are confident in upgrading our 2024 guidance. If we compare our performance like-for-like with our guidance at the beginning of 2024, so excluding integration and average charges and investment, we currently expect our net profit to be around EUR 10 billion, with NII more or less flat year-over-year. Like-for-like, this is more than EUR 500 million higher than 2023. That said, we anticipate closing the year with a net profit above EUR 9 billion. Although the ultimate number depends on our decision on integration and average charges, integration charges are expected to exceed EUR 500 million. There is much discussion as to the impact on the bottom line of European banking sector due to the much lower rate environment and higher cost of risk. For us, there is also the compression from Russia to be considered. As a result of our unique levers, fee and geographical diversification, and the decisive action taken over the recent year, we are confident that we will maintain a run rate of at least EUR 9 billion in each of \u201825 and \u201826. For now, that is a strong ambition of the people of UniCredit. This is a testament to how well our underlying business is performing. We expect costs to remain broadly flat in the next couple of years on the same perimeter. The perimeter as such will change as we internalize life insurance, complete the merger in Romania and integrate Vodeno/ Aion. And therefore, group fixed costs will increase, although with no impact on the net profit guidance for \u201825 and \u201826. We are increasing our return on tangible equity ambition to circa 17% and are looking to continue EPS and DPS strong growth. Annual average distribution for 2025 and 2026 of greater than for 2024 means that our shareholders will continue to be rewarded handsomely. We also have recently announced that we will increase the dividend accrual from next year to 50%, of net profit from 40%, as a sign of our confidence in the sustainability of our financial performance. And we remain with EUR 6.5 billion of excess capital, which we will return or deploy strictly within our metrics by 2027 latest. The investment case for UniCredit remains exciting and compelling. To conclude, I will leave you with five key reflections on today's results. Today's numbers reflect the output of a fully transformed bank. One that has moved away from retrenchment and is industry leading across all KPIs. These results prove the success of our UniCredit Unlocked strategy and usher in a new era of quality growth. Two, these are record results. With our best ever Q3 and nine months result, marking 15 consecutive quarter of profitable growth with improvement across all key metrics. We have upgraded our guidance for \u201824, given we are operating on a completely new run rate compared to \u201821. Our net profit is 5x higher. Our return on tangible 3x. Our organic capital generation over 2x, supporting our distribution that are more than 2x higher. This new era of sustainable quality growth will be powered by conditions that are unique to our bank. We start from a position of strengths and our structural strengths as a pan-European group are accelerated such as a strategic investment in Vodeno and Commerzbank, and our clear growth trajectory will support that quality growth. Structural strengths include unique geographic client and product mix, underpinned by empowered countries leveraging group skill and scope. Idiosyncratic accelerators defined by our continued transformation initiatives, our line of defense release and strategic flexibility which has allowed us to invest in Vodeno, Romania and Commerzbank. And our clear growth trajectory executed by people passionate about our business proven repeatedly to be able to deliver Alpha. Finally, thanks to our new run rate and the investment we are making. We have great confidence in meeting our \u201825 and \u201826 ambition. Thank you everyone. Let\u2019s move to questions."

So you've increased revenue guidance for this year and I suspect this was mainly driven by NII, though I haven't seen reference to guidance on NII this year or next. Now, Russia's been growing still. Deposit remuneration has been stable. Italy and Germany have had a strong quarter and you still have tailwinds from the replicating portfolio. Can you maybe just talk us through your expectations for NII into 2025, please? That's my first question. The second question is on the investment. You've bought a stake that gives you optionality. I think you've said that clearly. This may or may not lead to a deal. I think in your remarks this morning to the media, you've also talked about this being a long process and you've cautioned it will take time and you want to convince Commerzbank stakeholders that M&A can create value, sort of implying that not all of the stakeholders are on the same page. Now, we're talking about an intra-market deal and I think it's important not just for UniCredit and Commerzbank, but for Europe as a whole in terms of signaling. So my question for you is, what hurdles do you think we still need to overcome for this to move forward, given that I suspect by now you've engaged with all the key stakeholders? Thank you."

So we expect a moderate reduction of NII next year and this should be partially offset by fees, but we confirmed that next year bottom line will not budge or beat this year. So there are a number of other dynamics in the P&L that will allow us to do that. With respect to Commerzbank, this started as an investment and is an investment today and nothing else. So we are the largest investor in Commerzbank today, and as such, we are positive and excited that Commerzbank is now setting a course to improve its performance. With respect to anything else, like in any of the situation, there will need to be a discussion with all the stakeholders at Commerzbank or around Commerzbank before we move any further. If you look at the timeline, the timeline is by definition longer than many people have been considering, but has a limit at some point, given that we cannot be invested forever without taking a decision of in or out. But I would not look at that decision being taken before a year from now."

And do you see the German Trade Union at Commerzbank as a hurdle to delivering cost synergies? And what concessions do you think you have to offer to get them onboard? And then, sorry, just to clarify on the NII, like also could just mention on the modest reduction, what rate assumptions do you make for next year? And if we're looking at 2% average ECB rates for next year, can you provide just like where you think the offset is on the sensitivity rates?

So I think there are a number of stakeholders that are critical to the success of the transaction. First and foremost, the employee representatives in Germany, but also German institution, German clients, German public opinion. So it takes time for the facts to sink and for all of these constituencies to being able to discuss openly what a transaction would mean. And therefore, it's very premature to discuss anything about that. There isn't anything on the table at the moment. There never was. At the moment, what there is, is an investor that has bought 21% and is very keen that that investment yields positively to us. But the process of engaging with all the key stakeholders will take some time. At the end of that period or that time, we will assess where we are and as a function of that, we will take a decision as to whether we will do something more or stay as we are or sell out."

In relation to the Euribor assumption for next year, so we are expecting, first of all, the deposit facility rate, let's say around 3% this year, so end of \u201824, going around 2% at the end of 2025. All-in-all, we are expecting that the average Euribor next year will be below 2.5%. You can assume, on average between 2.2% and 2.3%. In relation to the commercial trend, we are expecting all-in-all a stability of volumes, both on loans and deposit side, with a slight increase in the credit spread. So we have already experienced during this quarter an increase in the credit spread. We are also expecting a slight increase in the credit spread next year. Just a reminder, one basis point increase in the credit spread for us is around EUR 40 million more net interest income. In relation to Russia, due to the compression, but also different assumption in relation to rates, we are expecting a few hundred million less of contribution from Russia next year."

So just understanding basically why that is and how concerned actually might you be about German asset quality continuing to deteriorate.

Thank you."

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "So Germany, first of all, important to take into consideration that German asset quality and also default rate this quarter has been impacted by a big ticket. We experienced in the nine months the impact arriving from a couple of big tickets. The overall cost of risk of Germany in the quarter was around 16 basis points. When we look to the default rate, the default rate was above one, including this effect of this ticket. So it was around 1.4. But indeed, if you are taking into consideration the default rate here to-date, adjusted for these big tickets, that's a large corporate, the default rate is below one. So it's 0.7. So in a way, is in line with the same trend of last year. So this is confirming that overall the performance of the portfolio is not deteriorating. So we're not seeing such a deterioration. Like, let's say in other countries, we do have overlays in Germany as well. The overall stock overlays is remaining flat at the end of this quarter to around EUR 1.7 billion. In relation to the impact that they are having from strategic transactions, so I will start from this quarter. So in this quarter, we had around 26 basis points in terms of impact that are coming from strategic transactions. Slightly more than 10 basis points is connected with Commerzbank. Around 15 basis points is connected to the commitment that we have to purchase Aion/Vodeno, Allianz Life in Italy, and Alpha in Romania. We will have further impacts deriving from this acquisition in Q4 and during the course of 2025. In Q4, such an impact can arrive up to 30 basis points, deriving fundamentally from the finalization of Alpha in Romania and from Aion/Vodeno. Aion/Vodeno can also cross the year, but currently we're assuming to have the impact by year end. Next year we will have the finalization of the internalization of the insurance. We will have until the full application of the Danish compromise, a further impact for around 20 basis points. That will be completely offset by the application of the Danish compromise."

        "text": "Yes, good morning, everybody. So two quick questions for me. So the first one, more broadly, if we were to see tariffs imposed on European exports, how would that impact the outlook for your corporate clients, both in terms of credit costs, but also loan demand? And then second, on asset productivity, how would you expect to \u2013 the revenue to RWA picture to evolve in Italy over the next 12 months? Clearly, the progress there has been very strong. But as you start to absorb the impact of falling rates and there's some other levers you can pull to limit the decline in asset productivity, and perhaps how do you think that picture or the picture on that topic more broadly compares to your peers in Italy who may be a bit more focused on revenues versus asset productivity itself? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Stefano Porro ",
        "text": "So, I will start from the second. So in relation to the impacts from rates that are having -- the effect on profitability, for sure there will be an impact. But let's consider the impact they're having from the strategy. So, the strategy is assuming a further increase in fees for the group, but for Italy as well, coped with a lending that is a profitable lending. So, we have commented more than once the net interest income return on capital. So, we will have an impact in Italy deriving from the Euribor reduction. All in all, this will impact the net interest income. However, we're expecting to have a revenue to risk weighted asset average above 9% also from 2025 onwards. In relation to the lending trends and also the expectation of the lending trend for the future, let's start from this quarter. So this quarter, the average loan stock was down around 3 billion. More specifically, a part of that was Russia. So 700 of that was Russia. We grew more than one in Eastern Europe, and we had a reduction in Germany and in Italy. The reduction is mainly on the corporate side, and the phenomenon is also different in comparison to what we experienced in the first part of the year. The expectation is connected to the level of the rates and the GDP, in the sense that on the level of the rates, we have already commented before, that's positive for the lending. The GDP in the Western Europe countries, we believe, will be around one. So, all in all, we are expecting a stability in the stock of lending with demand growing up, especially on the short term and progressively during 2025 or some of the medium term. We will grow in Central and Eastern Europe, where we are expecting more stability in terms of dynamic of the stock in Italy and Germany. The improvement in the demand for credit, we will believe it will be progressive. So it will not be sharp immediately after the reduction of the rates, but it will be progressive during the course of 2025."

And what do you think about the option of the Danish Compromise Square, i.e. leaving goods with deduction at the insurance unit when acquiring companies about book value via the insurance unit?

        "text": "So we start from Germany net interest income in the quarter. So first of all, there was a positive effect around EUR 40 million, just slightly less than that. That was positive for Germany, negative for the Group Corporate Centre because we started transferring a part of the trading-related activity from Germany to the parent company. So this is around EUR 40 million. Then there is close to EUR10 million effect deriving from some write-backs on non-performing loans that positively impacted the quarter. However, I have to say that there was also a positive trend from the commercial perspective, especially when we are looking to the pricing. So if we look at the average credit spread of the loan book in Germany, there was an increase of around 3 basis points quarter-on-quarter that, as a consequence, positively impacted the net interest income."

I think that the Danish Compromise is, let's say, an arbitrage, and I do think that if it is abused too much, it is going to be reviewed. So, my view is that there are some things where we could all argue that the RWE density is excessive, etc. This is one where we have an advantage and it all balances. But if it becomes too much, I think we can see repercussions. That would be my view of it. So we are internalizing insurance, these bank insurance activities, they have a certain dynamic, and within the broader risk profile of a group, it works. I think if that starts becoming excessive, we may have regulators taking a different position on it, but this is just a perception for me. With respect to Germany, definitely within one year."

In case you decide to go for a full acquisition of commerce, do you think you will be always able to maintain the above EUR 8.6 billion distribution guidance also in the year of the integration or not? And related to this, do you think that the combined bank requires lower, higher common equity or one target compared to the 12.5%, 13% you referred before? And the question on commission income. So year-on-year growth remains pretty strong, close to 9%. So, how do you see this trending in the coming quarters and in the coming years? And also this quarter, you had quite a bit of support from client hedging fees. And how recurring is this type of income? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Stefano Porro ",
        "text": "Okay, so I will start from fees. So effectively in the quarter, we had double-digit growth in many fee categories. So, including the client hedging one. So on the investment side, on financing and advisory side, and also the client hedging fee. All in all, in the client hedging fee, I have to say that apart from some volatility deriving from some specific moment or some quarters, all in all, we're able to generate a pretty, let's say, resilient stock of fees over time. In relation to the dynamic in future, we are expecting that apart from the volatility deriving from the market and the rebalancing of the portfolio by the clients, that will affect the investment fees. If you look at the investment fees and the gross sales, this year on average, we have done by quarter around EUR 13 billion of gross sales in every quarter, right? So quarter one, quarter two, quarter three. I don't believe that we can have a repetition of that, let's say, every year. Having said that, the stock of the asset under management will grow, and so the asset under management fee will grow up. In relation to the other component, we are expecting a contribution from advisory financing also during the course of 2025 and 2026. And the client hedging fees, as I told you, apart from general effect deriving from volatility, we believe that thanks to increasing the perimeter coverage of the clients, we can also assume a growth rate in 2025 in relation to the specific items. Having said that, we believe that there are items like non-life insurance and payments that can generate an higher growth in comparison to client hedging fee."

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Let me take the other two. So capital, a few things. One, my conviction is that you don't make profitability and distribution by leveraging your capital. So you will always have us as on the conservative end of the capital in terms of CET1. Then two considerations, however. The first consideration is Balfour. The most of our Balfour impact is operational risk. But if you think about it, we have the same operational risk today that we will have next year and the years after that. The operational risk today is evaluated through advanced models and through a historic series that put it quite low. It is, if I may, artificial, but it gets boosted so much in a standardized way, and it doesn't differentiate between institutions. So like-for-like, my 12.5, 13 should be 60, 70 basis points lower. We're not doing that, but just for you to understand how we think about it. With respect to a larger acquisition, again, we would not leverage ourselves to do an acquisition. Over time, we need to look at what is the right capital for the business. And we note that some competitors are at 12 or just at 12. Some others are 12.5. We have not had to address that issue because we've been so much higher than where we were targeting. But, I think these are all considerations. But the pressure of, we need to get to certain profitability or we need to get to certain distribution, therefore we take capital down and we leverage is not going to be one that we do. On distributions, first of all, there is no deal on the table. Second of all, quite difficult to have a crystal ball of what the deal could be. I would go with principles which usually are more binding than the numbers. We're very committed to rewarding our shareholders. We understand that the level of distribution is a key driver. And whatever we do should be viewed in a way that within a realistic period of time, our distribution on a per share basis go up, not down. Because otherwise, as we all went through school in finance, why would we do that if the cash flows or the dividends declined? Okay, it would be a destruction of value. So, we're very committed to giving a best in class distribution to our shareholders. But best in class distribution was mostly share buyback in the first three years of activity because we viewed so much on express value in our shares that, in my opinion, it was a no brainer. As we move up and the rate of growth is less, we have gradually tilted towards cash dividends because it is probably better reflective of a sustainable growth path that we want to have going forward. And that concept will remain. Now, to answer your question more directly, we will do everything we can do to not dilute well. Firstly, we do that acquisition, our dividend payout does not move. It's 50%, it stays 50%. Secondly, we will do everything we can to maintain the dividend per share to at least equal to what we have before the acquisition. That does not mean we will succeed in year one, but we're very, very confident we can do that or better in year two and beyond. Thirdly, with respect to the share buyback, I'll give you an alternative interpretation. Until today, we've done share buybacks. Why? We've done share buybacks to reduce the share count at an attractive rate and propel furthers the EPS and the DPS going forward. Right. So we've done that to inject more growth into our EPS and our DPS. But there is an alternative view of things. I could keep the share count stable and increase further my EPS and DPS by having more earnings and more dividends. An acquisition is the use of my excess capital, and to a certain extent, it could also be the use of some of my share buyback at the initial point to buy more earnings, which generates more dividend and therefore propel my EPS and DPS. So it's just an alternative view of things. When we stabilize, let's take it like that. And I tell people that if they talk to me about five years or whatever, I'm not listening. For me, stabilize is year two onward. The first year is always a little bit like that. When we stabilize, our philosophy of distributions should not move a lot, which means we will have distribution that are a high percentage of a net income generated. In which mix? Well, we will see what is best for our shareholders. Is it 50% cash dividend and 50% share buyback? Is it 60% cash dividend and 40% share buyback? I cannot say. Today, it's too much speculation. But I think if you look at the principle I know and the management team and the board know full well that we have a distribution policy. It needs to be defended, and if we find a way to strengthen the bank, grow the bank, and improve the distribution policy a little bit later by taking maybe a little bit of uncertainty in the year one, that is something we can do. If it takes more than that, this touches on our strict criteria of investment. And we will not do that. And I hope that that answers your question."

        "text": "Hi. Good morning. One quick question on your organic capital generation. You continue quarter after quarter to surprise us on the strength of this, which is linked to profitability but also to the capital efficiency measure. I read a comment about the support by organic capital generation, the best-in-class distribution for the ambition for 2025 and 2026. Can you give us a little bit of color on what the organic capital generation could look like, also in light of the fact that maybe there could be some lending growth?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "So I will give you a broad picture. And I'm sure Stefano will add. So, organic capital generation, the organic capital generation comes from two sources. One is, let's call it commercial or current. And that is the earnings quality. If I go for volume in NII, I will not have a lot of capital generation. If I have more fee-to-revenue, I will have a lot of capital generation. So, what we have done in these last four years is to improve the profitability of NII to prepare for a time when, due to rates decline and cost of risk increase, NII will be contributing less to our profitability, because obviously we will be making a lower margin in general. And we have also done that by continuously increasing our fees, because fees have a one-to-one capital generation. That's the commercial one. The commercial one will slightly tilt in the future. On the one hand, you're going to have the exact mirror image of what you've had in the last four years. In these last four years, most European banks have had declining volume, increasing margin. That is paradise for capital generation. As rates go down, you're going to have increasing volume and decreasing margin. This is how it goes exactly in the opposite direction, i.e., in order to maintain, you need to do more volume, to do more volume, you're consuming more capital. Where we come from, we're declining, so we consume less capital, but the margin is carrying the revenue to RWAs. Every bank will have pressure on revenue to RWAs going forward. We think that that pressure we can minimize by the mix of client and product. So, moving the mix of product towards consumer, away from mortgages, allows us to have more insulation in the margin, which allows us to be less hit by a compression of margins that would happen later. So, we've worked on that on one side. On the fees, obviously, the more fees you have as a total of revenue, those are capital neutral, and those generate one-to-one. So, this is the commercial and how you do it. So, if you look at the commercial for the next three years, the overall revenue, making EUR 1 of revenue or EUR 1 revenue, it will generate less capital organically than what it has generated in the past three years. That's true from everybody. Our job is to minimize that less. Then there is another driver. The other driver that we had was that in 2021, we had a very inefficient portfolio of lending and usage of capital. And over the last four years, we have made it more and more and more and more efficient. So now, I would say that most of our lending book is adjusted for risk above the cost of equity. I would say probably 70%, 75% of it. Can we take it to 80%, 85%? Yes. Can we take it to 100%? No. It's never the case because you will have decision on, I'll do this loan to this client. It's below my cost of equity, but I'll give him three years to mature because I want the growth, et cetera. So, the advantage we have been crystallizing through that is going to run to zero. When will it run to zero? Well, it depends, but we think that by the end of 2025, we're probably done with that. So, that extra boost that has allowed us to do something that seems to defy gravity, i.e. generate more capital than our net income, is going to converge down from \u201826 onward. However, because there is always a however, Stefano will also give you a view on infamous DTAs, which are going to be capital positive from sometime in 26 for the next two or three years. And so, the relay from the portfolio, from the old portfolio, will be taken by the crystallization of the value on capital of the DTAs. And this is a good point to pass it to Stefano."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Stefano Porro ",
        "text": "So, some data points. \u201824, the organic capital generation is around 400 basis points adjusted for extraordinary transactions. So, not taking into consideration extraordinary transactions. After this, more than 300 is the profit, and then the balance is a risk-weighted asset. When we look to 2025, as we have already highlighted, both for 2025 and 2026, we are guiding for a profit. So, our ambition is to have a profit of above nine. So, we have an organic capital generation from the profit above 300 basis points. As highlighted by Andrea, during the course of 2025, we are expecting to be able to generate further capital via the management of the risk-weighted asset of the portfolio. This should be able to compensate some model changes effect and the potential growth that are in front of the business, so from the lending. In relation to the model changes, we are expecting to have a few billions that are in front of the model changes in terms of the risk-weighted asset increase in Q4, and a few billions also during the course of 2025. Having said that, this amount, as highlighted, will be offset by the active portfolio management action that we will put in place. From 2026 onwards, we are in a way a target, i.e. something more than 300 basis points of capital generated by the profit, and active portfolio management action that should be, to a lower extent, able to fund the growth of the lending, but the difference is not meaningful in terms of basis points difference. With regards to DTAs, where the benefit to the capital from DTAs is coming from? It's coming from utilization of tax loss carry forward. Currently, we have recognized in our balance sheet around 3.4 billion of assets that are related to tax loss carry forward. When we are going to utilize these assets, we are going to have not anymore in the balance sheet an asset that is deducted from the capital. All in all, the contribution to the common equity Tier 1 starting from next year can be between 15 and 20 basis points of contribution to the common equity Tier 1 ratio, positive per year. Again, the reason is source is, utilization of the tax loss carry forward DTAs that we have is fundamental in Italy. Positive effect is between 15 and 20 basis points per year starting from 2025 onwards."

        "text": "Hi, thank you for the time. Just two questions. First of all, on Commerz, can you give us a deadline for you to make a decision on the financial instruments that would raise your stake to 21%? How long can you wait? And I think you said that you will wait for the Commerz Investor Day. I'm not sure if I'm correct. And second, on cost of risk, can you remind us of your guidance for the guidance for 2025 and if it assumes any overlay usage? Thank you."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "So let me start with Commerzbank. So I think let's not confuse two different things. The first one is we have asked the ECB for authorization to move our participation in Commerzbank from 9.5% to up to a maximum of 29.9%, which is the level before you need to launch a bid. We would not be able to move or to convert what you call financial instruments into physical shares or into having the physical shares under our control until we have ECB approval. ECB approval takes 60 days, but the 60 days gets stopped every time there is a new question or there is a new doubt or whatever, and we need to give them back. So, they're not 60 days, they're actually longer. If you tell me when the process will be finished, I will tell you when we move on the financial instrument. I don't know. I don't think at this point in time it makes much of a difference, because at some point within the time that interests us, we will have \u201ccontrol of the shares and everything else\u201d. The second thing that is important is that this is a process that we started to have maximum flexibility. But if there were a process for an acquisition, that follows a completely different process. So, fundamentally, this current ECB approval is not relevant for a full bid on Commerzbank. If we were to do that, that will follow a completely different process, which may go in parallel after, before the 29.9% approval. So the two are not on the critical path of each other. Then I just said, with respect to Investor Day, that given that we believe that the two banks are the mirror image of each other, and we're pretty convinced of what can be done, we are quite interested as a shareholder that has a lot of money on the plate to see what the Investor Day will deliver on bridging some, all, or more than all of the gap that Commerzbank has with HVB in Germany. The second question, the second question, cost of risk and overlays. So, firstly, on cost of risk, we have said that we are confident we can maintain a cost of risk of 20 to 25 basis points through the cycle. Clearly, at the moment, we're running a lot lower. In keeping the cost of risk at 20 to 25 basis point through the cycle, we said that there could be two scenarios to simplify. Scenario A, we have all, particularly I, been too nervous about the credit cycle in Europe, and it's relatively benign. If it is relatively benign, we will be able to keep the cost of risk of our group to 20% to 25%, either not touching or touching the overlays to a minimum level or to a limited level. In this case, we would still need to release them because the overlays are tied, very strictly tied to specific event and to specific situations. And therefore, you would have a profitability of the bank that is actually propelled by the release of the lion's share of the overlays. In the other scenario, which is the other extreme, that the credit cycle is, as we all think, going to be a little bit more daunting. If that is the case, we will cover the 20 to 25 basis points of cost of risk for the cycle through normal LLPs through the years. And the excess, the 20% to 25%, would be insured by releasing the overlays on those situations that we have already identified. So, really, you have really two situations. Above and beyond the fact that we believe that the quality of our loan portfolio is quite good and we've really scrubbed it a and that our ordinary provisions on the conservative side, so we are confident. If the credit cycle is very negative, then we have the overlays to keep it at 20% to 25%. If it's relatively mild, then the overlays still need to be released. But instead of going to cover the excess provision, they will go directly to the bottom line to propel our net income. This is why, when we talked about idiosyncratic accelerator, we use line of defense as one of them, because the overlays will either ensure that our cost of risk is below most of our peers, other peers, or if that's not necessary, propel directly the bottom line by being released. I hope I make sense."

  "2024Q4": {
    "date": "2025-02-11",
    "transcript": "Magda Palczynska: Good morning, and welcome to UniCredit's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Results Conference Call. Andrea Orcel, our CEO, will take you through the presentation. This will be followed by a Q&A session with Andrea and Stefano Porro, our CFO. [Operator Instructions] With that, I hand over to Andrea.\nAndrea Orcel: Good morning. It is my privilege to present the successful completion of the first phase of UniCredit Unlocked crowned by our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results. We're now moving to the second phase of UniCredit Unlocked, Acceleration. This will include our expectations and levers for the next 3 years, the guidance outlook and inorganic activity. Our performance would not be possible without the continued support of all our stakeholders. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our clients for their trust, our shareholders for their belief and unwavering support and, above all, the people of UniCredit whose passion, dedication and hard work make UniCredit what it is. I will start directly with Slide 5, as I speak to all points in Slide 3 and 4 later. UniCredit's transformation from '21 to '24 has been nothing short of exceptional, particularly as it has also consistently delivered outstanding financial results quarter after quarter, while setting a new benchmark for banking. We have unified and refocused the entire organization around a single vision, strategy and culture. We have simplified and streamlined our organization, processes and way of working. We have restored trust and empowerment among our 13 banks and our employees, all coming together as one group. By leveraging our scale, we have put to common denominator our product factories, building an ecosystem of partners. We have put our technology and data under one cohesive framework, driving efficiencies and innovation. These action have been taken putting our client always at the center and have not only transformed UniCredit into a stronger, more competitive institution with leading financial KPIs, but also set us on a trajectory of continued success in the future. While the emphasis shall now shift, our transformation is far from over. We have surpassed all our targets. While macro tailwinds have favored our results in some areas, they have also masked the extent of our achievement. Our 14% net revenue growth was achieved with discipline. NII RoAC increased from 4% to 19% and is now best in the industry. Fees grew 6%, ahead of our peers to 33% of total revenues. The impact of our investment in our factories has just started to show. Despite inflationary pressures, particularly significant in our perimeter, we reduced cost by around \u20ac1.7 billion, while reinvesting circa \u20ac1.4 billion to strengthen our group. Our cost-to-income ratio declined further to 37.9%, despite our complexity, beating peers by a significant margin. Capital efficiency move from laggard to leader, supporting \u20ac26 billion of distribution, 65% more than the original \u20ac16 billion target, while building an excess capital chest of \u20ac6.5 billion, taking \u20ac3.6 billion of integration cost in the period and \u20ac700 million of additional overlays. This excess capital shall now either boost our '25, '27 distribution or provide us with strategic flexibility. Our net profit is more than double what we planned in 2021, no matter which definition you take. Our return on tangible equity is also more than double the UniCredit Unlock target, despite the building of our excess capital. This performance balances, excelling in the short term and preparing for the future. It is a testament to the dependability of UniCredit and its people. UniCredit now consistently delivers quality profitable growth. We have generated positive jaws across all our key metrics. Our revenues have grown while focusing on profitability, rather than volume in our chosen client segments. We not only reduced absolute cost in the face of inflation, but did so while investing for our future and increasing our top line. UniCredit remains a leader in the industry across all KPIs. We begin the next phase of our journey from a position of significant strength. We delivered total shareholder return of 513%, 4x our European peers. We delivered the best share price performance despite derating. We delivered the most generous distribution, whilst building our excess capital. We are strong and able to offset the normalization of macro. We intend to grow our net profit at a high-teens return on tangible equity, delivering the highest sustainable distribution of the peer group. The trajectory ahead for our shareholders remains bright. Let's now focus on our Q4 and full year results in detail. Given the different definition of net profit used by our competitor, let me share ours under the different views. Our stated net profit exceeded \u20ac9.7 billion for the full year. Our net profit, excluding DTAs, is now well ahead of the \u20ac9 billion we guided to, reaching \u20ac9.3 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Both are after absorbing \u20ac1.3 billion in integration costs and legal provision for Russia, without which our beat would have been much greater and with which we further derisk 2025 and beyond. Our underlying net profit without integration cost and the extra legal provision for Russia reached \u20ac10.3 billion, a very strong base. These outstanding bottom line results have been achieved, thanks to strong performance across every single line of our P&L and balance sheet. Net revenue increased 4% to \u20ac24.2 billion in the year, remaining flat in the quarter and up 1.3% if adjusted for the Commerzbank hedge one-off. This is a result of strong profitable NII and fees and low and stable LLPs. Trading profit for the full year would have increased, excluding the one-off impact of the Commerzbank hedge. NII grew on a quarterly and yearly basis, despite the recent decline in rates due to excellent management of the pass-through and our replicating portfolio and investment portfolio results. In the fourth quarter, we also benefited from a \u20ac3 million -- \u20ac30 million contribution from the consolidation of Alpha Bank Romania and a \u20ac50 million one-off in Italy. Our NII remains highly profitable with a RoAC of circa 19%, thanks to our continued focus on our target client segments and product and profitability over volume. Our asset quality remained strong and stable with a gross NPE ratio of 2.6% and a net NPE ratio of 1.4%. Our gross NPE stock is half what it was 4 years ago. Our cost of risk remains structurally low at 15 basis points for the year and 34 basis points for the quarter, including an increase in our specific provision with overlays untouched at \u20ac1.7 billion. We're still benefiting from write-backs confirming quality origination and conservative provisioning. The overall cost of risk is flat year-on-year with a default rate of 1.3% and only 1%, flat versus fourth quarter '23, excluding a single NIM one-off in the fourth quarter. Fee growth has been strong across all categories, accelerating this year and even more so in the quarter, up 9% year-over-year. Our fee to revenue ratio stands at a top-tier 33%, notwithstanding strong quality NII growth, highlighting the quality and diversification of our fee base. Overall fee performance has been driven by continued strong momentum in investment and P&C insurance with growth at 17%, driven by increased client appetite, a broader product offering and our ongoing shift towards affluent and private clients. Strong fee growth will remain central to our future success, fueling capital-light revenues and delivering exceptional results to clients and shareholders. This will allow us to extract positive differential value from any partnership or acquisition that we may make. Over the last 3 years, we have consistently reduced our absolute cost base offsetting inflation while investing in the business. In '24, we further reduced our cost by 0.6%, driven by non-HR down 1.3% and HR cost down 0.1%, despite increasing the remuneration of our people. This quarter, costs were impacted by bonus pool, 2 months of Alpha Romania consolidations and accelerated digital investments. Without this intentional investment, costs would be flat in the quarter and lower still in the year. Our cost/income ratio improved to 37.9%, consistently leading our peer group. From disciplined cost management, combined with target streamlining of our organization, reducing unnecessary overhead and investing efficiency. Our operational excellence has been a key factor in our success, and we intend to maintain it and defend it. Our best-in-class organic capital generation of \u20ac12.6 billion for the year allowed us to absorb headwinds, increased distribution to \u20ac9 billion and maintain a stable CET1 ratio of 15.9%. Active portfolio management reduced RWAs by almost \u20ac13 billion. We now present our region in a way that we believe better represent very individual dynamic. We will separate Italy from Germany, from Austria and pull together Central and Eastern Europe. So let's start with Italy. Our franchise in Italy is market-leading in terms of profitability, efficiency and capital generation by a wide margin. It is UniCredit's quality earnings powerhouse, and its results speak for themselves. Gross revenues grew 4% to \u20ac11.4 billion, driven by both NII, plus 5% and very strong fees, plus 7%. We continue to focus on profitability rather than volume. NII RoAC exceeded 23%, significantly above our peers. All 3 categories grew, with investment and insurance delivering a standout performance of plus 16% and fees to revenue reaching almost 40%. We're leading in terms of our investment products growth in Italy. Operational efficiency improved further. Costs were down despite growth and investment in technology and our people, allowing us to reach a cost/income ratio of 34.5%, unparalleled in the country. Capital efficiency improved yet again with net revenues over RWAs of 10.5%. Net profit rose 10% to \u20ac4.4 billion. RoAC reached 31%, the best in Italy. As a result, organic capital generation reached \u20ac5.5 billion, again, well in excess of our net profit, underscoring the quality and profitability of our growth. This outstanding performance provides the firepower to constantly deliver innovative solution and support for our client. This year alone, we facilitate almost \u20ac11 billion in financing to support Italian SMEs, none of which would be possible without our people. We welcomed over 1,000 new team members this year and launched professional retraining and upskilling initiatives, delivering 1.3 million hours through UniCredit University. Germany. Our German bank is the most profitable and efficient in the country with the best balance between gross and profitable NII and quality fees. One of our two key anchors for the group, it delivered its highest profit ever. This is the financial result of our successful transformation. Gross revenue grew 1% to \u20ac5.5 billion, driven by fees, up 3% to \u20ac1.6 billion, accelerating plus 8% in the quarter. Fees compensated NII, down 3.5% in the quarter, while maintaining the leading NII RoAC in the country, above 18%. Operational efficiency improved yet again. Costs were down 8%, despite growth and investment in technology and people. Cost income declined to below 41%. Capital efficiency improved yet again with net revenues over RWAs of 7.5%. Net profit rose 12% to \u20ac1.9 billion. RoAC reached 20%. As a result, organic capital generation reached \u20ac2.8 billion, well in excess of net profit. Our disciplined approach to profitable growth stands out. We have restrained ourselves from chasing some competitors who have recently significantly reduced pricing to inflate revenue, which are well below the cost of equity and will impact the profitability over time. This success is thanks to the caliber of people who make our business. In the last year, we hired more than 300 new colleagues and announced the creation of over 140 new jobs as part of our integration of a custody business. We have been awarded Top Employee Germany for the 15th time in a row. Our team is united behind a common vision and ambition and in a market-leading position from which now accelerate. Austria. Our bank in Austria is the most profitable and efficient bank in the country. The second anchor to our group, it continues its transformation, showing improvements on every line and delivering its best net profit ever. Gross revenues grew 3% to \u20ac2.7 billion, driven by fees, up 8% due to strong investment and client hedging fees and resilient NII, plus 2%. We are maintaining discipline as competitor chase volumes, reflected in our NII RoAC of 15%, well ahead of all peers. Operational efficiency improved yet again. Costs were down more than 1%, despite growth and investment in technology and in people. Our cost-to-income ratio declined below 38%. Capital efficiency improved yet again with net revenues over RWAs of 7%. Net profit rose 14% to \u20ac1.3 billion. RoAC reached 24%. As a result, organic capital generation reached \u20ac1.5 billion, again, in excess of our net profit. We supported the growth of our SMEs through the provision of \u20ac3.4 billion in new lending and rolled out a digital credit decision engine to provide SMEs faster access to it. We kept a strong focus on supporting our customers, employees and communities, launching a special tranche of mortgage loans with favorable conditions for young families. And under the umbrella of UniCredit University Austria, we continued expanding our development and upskilling program, while our new well-being framework reached more than 1,000 people. Central and Eastern Europe. Our Central and Eastern Europe franchise also leads in profitability and efficiency. It is the growth engine of our group. It demonstrated excellent performance as our local countries lead in their own right in their individual markets, whilst leveraging benefits from our group-wide factories, network and platforms. Gross revenues grew 8% to \u20ac4.5 billion driven by fees, plus 13% and resilient NII, plus 5% with an NII RoAC of 26%. We're maintaining discipline without sacrificing market share as competitors chase volumes. Operational efficiency improved yet again with cost income at 33%, whilst capital efficiency remained high with net revenue over RWAs at 8.7%. Net profit rose 3% to \u20ac2.2 billion. RoAC reached 30%. Organic capital generation reached \u20ac1.6 billion. I would like to underscore that Central and Eastern Europe, underlying growth is twice that of the core European Union with low FX risk. We have unchallenged leadership in corporate and a significantly growing retail contribution, which should further be enhanced by our reentry in Poland, leveraging Vodeno-Aion. 4 banks contribute 70% of our region's revenue. In Bulgaria and Croatia, we have a leadership position in both retail and corporates. In Romania, we are top tier. And in Romania and Czech and Slovakia, we lead in corporate. We are complementing and accelerated by our other 5 banks, which, while smaller, deliver outstanding performance. This year alone, we upskilled 900 branch managers, set up bespoke initiative to recognize and nurture talent within our Gen Z cohort. We continued with our dedicated development to build a solid pipeline of future managers. Russia. We have been working towards an accelerated orderly wind down of Russia from day 1. Always, within both the letter and the spirit of a complex legal, regulatory and sanctioned limitation. We met the target communicated in H1, 1 year early. Local deposits declined to \u20ac900 million, 89% down since first quarter '22. Net local loans declined to \u20ac1 billion, 86% down since first quarter '22. Cross-border exposure declined 94% to date and will become practically nil this year. We minimized our loss to only 11% of principal. Cross-border payment are below $10 billion, 64% down since Q1 '22. We are now almost exclusively in Europe and U.S. dollar. We have reduced the capital impact of a full write-down of Russia from circa 130 basis points on a 14% CET1 in Q1 2022 to now circa 50 basis points, 10 basis points lower than recently on a 16% CET1 today. We are now compliant with this ECB order. Turning to our product factories. We see strong delivery of our sustainable capital-light fee-based revenue. Client Solutions revenue grew by 9% to \u20ac11.3 billion, 2/3 are fees, up 8%. Individual Solutions rose by 14% to \u20ac3.3 billion, driven by investments, up 18% and protection up 13%. We're increasing the use of our market products within our investment offering to create better solutions for our clients. Our onemarket funds reached \u20ac14.5 billion, and our own Managed Funds gross to total sales reached 31%, up from 14% in 2023. Corporate Solutions revenue rose by 9% to \u20ac5.4 billion, driven by client risk management up 17% and advisory and financing, up 6%. Payment Solutions rose 4% to \u20ac2.3 billion, driven by payment, up 7%. We are entering the next phase on UniCredit Unlocked, in which we focus on accelerating our top line, driven profitable growth. Our goal is to solidify our position as the leading Pan-European bank and further widen the gap versus competitors. The industry faces headwinds, such as net interest income pressure, cost inflation, normalization of risk, Russia and ongoing digital evolution. We are confident in our ability to complete our transformation while building on our unique structural advantages through targeted Alpha initiatives. This will allow us to not only overcome the impact of headwinds on our record net profit, but also grow it to over \u20ac10 billion, excluding DTAs, maintaining return on tangible in the high teens and our organic capital generation broadly in line with net profit. Structural advantages. Our road map is clear, we are a transformed bank, now harnessing its structural advantages, which are an attractive geographic footprint, combined with a quality client and product mix to deliver superior profitable growth and distribution over time. We operate as a federation of 13 individually empowered banks, each executing independently, yet benefiting from being part of one group. This profitable and diversified footprint, Italy's quality earnings anchored by Germany and Austria resilience and powered by our Central and Eastern European growth engine strikes the ideal balance between highly capital generative, stable markets and dynamically expanding one. We serve 15 million clients, with 60% of our revenues from high-value segments, such as SME, private and affluent, and we intend to increase that weight. By leveraging our global product offering, centralized procurement and technology and data infrastructure at scale will further enhance our competitive edge. This is how we drive our fee to revenue ratio towards 40%, outpacing market growth through internalization, superior fee and profitable lending products. No other peer is in such a favorable position. Alpha initiatives. To build on our structural strengths, our targeted Alpha initiatives are split into commercial and operational. Together, they support our ambition financial goals, ensuring we continue to build on our momentum and unlock new avenues of value creation. Turning to our geography. All regions will maintain strong performance throughout the plan. Italy, our powerhouse for quality earnings, will see its share of group net profit shift from 45% to around 40%. Having benefited most from rising rates, Italy will feel the impact of rate reversal more acutely, yet the quality of its earnings will continue to improve. Fees as a share of revenue will rise from circa 40% to 48%. NII RoAC will normalize at 17%, well ahead of cost of equity. The overall country RoAC will normalize at 25%. Germany and Austria, both high-rated economies, serve as resilient anchors for our group. They have benefited much less from the positive rates impact, hence, are now much more resilient on the way down. Combined with the continued improvements in their operational and capital efficiency and their readiness to now again gain profitable market share, Germany and Austria will bring their net profit contribution to 35% and RoAC to 22%. Finally, Central and Eastern Europe. Our proven engine of profitable growth will increase its contribution to about 20% -- 25% of net profit, despite a normalization of provision. Their growth should then accelerate from there. The region's operational and capital excellence will persist. Their cost/income ratio will further reduce to 31%, with RoAC reaching 30% and strong top line growth. This attractive diversified geographic mix will allow UniCredit to deliver superior profitable growth and capital generation, supporting outsized distribution. Building on the structural advantages, we will strategically increase allocated capital and investment across all regions. We will, however, prioritize those with the highest profitability and growth potential, with Central and Eastern Europe receiving the most but all regions growing. Our clients remain at the heart of our strategy. While we strive to add value to all, our growth initiative focus on targeting the most attractive segment with strong capital-light potential, we're decisively shifting our focus towards SMEs and private and affluent individuals, which currently account for 60% of our revenues and 75% of our fee growth going forward. We have built market-leading product factories that enable us to better serve our clients' diverse financial needs, a key competitive advantage. The impact that these factories are having on each one of our 13 franchise and now also on that of our partner in Greece demonstrate the significant value we can unlock not only internally, but in any acquisition. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in these factories and improve their connection to the end client, adding an additional \u20ac1.4 billion in fee growth by the end of our plan. Our ambition is to offer a truly integrated experience that blends digital innovation with personalized human interaction across both retail and corporate. This is done through the continued enhancement of our distribution model and channels, coupled with a team of motivated professional providing prompt, high-quality advice rooted in local expertise. Meanwhile, our digital channels are secure, user-friendly and increasingly capable of delivering an exceptional customer experience. Through our corporate portals, client receive personalized solution in the areas of transactional payments, trade finance, factoring, client risk management, regardless of their location. Our mobile channels provide on-the-go services tailored for digital-first lifestyles. By seamlessly integrating these channels, we can serve clients when, where and how they prefer 24/7, delivering bespoke outstanding survey and support at all times. Bringing it all together, by leveraging our attractive geographies, our factories and our channels, we will be able to become the go-to bank for our clients. While we have achieved strong NPS gains, our true priority lies in providing a distinctive experience that sets us completely at par from our peer group. We aspire to become the benchmark for quality when clients think about financial services. Our linchpin. Our people are the linchpin between our commercial and operating machine. They are the most valuable asset and what ultimately makes our ambition possible. We remain committed to investing in them. We believe that by empowering them, developing them, offering them clear career opportunities, they will achieve professional fulfillment. While not yet there, we are committed to continue on this path. We reward talent transparently. We have increased nonexecutive bonuses by 30% over the last 2 years, higher than those of executive. We offer the highest VAP in Italy, for example. In parallel, we aim to foster an inclusive, engaging culture by promoting employee-led initiatives, most of the 2,000 simplification initiatives we have rolled out came bottom up from our people and not top down. Our gender pay gap was 4% when we started the plan. We practically closed it today. Our ultimate goal is to create an environment in which our employees feel connected, valued and empowered because they are the driving force behind our continued success. Let's move to the Operating Machine, an organization and processes. Our operating machine has undergone a major overhaul to better support our business and create further value for our clients. We streamlined organizational structure, flattened the hierarchies and focused resources on high-impact areas, enabling our teams to act more swiftly. By eliminating inefficiencies, our cost base remained flat, whilst funding investment. We're increasingly leveraging technology and AI to automate and reduce complexity, improving our ways of working and redirecting savings towards business growth. And the results speak for themselves. Time to approval for a consumer loan in Italy dropped from over 24 hours to just 25 minutes, with more improvement on the way, and you will see them this year. We will continue to identify and remove inefficiency, accelerate automation and use of data, whilst treating every process, workflows and organizational structure as a blank slate for continuous improvement. Our digital strategy revolves around 2 core imperative. First, uncompromised reliability, security and compliance fully aligned with local and ECB regulation. Two, outcome-driven technology investment with every euro spent demonstrating that it can deliver a clear return and meet specific business organizational needs. Our ultimate ambition is to develop a digital foundation that not only meets but surpasses best-in-class peers and is able to compete with fintechs. Our IT spend is in line with or above our peers. That said, the efficiency of our spend has significantly improved, and we believe trends towards market-leading, allowing us to achieve more with less. With respect to technology and data, investing in the right initiative and with the lowest unit cost is far more important than the headline number of what one spends. Our security measures have become ever more effective, reflected in our reduction of incidents by 67% over 3 years. We have consolidated our data centers and reskilled our digital workforce, improving our tech to non-tech ratio by 18 percentage points. We maintain proactive oversight of regulatory requirement bolstered by a robust digital operational resilience strategy. We are now in a position to accelerate, leveraging technology, data and AI to elevate our performance to the next level. By continually experimenting to meet evolving needs, we're driving innovation and expanding our offering across multiple integrated platform and channel. You will increasingly see the outcome of that. Our ambition is to build our capacity to transform, evolving with a changing environment and the needs of our clients and ensuring we continue to provide outstanding products and services. To do so, we have and will continue to invest. We are planning to add \u20ac2.5 billion of IT investment over the plan, delivering IT projects at a lower unit cost and faster time to market, as a result of the disciplined focus on efficiency within our IT and AI spend. Vodeno-Aion. UniCredit's latest acquisition, Vodeno-Aion, is a proprietary technology and fintech solution that aligns perfectly with our acceleration. It combines all the aspects of our Alpha initiatives. Our initial pilots consist of reentering the Polish market, expanding in select Western and European countries and offering embedded finance solution. Thanks to Vodeno-Aion's high flexibility, extremely low cost to serve and quick time to market, we have the ambition to add 2.5 million clients and build the business with a meaningful impact on group net profit, a RoAC above 25% and a cost income ratio of 34% within 3 years. We plan to progressively invest up to \u20ac200 million on an iterative basis with a payback of under 2 years. Our guidance on cost already includes the maximum investment that we expect to make. In summary, our Alpha initiatives and our investment in Vodeno-Aion are at the base of our organic -- of our exciting organic growth story, a story that, together with the finalization of our transformation will allow us to absorb expected future headwinds in full and significantly grow without diluting profitability in our distributions. Similarly to Phase 1 of UniCredit Unlocked, we are again setting ambitious targets for Phase 2. Our ambition is to match 2024 record net profit in 2025, absorbing all headwinds and grow from there to circa \u20ac10 billion, excluding DTAs by 2027. We're determined to do so, maintaining a return on tangible equity in excess of 17% and an average '25, '27 organic capital generation broadly in line with our net profit. Together with the return of our excess capital, we aim to distribute more than in '24 in each of the next 3 years. 50% of net profit will be in cash. This would result in 6 years of improving performance and growth at an increasing margin over our cost of equity, coupled with best-in-class distribution. This should lead to a significant re-rating of our stock. We're excited about the challenge and determined to meet it. While we are realistic with respect to the challenges from a macro environment that will normalize, we believe that we are the best place to deliver the differential value and growth necessary to offset it and grow. We have built unique line of defense, including \u20ac1.7 billion of overlays to insulate us from the cost of risk cycle. We have front-loaded nonoperating items and extraordinary charges equal to \u20ac1.3 billion in 2024 alone, absorbing these within our beat of net profit and distribution. These should trend to 0 over the plan. Together with the strengths of our transformed group and our Alpha initiatives in flight, these lines of defense will derisk the achievement of our net profit ambition. Finally, we will have \u20ac6.5 billion excess capital to return to our shareholders by '27, which will further derisk our distribution. 2025 is the year of interest rate normalization, cost of risk trending up, inflationary pressure on cost and for us, further Russia compression. We expect NII to decline over mid-single digits, starting from a high base. This includes some loan growth for the group that is driven by Central and Eastern Europe. Our cost of risk should remain stable at around 15 basis points, including partial overlay usage. Fees and net insurance result should grow by more than 5%, as past investment increasingly deliver. As a reminder, in the second quarter, we expect to start reporting the insurance line as a separate line in our P&L. Trading high in '24 should reduce by a couple of hundred million, mainly due to the negative effect of lower rates on the funding of the trading book. The other revenue line should reduce by a couple of hundred million, as '24 benefited from some one-off and the contribution from insurance is reflected elsewhere. This leads to net revenue over \u20ac23 billion. Cost on the same perimeter would be slightly down. On the expanded perimeter, they will be around \u20ac9.6 billion with cost/income targeted at around 40%. Nonoperating and extraordinary item will significantly reduce, providing a large buffer to absorb any operating profit shortfall. This is protection of our results. Both stated net profit, including DTAs and net profit, excluding DTAs, are expected to be broadly in line with 2024. RWAs will increase to around \u20ac300 billion due to the impact of Basel IV models, changes and strategic investment, partly offset by further portfolio action. Basel IV impact will be around 80 basis points for the first quarter and 60 basis points for the full year, mostly from the standardization of operational risk models. Distributions are expected to be greater than in '24. We're confident we can continue to deliver strong EPS and DPS growth. Phase 2 of UniCredit Unlocked sees us shifting our focus on top line profitable growth while completing our transformation, aiming to maintain our leadership in operating and capital excellence, while investing in digital data and our people. We aim to achieve \u20ac10 billion of net profit, excluding DTA, by '27. Stated net profit and net profit should converge as DTAs should disappear. Hence, you should compare the \u20ac10 billion ambition with the \u20ac9.3 billion of today. We intend to distribute in each of the next 3 years more than '24, with 50% of net profit in cash. This is supported by a 17% return on tangible and average organic capital generation broadly in line with net profit and the return of our excess capital. We continue to target strong EPS and DPS growth. Our target CET1 currently remain between 12.5% and 13%, notwithstanding the impact of Basel IV and model changes, particularly on operational risk, not substantially changing our risk. We have just gone through Phase 2 of UniCredit Unlocked, which remains our main focus and a compelling base case that we believe will deliver positively differentiated performance and distribution versus our peers. Any M&A activity shall be executed solely if it further enhances our base case, solely if it further enhances our base case. It must be consistent with our strategy and meet our strict financial criteria, delivering returns that compare favorably to buying back our own shares. This is a high bar. We're not afraid to walk away, if not met and demonstrated this much so far. BPM. At the offer price, despite its valuation at a significant price earning and price to distribution premium to ours has enough potential to add value to meet our criteria. Commerzbank, still an investment, fully hedged on the downside. Our ability to add massive value to Commerzbank is demonstrated by HVB's transformation in only 3 years, but we would only make an offer at the right terms and conditions. There is no risk of overlap between these 2 potential deals as they would be sequential and would be led by separate local management teams in separate legal entities overseen by separate regulators. Just for transparency, we are about to announce that our total holding in Generali, including position that we hold on behalf of our client, has crossed the 5% threshold. This does not change our position on the stake, which remains financial and does not imply any interest to acquire the company of the like. A UniCredit-BPM combination would build a stronger #2 in Italy. Network and client franchise are complementary and would be highly protected. The combined client base of \u20ac12 million would be further tilted towards UniCredit's targeted segments, affluent, private and especially SMEs in which we do not expect any concentration issue, instead seeing significant growth potential. The combination allows BPM to access scale, benefiting from UniCredit's greater balance sheet, factories, superior investment firepower, particularly in the areas of technology, data and AI and the network. BPM clients would all benefit from a refurbished branch network and an improved branch network, integrated physical and digital channels, premium product factories, including consumer finance, asset management and insurance, superior capital and balance sheet strengths, meaning, improved lending capacity, access to UniCredit's Pan-European network. BPM's people would be offered better career development, opportunities and reward. Any cost efficiency will be made with limited impact on the network, as the efficiency will be focused on non-business overhead, back end of the bank and external providers. This approach was effectively delivered at UniCredit and in full cooperation with trade unions. Italy will benefit from the bank's enhanced ability to support local community, institutions and family. We offer a price that incorporated a 15% premium to BPM's undisturbed share price, the level prior to the announcement of the offer on Anima where 100% acquisition is not a forgone conclusion and further M&A speculation linked to a potential combination, one which is now off the table. We are offering all BPM's stakeholder an opportunity for strong certain and rewarding future. There is a clear performance gap between the 2 banks today. UniCredit Italy is the most profitable and efficient bank in the country by a wide margin. In terms of gross revenue growth, we outperformed BPM by 10 percentage points between '21 and '24 comparable 9 months period. In terms of capital efficiency, our net revenue to RWA is 2 percentage points higher than BPM. In terms of operating efficiency, our cost/income ratio is 13 percentage points lower. Our RoAC is 14 percentage points higher. UniCredit trades at a significant discount to BPM on 2026 consensus price to earnings and even more so on price to distribution. Given the strengths of our organization and our confidence in our preparedness to face the future, we believe it should be otherwise. Commerzbank. While today Commerzbank is just an investment and there is no offer on the table, an in-market combination with HVB would create the #2 private bank in the country with minimal overlap in key regions and clients. The combined entity would be larger and more stable operating under the German law, protected by German deposit insurance and run day-to-day with decisions made in Germany for Germany. The 2 banks would almost equally contribute to reaching a low teens market share in the Mittelstand. All its clients could benefit from access to UniCredit's higher quality product and services as well as its 13 markets in Europe, where we hold leading presences, superior capital positioning and balance sheet strengths and lower cost of funding, the impact of higher better targeted investment capacity, particularly in technology, data and network. Poland would benefit from being fully empowered, but also capable to leverage the #1 CEE franchise, a much stronger bank in Germany and leading franchises in Italy and Austria. It too would be able to access our product factories and much needed investment in its technology. Commerzbank's people will have better opportunity as part of a wider group. UniCredit will continue to engage constructively with employee representatives and efficiencies will have a limited impact on the network. This deal would be a circa \u20ac20 billion vote of confidence on Germany, on the German banking system, on the European banking system and on Europe. It is a sign of belief in the potential of our banking industry and ability to compete against foreign and fintech competitors that are gaining significant share. There is a massive performance gap between the 2 banks today, despite them being the mirror image of each other in Germany. Herein lies both the size and the credibility of a value creation opportunity even before considering any synergy. HVB is #1 for profitability, operational and capital efficiency in Germany. Our capital efficiency, net revenue RWA is 2 percentage points higher than Commerzbank. Our cost efficiency, cost-to-income ratio is 18 percentage points lower. Our RoAC is 11 percentage points higher. This gap is likely to widen in our opinion. HVB's top line will continue to benefit from our focus on profitability rather than volume and is now ready to grow in a quality way without the headwinds of cleaning up the past. HVB will further leverage best-in-class operational and capital excellence, together with the impact of past investment and future one in technology and data. Conversely, we believe Commerzbank will both need to do the hard work, temporarily affecting the result of the next 3 years and be credible in its execution, given the midst of the last 2 efficiency plans. Regarding any potential target, we would look to understand. Number one, efficiency has past cost management focused solely on reducing expenses without reinvestment to the detriment of strengthening the organization? Is any catch-up now needed at a particularly more difficult time? Are efficiencies supported by changes in the organization, processes, way of working, model, automation or is the target overstretching the organization? Secondly, investment. Has the bank adequately invested in its network, people, technology, data? If not, is there a plan to catch up? And how will that be funded? Preparedness, is the bank able to sustain the turn in the macro environment as the sector is exposed to rates and cost of risk normalization and inflationary pressure on cost? How robust is the starting point in terms of NPE coverage, overlays, NII profitability and approach to lending? On Commerzbank, we're looking for clarity on the following, corporate Center, representing almost half of the bank on which limited information is ever provided. The opaque nature of this structure raises question on transparency, risk, volatility and the true efficiency and profitability of the core business. Technology and data, what is the state of technology and data system, especially obsolescence and level of integration of past acquisition, in particular Dresdner? Are future investments sufficient to maintain an efficient IT, supporting its people and the business. Strategic plan and execution credibility of a new target realistic, particularly given failure to achieve some of the previous one inefficiency. Or do they rely on overly optimistic assumption and the pressure to counter a potential offer? Are they overly focused on volume and dropping margin? Are sufficient steps taken to structurally improve efficiency, core banking earnings and reduce volatility? Given the time line we look at today, we will have 3, 4 or even 5 full quarter to observe execution. We look forward to more clarity on all of these points. In closing, and before I open up for questions, I would like to leave you with our key messages. One, UniCredit delivered 16 consecutive quarter of profitable growth, reaching its best year ever. Two, we are now transformed into Europe's best-performing and rewarding bank given our distributions. Three, we are entering in the next phase of our winning strategy from a position of strength and intend to widen the gap with our competitors. Four, we have an exciting organic growth and distribution story ahead. As of now, the most generous. Five, M&A will act as a further accelerated and will be executed only within our strict metrics or not at all. Overall, UniCredit remains a unique investment proposition still accessible at an attractive valuation, as our team in Bulgaria loves to remind me, the best is yet to come. Thank you, and we're now open to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Britta Schmidt of Autonomous Research.\nBritta Schmidt: With regards to the Commerzbank stake, you say you've got 3 to 5 full quarters of observing how Commerzbank will execute, whatever they are going to announce. But do you have a fixed plan as to what you consider doing after these 5 quarters in terms of divestment or continuing to hold it as a financial investment? And another question I have is just regarding the RWA guidance to \u20ac300 billion in 2025. Can you help us break down the drivers a little bit? We've got the Basel IV impact. But what are the other moving parts, considering that this is above consensus expectations?\nAndrea Orcel: Okay. I'll take Commerzbank. So obviously, the reason we have 3 or 4 quarters is because we are sticking by what we said, and we are waiting to be able to engage with a new government before we do anything else on Commerzbank such as launching a bid. If you go through the time line, that takes you through 3, 4, 5 quarters, depending what you assume. I also highlight to everybody that if and when we were to launch a bid, the decision remains firmly with us, and we would launch a bid when we are ready, not in automatic following of whatever we do -- we achieve in terms of negotiation with the government. So that is why the time line. In terms of the maximum time and what we do next, it will very much depend on the outcome of all of these conversations and discussions. So at the moment, I cannot tell you.\nStefano Porro: So in relation to risk-weighted asset guidance, so let's start from starting point, \u20ac277 billion. Q1, we have Basel impact. So the Basel impact is in basis points, 80 basis points in terms of risk-weighted asset number will be between \u20ac14 billion and \u20ac15 billion. The Basel impact on the full year, taking consideration the mitigating actions that we will perform during the course of the year, will be around \u20ac12 billion. So that's the reason why the full year impact is around 60 basis points of common equity tier 1 ratio. Then we have model changes during the course of 2025 are primarily related to multinational clients and [indiscernible] model locally from an overall amount of around \u20ac8 billion during the course of primarily first half of 2025. Important to take into consideration that we will keep on doing active portfolio management action during the course of the year, In '24, we have done around \u20ac13 billion. In '25, we will do more than \u20ac7 billion of active portfolio management action, including also securitization. The business dynamic will be driven by the lending volumes that are expected to be higher than 2024, with a growth rate that will be, let's say, in line with the GDP expectation for 2025.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrea Filtri of Mediobanca.\nAndrea Filtri: The first is on distribution. You guide for organic distributions over \u20ac9 billion each of the next 3 years and net profit ambition going towards \u20ac10 billion with distributions close to net profit, while also targeting \u20ac6.5 billion excess capital redistribution by 2027 after M&A. Keeping the math simple, can we therefore dream of over \u20ac30 billion cumulative 2025-'27 distribution? And this is on a stand-alone basis, while you have more than one M&A front open. So how should we look at your 2025 targets? How do they change? If you would be successful on the BPM offer? And how should we consolidate the Commerzbank stake in 2025? Second question is on Russia. You're providing 2025 target and saying you are compliant with ECB order. Can we therefore, consider the credit being forced to sell Russia at \u20ac1 as an unlikely event? And finally, if you could just provide the off-balance sheet DTAs remaining.\nAndrea Orcel: Okay. All right. So I like to dream, but you have a calculator, you can get to your own numbers. What I can tell you is that we have just committed to pay in excess of \u20ac9 billion per year for 3 years. And we confirm that we are returning the entire $6.5 billion of excess capital by '27. That's also within 3 years. I think it's a little bit more than a dream. Let's put it this way. The second thing is, yes, this is the base case. So as you can say, and I underscore that, because given the excitement that M&A brings everybody tends to deviate. And I remind everybody that everybody tended to deviate the first day I got here. And I think you would agree that not doing M&A got us quite far. This is the same for the next 3 years. The difference is that we now have 2 possibilities on the table, but there is no way that we will risk derailing what we feel is an exciting plan that combines profitable growth higher than most of our peers and distribution definitely higher than most of our peers to do M&A at the wrong terms or in the wrong way or at the wrong price. So this is the premise, and I want to make it clear. So that then brings you to your question, well, if you do M&A, what happens to our distribution, et cetera. At the moment, I can only give you what I have for certain. So first, 2024 distribution will be done, meaning they will be done just after the M&A complete, one way or the other, because we have committed to them. So what remains to be done in terms of dividend will be done slightly before. What remains to be done in terms of share buyback will be done later because we cannot interfere with our share price during the offer period. Secondly, if we were to do M&A, what is the impact on 2025 distributions in general, okay? So that's the second question. So if we were able to complete BPM, what would happen? My view, nothing would happen, meaning the 2020 -- we have said that we will strive to maintain the dividend per share equal for our shareholders, and that will happen. Secondly, all the planned distribution to shareholders will continue as if the acquisition has not occurred. What you will have is a dilution of your excess capital at the tail of 2027, right? Because we're using some of it, we would be using some of it to do the transaction. But by the time you get to 2027, we are -- we would have fully integrated the bank. It would be more than halfway through getting to the level of performance that we are, and it would positively contribute to our distribution on an organic, recurrent, ordinary fashion. So it's accretive, and that's exactly what we have said we would do. I am not going to speculate on Commerzbank because it's not on the table. And if you think about it, Andrea, if you believe, and I let you decide 3 quarters, 4 quarters, assuming it goes ahead, after that, you should add 9 months. It takes you very quickly into '27. So I know a lot of people are speculating about that, but most of our plan is going to be done without any impact from that. The second thing that I would say is even if we consolidated the stake in '25 because we get authorization to reach the 30% physical shares, but consolidation will only very mildly affect our CET1 ratio, given that it would remain to be hedged. And therefore, the distribution would not be affected by that in the least, okay? The other thing, Russia, let me remember what we said. So I cannot speculate on what may happen or not happen. But you do know the way we have managed the situation, finding the right balance between doing what we felt is right, morally correct and defending the interest of our shareholders and incidentally of our people. We will continue to do so. And therefore, as far as we are concerned, your selling for \u20ac1, et cetera. If it's me, unless I'm forced, I will not be selling Russia for \u20ac1 or for anything that is not a \"fair price.\" At the moment, I remind you, we have a bank that has less than \u20ac1 billion in deposits, less than \u20ac1 billion in loans. That is probably a payment reference in corporate, but all within the sanction framework and increasingly under the ECB order, and that focused on euro and U.S. dollar and which is primarily targeted to serving Western clients that still are operating in the country. The retail is being reduced to 0, and this is what we have. Where we go from there will depend on a number of other scenarios, but selling for 0 is not in the card. I also would like to highlight that Russia becomes quite marginal in our numbers. One of the reason why we grow in \"only\" to \u20ac10 billion in net profit is because we absorb the entire contribution for Russia during the period. So we are assuming that the contribution will trend to 0 by '27.\nStefano Porro: So in relation to the capital impact of the Commerzbank stake is the overall exposure is currently impacting the capital of around 10 basis points. If we will move from an equity position, so with shares from 9 to 29 as highlighted by Andrea, during the course of '25, in such a case, the impact will be around 30 basis points of common equity tier 1 ratio, so well within the capital buffer that we have. In relation to the DTA, so we have in-balance sheet DTA in relation to Italian perimeter for \u20ac4 billion. There is nothing more that we can recognize in Italy. That means that from this moment onwards, it's not a P&L topic. It's a capital topic. So when we will utilize these DTAs, we will generate capital. By when we will do that? We will do that in the course of the next 6 years, which is the overall capital benefit from this is around 140 basis points of capital. In relation to the off-balance sheet DTAs that we can further writing up is around \u20ac400 million pertaining to the Austrian perimeter. And we might do the writeup, let's say, already during the course of '25, provided that the profitability will bring us to such a conclusion.\nOperator: The next question is from Antonio Reale of Bank of America.\nAntonio Reale: It's Antonio from Bank of America. I have 2 questions, please. One on strategy and one on your mid-term profit aspirations. On the first question, since you've joined UniCredit, you've launched a number of initiatives to grow back into your product factories. We've seen it in payments, life insurance and a number of others. So I've seen increasingly this trend in Italy. There's been, I think, a shift in focus and attention towards preserving Italian savings. And you've often talked about UniCredit when it comes to asset management being a distributor of AUM products rather than a manufacturer. So I wonder if your strategy or vision about this with respect to asset management, in particular, has changed in any way? That's my first question. Maybe I can complement that or you can complement the answer by also sharing your views on insurance and why you've decided to cross the 5% stake in Generali ahead of their Board renewal in May. And you've partly answered the second question, which is around your profit aspirations. I think you have clear stand-alone targets, and people will give you credit on delivery. You talked about your vision for UniCredit to become the Bank of Europe's future, which is a project that's taking shape as we speak it's becoming more and more tangible at least versus when you first talked about it. So my question is why not put a number on this vision and aspire to more than the \u20ac10 billion? That's my second question. I'll stop here.\nAndrea Orcel: I like the try on the more than \u20ac10 billion. So Antonio, let me start with the last one. If -- as I'm sure you have, if you did the numbers on the inertial impact, that we all tend to minimize of rich normalization, cost of risk increase, impact from inflation on cost on European banks, I think you would agree that the number is quite large. So for us, to add to that the additional compression to 0 of Russia and tell you that by '27 we are adding \u20ac700 million is, I would say, ambitious and realistic. That does not mean we can't do better, but it does mean that, at this point in time, based on all the uncertainty and the scenarios that we have, we put on the table what believe we can do and then we review if the scenarios improved. Not every bank scenario is as, let's say, demanding as ours in terms of the macro evolution. We believe it will have a very important impact. But what I believe we're not wrong is that whatever the scenario will be, we will do better. I am absolutely confident and determined to do that because of the strengths of the organization, of the reengineering of the organization, of lines of defense, of the clarity and granularity of each single action that every bank, every division, every person has and is executing. So I cannot control the environment. But on parity of environment, I am absolutely confident we will do better than everybody else. So for the time being, \u20ac10 billion stays because my best view of the macro environment is one that is quite conservative, and we will operate within that. With respect to -- and then, obviously, if we do M&A, the number moves. But for the time being, let's keep it there. If we do strategy since -- on the factories and savings, et cetera. Firstly, there is an important question out there that some of you or in particularly one person keeps on raising is whether the Danish compromise square is going to have a life or not. I remind everybody that for the time being, it's somewhere in purgatory, it hasn't been confirmed, okay? So as I said at the beginning of a plan, I did not believe into internalizing certain areas of insurance. But if a Danish compromise was going to be passed, we would. It was, we are. Let's see if a Danish compromise square is passed, and then let's review the position. That's number one. Number two, there is a big difference between what we're doing in insurance and what we would be doing in asset management. In insurance, we're processing unit linked and quite standardized and simple products for banks. In asset management, we do not believe we have the scale across products to compete with the leaders in the segment. I don't believe many people have. That does not mean we cannot have some, let's say, focused niches where we do internalize in full. We have that in our asset management company, primarily for Central and Eastern Europe, but now extensively more for the group in Croatia. We do have that in our project with Azimut. If you look at our capability to drive, differentiate on our brand, we've won markets, it speaks by itself. If we were to do an acquisition in Italy and that acquisition came with a factory in asset management, which is quite focused on certain standardized, simpler products that work well in Italy, that would complement that element of internalization. But by and large, if you look at the totality of our masses, the ability to have our own asset manager in-house for everything, I don't think is realistic. Honestly, I don't think it's realistic for any bank in Italy at least. So that, I think, is that. So I think it's a question of degrees. And I would also say that the control, if you want to call it this way, of savings remaining in Italy can be done if the distributor has a very strong position in all the contracts and in all the partnership and in all the way, it allocates those funds. This is what we have today, and therefore, I'm not concerned about that. Why cross 5% of Generali? I could tell you why not, but it's also -- I highlight. We do not only hold what we hold. As UniCredit, we also hold what our clients want to hold. And as a result of all the speculation, our clients are quite active. So I'm just telling you, together with our clients, we've crossed 5%. I mean, if you look at the magnitude of it, we've already spent a lot of time on it. The -- but what is important is that is not industrial. That is not aiming to buy or otherwise engage or whatever. It is a financial stake. It is in our investment portfolio. Because we bought it over several months, we have a significant capital gain. Part of it is hedged, as always. We -- they are a partner in Central and Eastern Europe and in other areas. And it is something that at this point in time makes sense. And for those of you, as I repeated that know me by now, we will not engage in adventures. We will engage in value creation, industrial projects and creating value for shareholders. And that should frame all the question on Generali.\nOperator: The next question is from Delphine Lee of JPMorgan.\nDelphine Lee: My first question is on Banco BPM. I just wanted to have a bit of an update of where you are in terms of your discussions? Would you expect coming back from the Italian government and how are your discussions progressing with CredAg. And then my second question is on your sort of net profit guidance and outlook, '25 and outer years. Just wondering if you wouldn't mind giving us a bit more color around net interest income within that and how much exactly headwind you have in mind, specifically also for '25, if you could clarify a comment around the moderate decline.\nAndrea Orcel: So on BPM, I think we are in the middle of a transaction or of an offer. And therefore, we are limited on what we can share. The transaction has -- or the offer has a time line. We are in the phase where we need to obtain authorization from regulators, from antitrust, golden power, et cetera. And therefore, we are in a situation of hold. There is nothing out of the ordinary into that process, and we are continuing along the time line. We have already set an indication for a potential EGM. It may move forward, backwards depending on the time to obtain those authorization. At the time being, it's our best guess. I -- personally, I think that the government or the leadership of the government was quite clear that they respect market and they respect -- they let it work, and that is what is happening at the moment. With respect to discussion with any non-shareholders, I remind you that we are in an offer, so we need to observe -- we can talk to them, but we need to observe pari-passu and treat them all the same. Credit Agricole is a partner of ours in asset management. It's a partner of ours in custody. It is a partner of ours in a number of places. We have talked to them and that is the extent for the time being. So as we get closer to the offer, maybe, there will be more discussion. But at this time, that is what it is. With respect to net profit, and then I'll pass to Stefan on NII in general, but, look, I think there are a lot of moving parts. In my opinion, if you go from an average Euribor of 3.6% and you dropped to 2.3% or could even drop to 2% or could even drop to 1.8%, for people to say that it will not have an impact on -- a material impact on your NII, particularly in countries where the pass-through has been low, is not realistic. We believe we will have most of our impact in NII will be concentrated in Italy. Hence, our attention to what people say because I do think that if Italy has a very low pass-through and benefit on the way up, just mathematically, it's going to be affected on the way down, okay? Other countries, take, for example, Germany and Austria have a pass-through all already in the 50s because they're, one, is mostly a corporate bank, et cetera. Obviously, they're going to be affected by the declining rate to a much lesser extent because they will manage the margin. And Central and Eastern Europe will grow. So in our profile, if I were to tell you about NII, Italy gets hit. The rest of the group supports and offset parts of that hit. And obviously, Stefan will look at that. But there is another thing that we're doing or we have been doing. I don't think people have picked that up enough is over the last 3, 4 years, when we say that our NII RoAC is highest profitability, it also means that we have cleaned up our underperforming exposures in terms of profitability. That means we don't need to clean them up again. That means that when you look at our growth of NII in the last 3, 4 years, it is net of the cleanup we did in our tank of past exposures, but were below the cost of equity. When we say that we grow with discipline, it means we are constraining growth because we only grow when it's above the cost of equity. So going forward, we will have some tailwinds from being in the right segments, in the right products, take consumer finance over mortgages and having completed this cleanup. Even so, we think it's going to have a very meaningful impact, which we're trying to compensate through fees, through cost, through cost of risk and then the balance below the line. But I'll leave it to Stefano go in detail on NII.\nStefano Porro: So let's start from the assumptions. So rates, average Euribor '24 was 3.6%; '25, we're assuming 2.3%. So it's more than 100 basis point reduction. Our net interest income sensitivity is around \u20ac300 million for impact to revenues for every 50 basis points, okay? So following the simple movement of the rates, we should have that impact. Then we have Russia. So we keep on reducing the exposure to Russia. But there is also an assumption in relation to the rate reduction in Russia. So we're expecting that the net interest income contribution from Russia to the group will be few hundreds million less in terms of net interest income. Then we have spreads and volumes. On the loan spread side, we are expecting to have an higher client spread, similar to what happened during the course of '24. This will happen also during the course of '25. Every basis point better is around \u20ac40 million better from net interest income standpoint. So this will be a mitigating factor. Volume-wise, as I was commenting before, we are expecting more loans, right? So this will also be a positive impact, whose effect will be more in '26 rather than '25. On the deposit side, the deposit pass-through will remain substantially flat. Clearly, the client rate will go down but as happened during the course of Q4, you saw that deposit volume went up. So we are also expecting that deposits will grow. So all in all, this will counter mitigate the effect they are having from the reduction of the markdown on the deposit. Finally, there is the replicating portfolio, the replicating portfolio contribution, so the hedging on the deposit was more than \u20ac450 million positive in '24. We are expecting that in '25, the contribution will not be meaningful. But if you look at the period '25, '27, the contribution to the net interest income will be positive, and it will be around \u20ac300 million. Last but not least, there is the change of perimeter. Watch out, the change of the perimeter because there is Alpha Romania. So Alpha Romania contributed for only \u20ac30 million to the net interest income of Q4, while the contribution for the full year will be clearly more than \u20ac100 million to the net interest income of the group.\nOperator: The next question is from Ignacio Ulargui of BNP Paribas Exane.\nIgnacio Ulargui: I just have one question on credit quality. If you could elaborate a bit on how do you see the credit quality evolving in your 3 key core markets and whether there is any sign of deterioration? How much of that partial usage of overlays would be beyond '25? And the second question, I mean, just looking to your cost-to-income ratio going forward, and then you have done an excellent job in terms of cost-to-income, how much lower can it go? I mean, do you think that the 30% is around the bottom? Or we could see further improvements on cost-to-income ratio?\nAndrea Orcel: So let me start with the cost side. So obviously, the cost-income ratio has 2 elements and in my revenues are compressing. There is a limit to where we can go. So we have set a target of 40%. 40% for '25, 40% for the plan that we have in the next 3 years. I remind you, we had 50% last time around when we did the first phase of UniCredit Unlocked. So to do 40% in a, let's say, more challenging top line environment, it means we need to continue improving cost. And we need to continue improving cost in an inflationary environment. So this is what we discussed at the beginning. Now is the time that we were waiting for everybody to cross because we have revenue being compressed and cost being driven up by inflation. And the jaws are coming together. On revenue, we'll discuss separately or we have on cost, partially be taking more than \u20ac3.5 billion of extraordinary charges in the last 3 years. We have prepared ourselves to be able to absorb the inflation and maybe grind slightly lower on similar perimeter, which means the enlarged perimeter at the moment with Romania, with Vodeno, with all of these is about \u20ac9.6 billion. We are aiming to hold, and that means absorbing all the inflation, the renegotiation of contract and everything else that is within that. So not an easy one. And for us, the cost of holding has already been taken. So it's not going to be below the line in the following years or it's going to be to a much lesser degree. So on that position, we think we are in a better position than almost anyone. With respect to the revenue line, obviously, we have all the offset that we have discussed, difficult in '25 because the compression of rates have an impact on our revenue concentrated in '25, then it loosens as we go through growth in '26 and '27. And the fees continue to grow into '25, '26, '27. So the revenue line will become more of an advantage once we trough in 2025. So 2025 is the difficult time. On asset quality, what I would say is, while we're cautious because I've never seen a cycle where cost of risk does not go up. At the moment, we don't have significant indication of worsening. Yes, we have a fall here and a fall there. But when I look at the numbers, they're really quite minor. I remind you that we had the first 3 quarters with a cost of risk almost in the single digits. And we, again, were conserving by, let's pay -- let's say, being over conservative in the force by creating specific provisions, we couldn't build more our overlays to make sure that whatever happens in the next 3 years, we are prepared. And therefore, the cost of risk of the last quarter is up, but it's not up because, Oh, my God, the asset quality is degenerating. It's up because of one position, but most importantly, because we are further strengthening our provisions. And so in '25, it depends the use of overlays, it depends what you assume. If you assume that the cost of risk jumps for the industry or for us, 25, 30, 35, then you can calculate how much overlays we're going to release on top. if you don't assume that, then we're not going to use any overlays. But the overlays are there to be used. And I remind everybody in doing your numbers, if -- as we are expecting the cost of risk trends up materially, they will be used to keep it below 25 -- 20 to 25 basis points. Actually, now, we assume even lower because we've given you 15. If the cost of risk does not increase, as many people -- some people are assuming, then the overlays are going to be released over the next 3 years. And we are going to become a net propeller of our bottom line as we get released. We can't keep them there forever.\nStefano Porro: So I can give you some data points more, just to add. So if you look 2024, the cost of risk of the group was 15. Then if you look the different countries, we were at around 30 basis points in Italy, 20 in Germany. Austria was single digit, was 7. But Central Europe was having a negative cost of risk for -- I mean, Eastern Europe, specifically for around minus 5. Why? Because we had a lot of write-backs. The situation will change, right? Because while we will see very likely a similar cost of risk for Italy probably something less for Germany, in the case of Eastern Europe, we will go back to normal, right? So we will go back to a positive cost of risk. Commenting on the default rates. So as highlighted by Andrea, in '24, the default rate of the group portfolio was 1.3%. But then if we're adjusting for a few big tickets, the overall portfolio had a default rate of 1%. That was fundamentally the same that we experienced in '22 and in '23. So fundamentally, there is stability in relation to that. And in '24, both Germany and Austria, just for these few big tickets were below 1%. So we were respectively 0.7% and 0.9%. So what we are currently assuming for the future is, let's say, a trend of the default rate that will not be significantly different from what we had in 2024. Slightly worse, but not meaningfully worse than this.\nOperator: The next question is from Giovanni Razzoli of Deutsche Bank.\nGiovanni Razzoli: I have 2 questions. The first one is on your profitability target. You have increased the bar, targeting a return on tangible equity that is now above 17%. Shall I take this that this new level of profitability also as a bar for the threshold to proceed with M&A? Because if I'm not mistaken, to my memory, you said in the past that you never have executed any deal with a return on investment capital below 15%. So I'm wondering whether with increased profitability on a stand-alone basis, this 15% has now increased to 17%. And the second question is on your Generali investment. Clearly, this is a financial investment, but you are now one of the 4 largest shareholder of the group. And as such, I would like to share -- if you can share with us your views on the recently announced deal that Generali and with [Natixis], what are your views there? Are you supporting it? Or do you see some risk on that?\nAndrea Orcel: So profitability and M&A, what we said is that, number one, M&A needs to compare favorably with buying back our own shares and which, by the way, at this point in time, we're buying back at a premium to book, not at book. And secondly, we've often mentioned a return on investment of 15%. We also said that it's rate dependent, and it's country-dependent. But on average, it is correct. What do I mean by that? I mean that if rates go to -- if rates were at 4% and now they are 2%, I need to also not be unrealistic. But as of now, I would say that our commitment that if you do your projection on, I don't know, buying back x billions of our shares at current market prices versus M&A, we should be -- the -- I should be able to argue to you that M&A is better or not do it at all. I think it's the easiest way because [Natixis] Capital and myself are going to go in 1 of 2 directions, buy back my shares or buy the shares of another bank and bring in their earnings. If that does not compare favorably, I shouldn't be doing it, okay? Then we can discuss whether it is immediately on the year 1 or within the first 1.5 to 2 years, but that is the point. So that will not change. And it is our bar, and this is what we committed to investors, and we're not changing. On Generali, I know everybody makes a big deal out of it. I am not going to comment on a deal of another company. Let's say that, at this point in time, we are -- we made an investment. We know it has significance, but we are so focused on executing our Q1 and the 2 transactions that potentially are on the table that we don't spend much time on that. At the appropriate time, we'll make a decision.\nOperator: The next question is from Hugo Cruz of KBW.\nHugo Cruz: Just a question on NII sensitivity. Your sensitivity is for a parallel shift, it's more likely that you will see the short end come down but the middle and long end of the curve stay where they are. How would that scenario change your stated sensitivity?\nStefano Porro: Let's say, there is not a meaningful impact in case of a scenario in which there will be an impact also on the long-term part of the growth. As you have highlighted, the net interest sensitivity is calculated based on parallel shift, so plus 50. Do consider that the main impact that they're having from the long part of the curve in our case is connected to the rolling of the replicating portfolios. We have a stock of \u20ac176 billion of hedging to the deposit and consider that every year, we are rolling between, let's say, \u20ac18 million and \u20ac20 billion. That is that you can derive, which is the sensitivity to the long-term part of the curve because when we do the rolling, we are hitting the long-term part of the curve. So 10 basis points, you multiply 10 basis points by \u20ac20 billion. So this is the impact that they're having, for example, for a reduction of 10 basis points in the long-term part of the curve.\nOperator: The next question is from Ignacio Cerezo of UBS.\nIgnacio Cerezo : The first one is on Commerzbank, asking you, if you have changed your mind about not going hostile on Commerzbank at any stage in the process? And given the recent language from both government and the company, what makes you think that they might be more open to negotiate at some point in the future? And the second question is more detail basically on the quarter, if you can break down the 15 basis points CET1 impact from the strategic investments in the fourth quarter?\nAndrea Orcel: Okay. So on Commerzbank, our position is unchanged. So we made the investment, we bought the shares from the government. We announced we would move to 29% or below 30% and ask authorization. We did that. When the position was made that we were not welcome, we said we would wait to engage with the government, and that is what we're doing. I don't have a position optimistic. However, I have a position of I do think the deal makes sense for all involved, and we will be waiting to present that position at the appropriate time in the future, and that is it. We are -- I personally, I'm optimistic that with fact in figures, it will be recognized. But for the time being, that's where we are. As we are where we are, and we have a stake, number one, as a shareholder, I am satisfied at the fact that the company is now shaking up things and trying to have a new plan and progress further. That's always positive. And hopefully that, that drives an improvement in their structural profitability, core structural profitability. And we can observe that over the time that is needed to talk to all interested party and see where we land. But that's not changed. So we are where we are. We'll see at the end of that what will happen, but I'm optimistic that with constructive conversation, you get to a positive outcome.\nStefano Porro: So in relation to the strategic investment impact of 15 basis points, is mainly deriving from the inclusion in the perimeter of Alpha Romania. So considering that the contribution is around \u20ac3 billion of loans, risk-weighted asset wise is \u20ac2.4 billion. So is explaining to you is around, let's say, 13, 14 basis points out of the 15. So it's a change of perimeter in relation to Romania.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Hallam of Goldman Sachs.\nChris Hallam: Just 2 quick questions left for me. On distribution, the \u20ac3.6 billion buyback in H2, does that approval process change at all? I guess, when you speak to ECB and present the capital plan for approval, there may be a change in perimeter and elevated operating and integration risks associated with that perimeter change. So how should we think about the risks or complexities of getting that \u20ac3.6 billion approved and executed in H2? And then secondly, on the \u20ac2 billion advisory and financing business, how do you see the growth outlook for that business in particular in 2025, maybe in the context of sort of ongoing trade and political uncertainty impacting businesses across the markets?\nAndrea Orcel: So the distribution, no, the processes are independent. I don't think that the potential acquisition of BPM affects the authorization on the share buyback, which is ongoing and exactly as all the others. The execution is not in fact affected by the ECB or regulators. It's affected by the correct orderly market -- maintenance of orderly market, which comes of the -- expects and buying back your own shares, while your shares are being offered for a transaction. It is not something that should be done. So depending on all the authorization, et cetera, we will execute the share buyback just after the transaction. If for any reason the transaction is delayed, we will execute as much of a share buyback that we can before the transaction is launched. So that -- and we remain committed to getting it done as quickly as possible. It's just a question that we will have a period within which we can't execute.\nStefano Porro: Yes. on the advisory and financing fee growth rate, it's not different from the other categories when we're looking above '27 versus '24 and '25 versus '24. However, when we're looking to 2025, especially in relation to the German related activity is worthwhile to highlight the expectation. So the pipeline is not bad, but clearly, there is uncertainty also connected to election and to the overall evolution of the economy. So all in all, apart from consideration related to the market volatility -- to the financial market volatility, we are expecting acceleration of the growth in the second part of the year.\nOperator: Gentlemen, there are no more questions registered at this time. Back to you for any closing remarks you may have.\nAndrea Orcel: Thank you, everyone, for your patience, and we'll see many of you during the road show. Thank you.",

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Good morning. It is my privilege to present the successful completion of the first phase of UniCredit Unlocked crowned by our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results. We're now moving to the second phase of UniCredit Unlocked, Acceleration. This will include our expectations and levers for the next 3 years, the guidance outlook and inorganic activity. Our performance would not be possible without the continued support of all our stakeholders. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our clients for their trust, our shareholders for their belief and unwavering support and, above all, the people of UniCredit whose passion, dedication and hard work make UniCredit what it is. I will start directly with Slide 5, as I speak to all points in Slide 3 and 4 later. UniCredit's transformation from '21 to '24 has been nothing short of exceptional, particularly as it has also consistently delivered outstanding financial results quarter after quarter, while setting a new benchmark for banking. We have unified and refocused the entire organization around a single vision, strategy and culture. We have simplified and streamlined our organization, processes and way of working. We have restored trust and empowerment among our 13 banks and our employees, all coming together as one group. By leveraging our scale, we have put to common denominator our product factories, building an ecosystem of partners. We have put our technology and data under one cohesive framework, driving efficiencies and innovation. These action have been taken putting our client always at the center and have not only transformed UniCredit into a stronger, more competitive institution with leading financial KPIs, but also set us on a trajectory of continued success in the future. While the emphasis shall now shift, our transformation is far from over. We have surpassed all our targets. While macro tailwinds have favored our results in some areas, they have also masked the extent of our achievement. Our 14% net revenue growth was achieved with discipline. NII RoAC increased from 4% to 19% and is now best in the industry. Fees grew 6%, ahead of our peers to 33% of total revenues. The impact of our investment in our factories has just started to show. Despite inflationary pressures, particularly significant in our perimeter, we reduced cost by around \u20ac1.7 billion, while reinvesting circa \u20ac1.4 billion to strengthen our group. Our cost-to-income ratio declined further to 37.9%, despite our complexity, beating peers by a significant margin. Capital efficiency move from laggard to leader, supporting \u20ac26 billion of distribution, 65% more than the original \u20ac16 billion target, while building an excess capital chest of \u20ac6.5 billion, taking \u20ac3.6 billion of integration cost in the period and \u20ac700 million of additional overlays. This excess capital shall now either boost our '25, '27 distribution or provide us with strategic flexibility. Our net profit is more than double what we planned in 2021, no matter which definition you take. Our return on tangible equity is also more than double the UniCredit Unlock target, despite the building of our excess capital. This performance balances, excelling in the short term and preparing for the future. It is a testament to the dependability of UniCredit and its people. UniCredit now consistently delivers quality profitable growth. We have generated positive jaws across all our key metrics. Our revenues have grown while focusing on profitability, rather than volume in our chosen client segments. We not only reduced absolute cost in the face of inflation, but did so while investing for our future and increasing our top line. UniCredit remains a leader in the industry across all KPIs. We begin the next phase of our journey from a position of significant strength. We delivered total shareholder return of 513%, 4x our European peers. We delivered the best share price performance despite derating. We delivered the most generous distribution, whilst building our excess capital. We are strong and able to offset the normalization of macro. We intend to grow our net profit at a high-teens return on tangible equity, delivering the highest sustainable distribution of the peer group. The trajectory ahead for our shareholders remains bright. Let's now focus on our Q4 and full year results in detail. Given the different definition of net profit used by our competitor, let me share ours under the different views. Our stated net profit exceeded \u20ac9.7 billion for the full year. Our net profit, excluding DTAs, is now well ahead of the \u20ac9 billion we guided to, reaching \u20ac9.3 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Both are after absorbing \u20ac1.3 billion in integration costs and legal provision for Russia, without which our beat would have been much greater and with which we further derisk 2025 and beyond. Our underlying net profit without integration cost and the extra legal provision for Russia reached \u20ac10.3 billion, a very strong base. These outstanding bottom line results have been achieved, thanks to strong performance across every single line of our P&L and balance sheet. Net revenue increased 4% to \u20ac24.2 billion in the year, remaining flat in the quarter and up 1.3% if adjusted for the Commerzbank hedge one-off. This is a result of strong profitable NII and fees and low and stable LLPs. Trading profit for the full year would have increased, excluding the one-off impact of the Commerzbank hedge. NII grew on a quarterly and yearly basis, despite the recent decline in rates due to excellent management of the pass-through and our replicating portfolio and investment portfolio results. In the fourth quarter, we also benefited from a \u20ac3 million -- \u20ac30 million contribution from the consolidation of Alpha Bank Romania and a \u20ac50 million one-off in Italy. Our NII remains highly profitable with a RoAC of circa 19%, thanks to our continued focus on our target client segments and product and profitability over volume. Our asset quality remained strong and stable with a gross NPE ratio of 2.6% and a net NPE ratio of 1.4%. Our gross NPE stock is half what it was 4 years ago. Our cost of risk remains structurally low at 15 basis points for the year and 34 basis points for the quarter, including an increase in our specific provision with overlays untouched at \u20ac1.7 billion. We're still benefiting from write-backs confirming quality origination and conservative provisioning. The overall cost of risk is flat year-on-year with a default rate of 1.3% and only 1%, flat versus fourth quarter '23, excluding a single NIM one-off in the fourth quarter. Fee growth has been strong across all categories, accelerating this year and even more so in the quarter, up 9% year-over-year. Our fee to revenue ratio stands at a top-tier 33%, notwithstanding strong quality NII growth, highlighting the quality and diversification of our fee base. Overall fee performance has been driven by continued strong momentum in investment and P&C insurance with growth at 17%, driven by increased client appetite, a broader product offering and our ongoing shift towards affluent and private clients. Strong fee growth will remain central to our future success, fueling capital-light revenues and delivering exceptional results to clients and shareholders. This will allow us to extract positive differential value from any partnership or acquisition that we may make. Over the last 3 years, we have consistently reduced our absolute cost base offsetting inflation while investing in the business. In '24, we further reduced our cost by 0.6%, driven by non-HR down 1.3% and HR cost down 0.1%, despite increasing the remuneration of our people. This quarter, costs were impacted by bonus pool, 2 months of Alpha Romania consolidations and accelerated digital investments. Without this intentional investment, costs would be flat in the quarter and lower still in the year. Our cost/income ratio improved to 37.9%, consistently leading our peer group. From disciplined cost management, combined with target streamlining of our organization, reducing unnecessary overhead and investing efficiency. Our operational excellence has been a key factor in our success, and we intend to maintain it and defend it. Our best-in-class organic capital generation of \u20ac12.6 billion for the year allowed us to absorb headwinds, increased distribution to \u20ac9 billion and maintain a stable CET1 ratio of 15.9%. Active portfolio management reduced RWAs by almost \u20ac13 billion. We now present our region in a way that we believe better represent very individual dynamic. We will separate Italy from Germany, from Austria and pull together Central and Eastern Europe. So let's start with Italy. Our franchise in Italy is market-leading in terms of profitability, efficiency and capital generation by a wide margin. It is UniCredit's quality earnings powerhouse, and its results speak for themselves. Gross revenues grew 4% to \u20ac11.4 billion, driven by both NII, plus 5% and very strong fees, plus 7%. We continue to focus on profitability rather than volume. NII RoAC exceeded 23%, significantly above our peers. All 3 categories grew, with investment and insurance delivering a standout performance of plus 16% and fees to revenue reaching almost 40%. We're leading in terms of our investment products growth in Italy. Operational efficiency improved further. Costs were down despite growth and investment in technology and our people, allowing us to reach a cost/income ratio of 34.5%, unparalleled in the country. Capital efficiency improved yet again with net revenues over RWAs of 10.5%. Net profit rose 10% to \u20ac4.4 billion. RoAC reached 31%, the best in Italy. As a result, organic capital generation reached \u20ac5.5 billion, again, well in excess of our net profit, underscoring the quality and profitability of our growth. This outstanding performance provides the firepower to constantly deliver innovative solution and support for our client. This year alone, we facilitate almost \u20ac11 billion in financing to support Italian SMEs, none of which would be possible without our people. We welcomed over 1,000 new team members this year and launched professional retraining and upskilling initiatives, delivering 1.3 million hours through UniCredit University. Germany. Our German bank is the most profitable and efficient in the country with the best balance between gross and profitable NII and quality fees. One of our two key anchors for the group, it delivered its highest profit ever. This is the financial result of our successful transformation. Gross revenue grew 1% to \u20ac5.5 billion, driven by fees, up 3% to \u20ac1.6 billion, accelerating plus 8% in the quarter. Fees compensated NII, down 3.5% in the quarter, while maintaining the leading NII RoAC in the country, above 18%. Operational efficiency improved yet again. Costs were down 8%, despite growth and investment in technology and people. Cost income declined to below 41%. Capital efficiency improved yet again with net revenues over RWAs of 7.5%. Net profit rose 12% to \u20ac1.9 billion. RoAC reached 20%. As a result, organic capital generation reached \u20ac2.8 billion, well in excess of net profit. Our disciplined approach to profitable growth stands out. We have restrained ourselves from chasing some competitors who have recently significantly reduced pricing to inflate revenue, which are well below the cost of equity and will impact the profitability over time. This success is thanks to the caliber of people who make our business. In the last year, we hired more than 300 new colleagues and announced the creation of over 140 new jobs as part of our integration of a custody business. We have been awarded Top Employee Germany for the 15th time in a row. Our team is united behind a common vision and ambition and in a market-leading position from which now accelerate. Austria. Our bank in Austria is the most profitable and efficient bank in the country. The second anchor to our group, it continues its transformation, showing improvements on every line and delivering its best net profit ever. Gross revenues grew 3% to \u20ac2.7 billion, driven by fees, up 8% due to strong investment and client hedging fees and resilient NII, plus 2%. We are maintaining discipline as competitor chase volumes, reflected in our NII RoAC of 15%, well ahead of all peers. Operational efficiency improved yet again. Costs were down more than 1%, despite growth and investment in technology and in people. Our cost-to-income ratio declined below 38%. Capital efficiency improved yet again with net revenues over RWAs of 7%. Net profit rose 14% to \u20ac1.3 billion. RoAC reached 24%. As a result, organic capital generation reached \u20ac1.5 billion, again, in excess of our net profit. We supported the growth of our SMEs through the provision of \u20ac3.4 billion in new lending and rolled out a digital credit decision engine to provide SMEs faster access to it. We kept a strong focus on supporting our customers, employees and communities, launching a special tranche of mortgage loans with favorable conditions for young families. And under the umbrella of UniCredit University Austria, we continued expanding our development and upskilling program, while our new well-being framework reached more than 1,000 people. Central and Eastern Europe. Our Central and Eastern Europe franchise also leads in profitability and efficiency. It is the growth engine of our group. It demonstrated excellent performance as our local countries lead in their own right in their individual markets, whilst leveraging benefits from our group-wide factories, network and platforms. Gross revenues grew 8% to \u20ac4.5 billion driven by fees, plus 13% and resilient NII, plus 5% with an NII RoAC of 26%. We're maintaining discipline without sacrificing market share as competitors chase volumes. Operational efficiency improved yet again with cost income at 33%, whilst capital efficiency remained high with net revenue over RWAs at 8.7%. Net profit rose 3% to \u20ac2.2 billion. RoAC reached 30%. Organic capital generation reached \u20ac1.6 billion. I would like to underscore that Central and Eastern Europe, underlying growth is twice that of the core European Union with low FX risk. We have unchallenged leadership in corporate and a significantly growing retail contribution, which should further be enhanced by our reentry in Poland, leveraging Vodeno-Aion. 4 banks contribute 70% of our region's revenue. In Bulgaria and Croatia, we have a leadership position in both retail and corporates. In Romania, we are top tier. And in Romania and Czech and Slovakia, we lead in corporate. We are complementing and accelerated by our other 5 banks, which, while smaller, deliver outstanding performance. This year alone, we upskilled 900 branch managers, set up bespoke initiative to recognize and nurture talent within our Gen Z cohort. We continued with our dedicated development to build a solid pipeline of future managers. Russia. We have been working towards an accelerated orderly wind down of Russia from day 1. Always, within both the letter and the spirit of a complex legal, regulatory and sanctioned limitation. We met the target communicated in H1, 1 year early. Local deposits declined to \u20ac900 million, 89% down since first quarter '22. Net local loans declined to \u20ac1 billion, 86% down since first quarter '22. Cross-border exposure declined 94% to date and will become practically nil this year. We minimized our loss to only 11% of principal. Cross-border payment are below $10 billion, 64% down since Q1 '22. We are now almost exclusively in Europe and U.S. dollar. We have reduced the capital impact of a full write-down of Russia from circa 130 basis points on a 14% CET1 in Q1 2022 to now circa 50 basis points, 10 basis points lower than recently on a 16% CET1 today. We are now compliant with this ECB order. Turning to our product factories. We see strong delivery of our sustainable capital-light fee-based revenue. Client Solutions revenue grew by 9% to \u20ac11.3 billion, 2/3 are fees, up 8%. Individual Solutions rose by 14% to \u20ac3.3 billion, driven by investments, up 18% and protection up 13%. We're increasing the use of our market products within our investment offering to create better solutions for our clients. Our onemarket funds reached \u20ac14.5 billion, and our own Managed Funds gross to total sales reached 31%, up from 14% in 2023. Corporate Solutions revenue rose by 9% to \u20ac5.4 billion, driven by client risk management up 17% and advisory and financing, up 6%. Payment Solutions rose 4% to \u20ac2.3 billion, driven by payment, up 7%. We are entering the next phase on UniCredit Unlocked, in which we focus on accelerating our top line, driven profitable growth. Our goal is to solidify our position as the leading Pan-European bank and further widen the gap versus competitors. The industry faces headwinds, such as net interest income pressure, cost inflation, normalization of risk, Russia and ongoing digital evolution. We are confident in our ability to complete our transformation while building on our unique structural advantages through targeted Alpha initiatives. This will allow us to not only overcome the impact of headwinds on our record net profit, but also grow it to over \u20ac10 billion, excluding DTAs, maintaining return on tangible in the high teens and our organic capital generation broadly in line with net profit. Structural advantages. Our road map is clear, we are a transformed bank, now harnessing its structural advantages, which are an attractive geographic footprint, combined with a quality client and product mix to deliver superior profitable growth and distribution over time. We operate as a federation of 13 individually empowered banks, each executing independently, yet benefiting from being part of one group. This profitable and diversified footprint, Italy's quality earnings anchored by Germany and Austria resilience and powered by our Central and Eastern European growth engine strikes the ideal balance between highly capital generative, stable markets and dynamically expanding one. We serve 15 million clients, with 60% of our revenues from high-value segments, such as SME, private and affluent, and we intend to increase that weight. By leveraging our global product offering, centralized procurement and technology and data infrastructure at scale will further enhance our competitive edge. This is how we drive our fee to revenue ratio towards 40%, outpacing market growth through internalization, superior fee and profitable lending products. No other peer is in such a favorable position. Alpha initiatives. To build on our structural strengths, our targeted Alpha initiatives are split into commercial and operational. Together, they support our ambition financial goals, ensuring we continue to build on our momentum and unlock new avenues of value creation. Turning to our geography. All regions will maintain strong performance throughout the plan. Italy, our powerhouse for quality earnings, will see its share of group net profit shift from 45% to around 40%. Having benefited most from rising rates, Italy will feel the impact of rate reversal more acutely, yet the quality of its earnings will continue to improve. Fees as a share of revenue will rise from circa 40% to 48%. NII RoAC will normalize at 17%, well ahead of cost of equity. The overall country RoAC will normalize at 25%. Germany and Austria, both high-rated economies, serve as resilient anchors for our group. They have benefited much less from the positive rates impact, hence, are now much more resilient on the way down. Combined with the continued improvements in their operational and capital efficiency and their readiness to now again gain profitable market share, Germany and Austria will bring their net profit contribution to 35% and RoAC to 22%. Finally, Central and Eastern Europe. Our proven engine of profitable growth will increase its contribution to about 20% -- 25% of net profit, despite a normalization of provision. Their growth should then accelerate from there. The region's operational and capital excellence will persist. Their cost/income ratio will further reduce to 31%, with RoAC reaching 30% and strong top line growth. This attractive diversified geographic mix will allow UniCredit to deliver superior profitable growth and capital generation, supporting outsized distribution. Building on the structural advantages, we will strategically increase allocated capital and investment across all regions. We will, however, prioritize those with the highest profitability and growth potential, with Central and Eastern Europe receiving the most but all regions growing. Our clients remain at the heart of our strategy. While we strive to add value to all, our growth initiative focus on targeting the most attractive segment with strong capital-light potential, we're decisively shifting our focus towards SMEs and private and affluent individuals, which currently account for 60% of our revenues and 75% of our fee growth going forward. We have built market-leading product factories that enable us to better serve our clients' diverse financial needs, a key competitive advantage. The impact that these factories are having on each one of our 13 franchise and now also on that of our partner in Greece demonstrate the significant value we can unlock not only internally, but in any acquisition. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in these factories and improve their connection to the end client, adding an additional \u20ac1.4 billion in fee growth by the end of our plan. Our ambition is to offer a truly integrated experience that blends digital innovation with personalized human interaction across both retail and corporate. This is done through the continued enhancement of our distribution model and channels, coupled with a team of motivated professional providing prompt, high-quality advice rooted in local expertise. Meanwhile, our digital channels are secure, user-friendly and increasingly capable of delivering an exceptional customer experience. Through our corporate portals, client receive personalized solution in the areas of transactional payments, trade finance, factoring, client risk management, regardless of their location. Our mobile channels provide on-the-go services tailored for digital-first lifestyles. By seamlessly integrating these channels, we can serve clients when, where and how they prefer 24/7, delivering bespoke outstanding survey and support at all times. Bringing it all together, by leveraging our attractive geographies, our factories and our channels, we will be able to become the go-to bank for our clients. While we have achieved strong NPS gains, our true priority lies in providing a distinctive experience that sets us completely at par from our peer group. We aspire to become the benchmark for quality when clients think about financial services. Our linchpin. Our people are the linchpin between our commercial and operating machine. They are the most valuable asset and what ultimately makes our ambition possible. We remain committed to investing in them. We believe that by empowering them, developing them, offering them clear career opportunities, they will achieve professional fulfillment. While not yet there, we are committed to continue on this path. We reward talent transparently. We have increased nonexecutive bonuses by 30% over the last 2 years, higher than those of executive. We offer the highest VAP in Italy, for example. In parallel, we aim to foster an inclusive, engaging culture by promoting employee-led initiatives, most of the 2,000 simplification initiatives we have rolled out came bottom up from our people and not top down. Our gender pay gap was 4% when we started the plan. We practically closed it today. Our ultimate goal is to create an environment in which our employees feel connected, valued and empowered because they are the driving force behind our continued success. Let's move to the Operating Machine, an organization and processes. Our operating machine has undergone a major overhaul to better support our business and create further value for our clients. We streamlined organizational structure, flattened the hierarchies and focused resources on high-impact areas, enabling our teams to act more swiftly. By eliminating inefficiencies, our cost base remained flat, whilst funding investment. We're increasingly leveraging technology and AI to automate and reduce complexity, improving our ways of working and redirecting savings towards business growth. And the results speak for themselves. Time to approval for a consumer loan in Italy dropped from over 24 hours to just 25 minutes, with more improvement on the way, and you will see them this year. We will continue to identify and remove inefficiency, accelerate automation and use of data, whilst treating every process, workflows and organizational structure as a blank slate for continuous improvement. Our digital strategy revolves around 2 core imperative. First, uncompromised reliability, security and compliance fully aligned with local and ECB regulation. Two, outcome-driven technology investment with every euro spent demonstrating that it can deliver a clear return and meet specific business organizational needs. Our ultimate ambition is to develop a digital foundation that not only meets but surpasses best-in-class peers and is able to compete with fintechs. Our IT spend is in line with or above our peers. That said, the efficiency of our spend has significantly improved, and we believe trends towards market-leading, allowing us to achieve more with less. With respect to technology and data, investing in the right initiative and with the lowest unit cost is far more important than the headline number of what one spends. Our security measures have become ever more effective, reflected in our reduction of incidents by 67% over 3 years. We have consolidated our data centers and reskilled our digital workforce, improving our tech to non-tech ratio by 18 percentage points. We maintain proactive oversight of regulatory requirement bolstered by a robust digital operational resilience strategy. We are now in a position to accelerate, leveraging technology, data and AI to elevate our performance to the next level. By continually experimenting to meet evolving needs, we're driving innovation and expanding our offering across multiple integrated platform and channel. You will increasingly see the outcome of that. Our ambition is to build our capacity to transform, evolving with a changing environment and the needs of our clients and ensuring we continue to provide outstanding products and services. To do so, we have and will continue to invest. We are planning to add \u20ac2.5 billion of IT investment over the plan, delivering IT projects at a lower unit cost and faster time to market, as a result of the disciplined focus on efficiency within our IT and AI spend. Vodeno-Aion. UniCredit's latest acquisition, Vodeno-Aion, is a proprietary technology and fintech solution that aligns perfectly with our acceleration. It combines all the aspects of our Alpha initiatives. Our initial pilots consist of reentering the Polish market, expanding in select Western and European countries and offering embedded finance solution. Thanks to Vodeno-Aion's high flexibility, extremely low cost to serve and quick time to market, we have the ambition to add 2.5 million clients and build the business with a meaningful impact on group net profit, a RoAC above 25% and a cost income ratio of 34% within 3 years. We plan to progressively invest up to \u20ac200 million on an iterative basis with a payback of under 2 years. Our guidance on cost already includes the maximum investment that we expect to make. In summary, our Alpha initiatives and our investment in Vodeno-Aion are at the base of our organic -- of our exciting organic growth story, a story that, together with the finalization of our transformation will allow us to absorb expected future headwinds in full and significantly grow without diluting profitability in our distributions. Similarly to Phase 1 of UniCredit Unlocked, we are again setting ambitious targets for Phase 2. Our ambition is to match 2024 record net profit in 2025, absorbing all headwinds and grow from there to circa \u20ac10 billion, excluding DTAs by 2027. We're determined to do so, maintaining a return on tangible equity in excess of 17% and an average '25, '27 organic capital generation broadly in line with our net profit. Together with the return of our excess capital, we aim to distribute more than in '24 in each of the next 3 years. 50% of net profit will be in cash. This would result in 6 years of improving performance and growth at an increasing margin over our cost of equity, coupled with best-in-class distribution. This should lead to a significant re-rating of our stock. We're excited about the challenge and determined to meet it. While we are realistic with respect to the challenges from a macro environment that will normalize, we believe that we are the best place to deliver the differential value and growth necessary to offset it and grow. We have built unique line of defense, including \u20ac1.7 billion of overlays to insulate us from the cost of risk cycle. We have front-loaded nonoperating items and extraordinary charges equal to \u20ac1.3 billion in 2024 alone, absorbing these within our beat of net profit and distribution. These should trend to 0 over the plan. Together with the strengths of our transformed group and our Alpha initiatives in flight, these lines of defense will derisk the achievement of our net profit ambition. Finally, we will have \u20ac6.5 billion excess capital to return to our shareholders by '27, which will further derisk our distribution. 2025 is the year of interest rate normalization, cost of risk trending up, inflationary pressure on cost and for us, further Russia compression. We expect NII to decline over mid-single digits, starting from a high base. This includes some loan growth for the group that is driven by Central and Eastern Europe. Our cost of risk should remain stable at around 15 basis points, including partial overlay usage. Fees and net insurance result should grow by more than 5%, as past investment increasingly deliver. As a reminder, in the second quarter, we expect to start reporting the insurance line as a separate line in our P&L. Trading high in '24 should reduce by a couple of hundred million, mainly due to the negative effect of lower rates on the funding of the trading book. The other revenue line should reduce by a couple of hundred million, as '24 benefited from some one-off and the contribution from insurance is reflected elsewhere. This leads to net revenue over \u20ac23 billion. Cost on the same perimeter would be slightly down. On the expanded perimeter, they will be around \u20ac9.6 billion with cost/income targeted at around 40%. Nonoperating and extraordinary item will significantly reduce, providing a large buffer to absorb any operating profit shortfall. This is protection of our results. Both stated net profit, including DTAs and net profit, excluding DTAs, are expected to be broadly in line with 2024. RWAs will increase to around \u20ac300 billion due to the impact of Basel IV models, changes and strategic investment, partly offset by further portfolio action. Basel IV impact will be around 80 basis points for the first quarter and 60 basis points for the full year, mostly from the standardization of operational risk models. Distributions are expected to be greater than in '24. We're confident we can continue to deliver strong EPS and DPS growth. Phase 2 of UniCredit Unlocked sees us shifting our focus on top line profitable growth while completing our transformation, aiming to maintain our leadership in operating and capital excellence, while investing in digital data and our people. We aim to achieve \u20ac10 billion of net profit, excluding DTA, by '27. Stated net profit and net profit should converge as DTAs should disappear. Hence, you should compare the \u20ac10 billion ambition with the \u20ac9.3 billion of today. We intend to distribute in each of the next 3 years more than '24, with 50% of net profit in cash. This is supported by a 17% return on tangible and average organic capital generation broadly in line with net profit and the return of our excess capital. We continue to target strong EPS and DPS growth. Our target CET1 currently remain between 12.5% and 13%, notwithstanding the impact of Basel IV and model changes, particularly on operational risk, not substantially changing our risk. We have just gone through Phase 2 of UniCredit Unlocked, which remains our main focus and a compelling base case that we believe will deliver positively differentiated performance and distribution versus our peers. Any M&A activity shall be executed solely if it further enhances our base case, solely if it further enhances our base case. It must be consistent with our strategy and meet our strict financial criteria, delivering returns that compare favorably to buying back our own shares. This is a high bar. We're not afraid to walk away, if not met and demonstrated this much so far. BPM. At the offer price, despite its valuation at a significant price earning and price to distribution premium to ours has enough potential to add value to meet our criteria. Commerzbank, still an investment, fully hedged on the downside. Our ability to add massive value to Commerzbank is demonstrated by HVB's transformation in only 3 years, but we would only make an offer at the right terms and conditions. There is no risk of overlap between these 2 potential deals as they would be sequential and would be led by separate local management teams in separate legal entities overseen by separate regulators. Just for transparency, we are about to announce that our total holding in Generali, including position that we hold on behalf of our client, has crossed the 5% threshold. This does not change our position on the stake, which remains financial and does not imply any interest to acquire the company of the like. A UniCredit-BPM combination would build a stronger #2 in Italy. Network and client franchise are complementary and would be highly protected. The combined client base of \u20ac12 million would be further tilted towards UniCredit's targeted segments, affluent, private and especially SMEs in which we do not expect any concentration issue, instead seeing significant growth potential. The combination allows BPM to access scale, benefiting from UniCredit's greater balance sheet, factories, superior investment firepower, particularly in the areas of technology, data and AI and the network. BPM clients would all benefit from a refurbished branch network and an improved branch network, integrated physical and digital channels, premium product factories, including consumer finance, asset management and insurance, superior capital and balance sheet strengths, meaning, improved lending capacity, access to UniCredit's Pan-European network. BPM's people would be offered better career development, opportunities and reward. Any cost efficiency will be made with limited impact on the network, as the efficiency will be focused on non-business overhead, back end of the bank and external providers. This approach was effectively delivered at UniCredit and in full cooperation with trade unions. Italy will benefit from the bank's enhanced ability to support local community, institutions and family. We offer a price that incorporated a 15% premium to BPM's undisturbed share price, the level prior to the announcement of the offer on Anima where 100% acquisition is not a forgone conclusion and further M&A speculation linked to a potential combination, one which is now off the table. We are offering all BPM's stakeholder an opportunity for strong certain and rewarding future. There is a clear performance gap between the 2 banks today. UniCredit Italy is the most profitable and efficient bank in the country by a wide margin. In terms of gross revenue growth, we outperformed BPM by 10 percentage points between '21 and '24 comparable 9 months period. In terms of capital efficiency, our net revenue to RWA is 2 percentage points higher than BPM. In terms of operating efficiency, our cost/income ratio is 13 percentage points lower. Our RoAC is 14 percentage points higher. UniCredit trades at a significant discount to BPM on 2026 consensus price to earnings and even more so on price to distribution. Given the strengths of our organization and our confidence in our preparedness to face the future, we believe it should be otherwise. Commerzbank. While today Commerzbank is just an investment and there is no offer on the table, an in-market combination with HVB would create the #2 private bank in the country with minimal overlap in key regions and clients. The combined entity would be larger and more stable operating under the German law, protected by German deposit insurance and run day-to-day with decisions made in Germany for Germany. The 2 banks would almost equally contribute to reaching a low teens market share in the Mittelstand. All its clients could benefit from access to UniCredit's higher quality product and services as well as its 13 markets in Europe, where we hold leading presences, superior capital positioning and balance sheet strengths and lower cost of funding, the impact of higher better targeted investment capacity, particularly in technology, data and network. Poland would benefit from being fully empowered, but also capable to leverage the #1 CEE franchise, a much stronger bank in Germany and leading franchises in Italy and Austria. It too would be able to access our product factories and much needed investment in its technology. Commerzbank's people will have better opportunity as part of a wider group. UniCredit will continue to engage constructively with employee representatives and efficiencies will have a limited impact on the network. This deal would be a circa \u20ac20 billion vote of confidence on Germany, on the German banking system, on the European banking system and on Europe. It is a sign of belief in the potential of our banking industry and ability to compete against foreign and fintech competitors that are gaining significant share. There is a massive performance gap between the 2 banks today, despite them being the mirror image of each other in Germany. Herein lies both the size and the credibility of a value creation opportunity even before considering any synergy. HVB is #1 for profitability, operational and capital efficiency in Germany. Our capital efficiency, net revenue RWA is 2 percentage points higher than Commerzbank. Our cost efficiency, cost-to-income ratio is 18 percentage points lower. Our RoAC is 11 percentage points higher. This gap is likely to widen in our opinion. HVB's top line will continue to benefit from our focus on profitability rather than volume and is now ready to grow in a quality way without the headwinds of cleaning up the past. HVB will further leverage best-in-class operational and capital excellence, together with the impact of past investment and future one in technology and data. Conversely, we believe Commerzbank will both need to do the hard work, temporarily affecting the result of the next 3 years and be credible in its execution, given the midst of the last 2 efficiency plans. Regarding any potential target, we would look to understand. Number one, efficiency has past cost management focused solely on reducing expenses without reinvestment to the detriment of strengthening the organization? Is any catch-up now needed at a particularly more difficult time? Are efficiencies supported by changes in the organization, processes, way of working, model, automation or is the target overstretching the organization? Secondly, investment. Has the bank adequately invested in its network, people, technology, data? If not, is there a plan to catch up? And how will that be funded? Preparedness, is the bank able to sustain the turn in the macro environment as the sector is exposed to rates and cost of risk normalization and inflationary pressure on cost? How robust is the starting point in terms of NPE coverage, overlays, NII profitability and approach to lending? On Commerzbank, we're looking for clarity on the following, corporate Center, representing almost half of the bank on which limited information is ever provided. The opaque nature of this structure raises question on transparency, risk, volatility and the true efficiency and profitability of the core business. Technology and data, what is the state of technology and data system, especially obsolescence and level of integration of past acquisition, in particular Dresdner? Are future investments sufficient to maintain an efficient IT, supporting its people and the business. Strategic plan and execution credibility of a new target realistic, particularly given failure to achieve some of the previous one inefficiency. Or do they rely on overly optimistic assumption and the pressure to counter a potential offer? Are they overly focused on volume and dropping margin? Are sufficient steps taken to structurally improve efficiency, core banking earnings and reduce volatility? Given the time line we look at today, we will have 3, 4 or even 5 full quarter to observe execution. We look forward to more clarity on all of these points. In closing, and before I open up for questions, I would like to leave you with our key messages. One, UniCredit delivered 16 consecutive quarter of profitable growth, reaching its best year ever. Two, we are now transformed into Europe's best-performing and rewarding bank given our distributions. Three, we are entering in the next phase of our winning strategy from a position of strength and intend to widen the gap with our competitors. Four, we have an exciting organic growth and distribution story ahead. As of now, the most generous. Five, M&A will act as a further accelerated and will be executed only within our strict metrics or not at all. Overall, UniCredit remains a unique investment proposition still accessible at an attractive valuation, as our team in Bulgaria loves to remind me, the best is yet to come. Thank you, and we're now open to questions."

But do you have a fixed plan as to what you consider doing after these 5 quarters in terms of divestment or continuing to hold it as a financial investment? And another question I have is just regarding the RWA guidance to \u20ac300 billion in 2025. Can you help us break down the drivers a little bit? We've got the Basel IV impact. But what are the other moving parts, considering that this is above consensus expectations?"

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Okay. I'll take Commerzbank. So obviously, the reason we have 3 or 4 quarters is because we are sticking by what we said, and we are waiting to be able to engage with a new government before we do anything else on Commerzbank such as launching a bid. If you go through the time line, that takes you through 3, 4, 5 quarters, depending what you assume. I also highlight to everybody that if and when we were to launch a bid, the decision remains firmly with us, and we would launch a bid when we are ready, not in automatic following of whatever we do -- we achieve in terms of negotiation with the government. So that is why the time line. In terms of the maximum time and what we do next, it will very much depend on the outcome of all of these conversations and discussions. So at the moment, I cannot tell you."

        "speaker": "Stefano Porro",
        "text": "So in relation to risk-weighted asset guidance, so let's start from starting point, \u20ac277 billion. Q1, we have Basel impact. So the Basel impact is in basis points, 80 basis points in terms of risk-weighted asset number will be between \u20ac14 billion and \u20ac15 billion. The Basel impact on the full year, taking consideration the mitigating actions that we will perform during the course of the year, will be around \u20ac12 billion. So that's the reason why the full year impact is around 60 basis points of common equity tier 1 ratio. Then we have model changes during the course of 2025 are primarily related to multinational clients and [indiscernible] model locally from an overall amount of around \u20ac8 billion during the course of primarily first half of 2025. Important to take into consideration that we will keep on doing active portfolio management action during the course of the year, In '24, we have done around \u20ac13 billion. In '25, we will do more than \u20ac7 billion of active portfolio management action, including also securitization. The business dynamic will be driven by the lending volumes that are expected to be higher than 2024, with a growth rate that will be, let's say, in line with the GDP expectation for 2025."

        "text": "The first is on distribution. You guide for organic distributions over \u20ac9 billion each of the next 3 years and net profit ambition going towards \u20ac10 billion with distributions close to net profit, while also targeting \u20ac6.5 billion excess capital redistribution by 2027 after M&A. Keeping the math simple, can we therefore dream of over \u20ac30 billion cumulative 2025-'27 distribution? And this is on a stand-alone basis, while you have more than one M&A front open. So how should we look at your 2025 targets? How do they change? If you would be successful on the BPM offer? And how should we consolidate the Commerzbank stake in 2025? Second question is on Russia. You're providing 2025 target and saying you are compliant with ECB order. Can we therefore, consider the credit being forced to sell Russia at \u20ac1 as an unlikely event? And finally, if you could just provide the off-balance sheet DTAs remaining."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "Okay. All right. So I like to dream, but you have a calculator, you can get to your own numbers. What I can tell you is that we have just committed to pay in excess of \u20ac9 billion per year for 3 years. And we confirm that we are returning the entire $6.5 billion of excess capital by '27. That's also within 3 years. I think it's a little bit more than a dream. Let's put it this way. The second thing is, yes, this is the base case. So as you can say, and I underscore that, because given the excitement that M&A brings everybody tends to deviate. And I remind everybody that everybody tended to deviate the first day I got here. And I think you would agree that not doing M&A got us quite far. This is the same for the next 3 years. The difference is that we now have 2 possibilities on the table, but there is no way that we will risk derailing what we feel is an exciting plan that combines profitable growth higher than most of our peers and distribution definitely higher than most of our peers to do M&A at the wrong terms or in the wrong way or at the wrong price. So this is the premise, and I want to make it clear. So that then brings you to your question, well, if you do M&A, what happens to our distribution, et cetera. At the moment, I can only give you what I have for certain. So first, 2024 distribution will be done, meaning they will be done just after the M&A complete, one way or the other, because we have committed to them. So what remains to be done in terms of dividend will be done slightly before. What remains to be done in terms of share buyback will be done later because we cannot interfere with our share price during the offer period. Secondly, if we were to do M&A, what is the impact on 2025 distributions in general, okay? So that's the second question. So if we were able to complete BPM, what would happen? My view, nothing would happen, meaning the 2020 -- we have said that we will strive to maintain the dividend per share equal for our shareholders, and that will happen. Secondly, all the planned distribution to shareholders will continue as if the acquisition has not occurred. What you will have is a dilution of your excess capital at the tail of 2027, right? Because we're using some of it, we would be using some of it to do the transaction. But by the time you get to 2027, we are -- we would have fully integrated the bank. It would be more than halfway through getting to the level of performance that we are, and it would positively contribute to our distribution on an organic, recurrent, ordinary fashion. So it's accretive, and that's exactly what we have said we would do. I am not going to speculate on Commerzbank because it's not on the table. And if you think about it, Andrea, if you believe, and I let you decide 3 quarters, 4 quarters, assuming it goes ahead, after that, you should add 9 months. It takes you very quickly into '27. So I know a lot of people are speculating about that, but most of our plan is going to be done without any impact from that. The second thing that I would say is even if we consolidated the stake in '25 because we get authorization to reach the 30% physical shares, but consolidation will only very mildly affect our CET1 ratio, given that it would remain to be hedged. And therefore, the distribution would not be affected by that in the least, okay? The other thing, Russia, let me remember what we said. So I cannot speculate on what may happen or not happen. But you do know the way we have managed the situation, finding the right balance between doing what we felt is right, morally correct and defending the interest of our shareholders and incidentally of our people. We will continue to do so. And therefore, as far as we are concerned, your selling for \u20ac1, et cetera. If it's me, unless I'm forced, I will not be selling Russia for \u20ac1 or for anything that is not a \"fair price.\" At the moment, I remind you, we have a bank that has less than \u20ac1 billion in deposits, less than \u20ac1 billion in loans. That is probably a payment reference in corporate, but all within the sanction framework and increasingly under the ECB order, and that focused on euro and U.S. dollar and which is primarily targeted to serving Western clients that still are operating in the country. The retail is being reduced to 0, and this is what we have. Where we go from there will depend on a number of other scenarios, but selling for 0 is not in the card. I also would like to highlight that Russia becomes quite marginal in our numbers. One of the reason why we grow in \"only\" to \u20ac10 billion in net profit is because we absorb the entire contribution for Russia during the period. So we are assuming that the contribution will trend to 0 by '27."

If we will move from an equity position, so with shares from 9 to 29 as highlighted by Andrea, during the course of '25, in such a case, the impact will be around 30 basis points of common equity tier 1 ratio, so well within the capital buffer that we have. In relation to the DTA, so we have in-balance sheet DTA in relation to Italian perimeter for \u20ac4 billion. There is nothing more that we can recognize in Italy. That means that from this moment onwards, it's not a P&L topic. It's a capital topic. So when we will utilize these DTAs, we will generate capital. By when we will do that? We will do that in the course of the next 6 years, which is the overall capital benefit from this is around 140 basis points of capital. In relation to the off-balance sheet DTAs that we can further writing up is around \u20ac400 million pertaining to the Austrian perimeter. And we might do the writeup, let's say, already during the course of '25, provided that the profitability will bring us to such a conclusion."

        "text": "It's Antonio from Bank of America. I have 2 questions, please. One on strategy and one on your mid-term profit aspirations. On the first question, since you've joined UniCredit, you've launched a number of initiatives to grow back into your product factories. We've seen it in payments, life insurance and a number of others. So I've seen increasingly this trend in Italy. There's been, I think, a shift in focus and attention towards preserving Italian savings. And you've often talked about UniCredit when it comes to asset management being a distributor of AUM products rather than a manufacturer. So I wonder if your strategy or vision about this with respect to asset management, in particular, has changed in any way? That's my first question. Maybe I can complement that or you can complement the answer by also sharing your views on insurance and why you've decided to cross the 5% stake in Generali ahead of their Board renewal in May. And you've partly answered the second question, which is around your profit aspirations. I think you have clear stand-alone targets, and people will give you credit on delivery. You talked about your vision for UniCredit to become the Bank of Europe's future, which is a project that's taking shape as we speak it's becoming more and more tangible at least versus when you first talked about it. So my question is why not put a number on this vision and aspire to more than the \u20ac10 billion? That's my second question. I'll stop here."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "I like the try on the more than \u20ac10 billion. So Antonio, let me start with the last one. If -- as I'm sure you have, if you did the numbers on the inertial impact, that we all tend to minimize of rich normalization, cost of risk increase, impact from inflation on cost on European banks, I think you would agree that the number is quite large. So for us, to add to that the additional compression to 0 of Russia and tell you that by '27 we are adding \u20ac700 million is, I would say, ambitious and realistic. That does not mean we can't do better, but it does mean that, at this point in time, based on all the uncertainty and the scenarios that we have, we put on the table what believe we can do and then we review if the scenarios improved. Not every bank scenario is as, let's say, demanding as ours in terms of the macro evolution. We believe it will have a very important impact. But what I believe we're not wrong is that whatever the scenario will be, we will do better. I am absolutely confident and determined to do that because of the strengths of the organization, of the reengineering of the organization, of lines of defense, of the clarity and granularity of each single action that every bank, every division, every person has and is executing. So I cannot control the environment. But on parity of environment, I am absolutely confident we will do better than everybody else. So for the time being, \u20ac10 billion stays because my best view of the macro environment is one that is quite conservative, and we will operate within that. With respect to -- and then, obviously, if we do M&A, the number moves. But for the time being, let's keep it there. If we do strategy since -- on the factories and savings, et cetera. Firstly, there is an important question out there that some of you or in particularly one person keeps on raising is whether the Danish compromise square is going to have a life or not. I remind everybody that for the time being, it's somewhere in purgatory, it hasn't been confirmed, okay? So as I said at the beginning of a plan, I did not believe into internalizing certain areas of insurance. But if a Danish compromise was going to be passed, we would. It was, we are. Let's see if a Danish compromise square is passed, and then let's review the position. That's number one. Number two, there is a big difference between what we're doing in insurance and what we would be doing in asset management. In insurance, we're processing unit linked and quite standardized and simple products for banks. In asset management, we do not believe we have the scale across products to compete with the leaders in the segment. I don't believe many people have. That does not mean we cannot have some, let's say, focused niches where we do internalize in full. We have that in our asset management company, primarily for Central and Eastern Europe, but now extensively more for the group in Croatia. We do have that in our project with Azimut. If you look at our capability to drive, differentiate on our brand, we've won markets, it speaks by itself. If we were to do an acquisition in Italy and that acquisition came with a factory in asset management, which is quite focused on certain standardized, simpler products that work well in Italy, that would complement that element of internalization. But by and large, if you look at the totality of our masses, the ability to have our own asset manager in-house for everything, I don't think is realistic. Honestly, I don't think it's realistic for any bank in Italy at least. So that, I think, is that. So I think it's a question of degrees. And I would also say that the control, if you want to call it this way, of savings remaining in Italy can be done if the distributor has a very strong position in all the contracts and in all the partnership and in all the way, it allocates those funds. This is what we have today, and therefore, I'm not concerned about that. Why cross 5% of Generali? I could tell you why not, but it's also -- I highlight. We do not only hold what we hold. As UniCredit, we also hold what our clients want to hold. And as a result of all the speculation, our clients are quite active. So I'm just telling you, together with our clients, we've crossed 5%. I mean, if you look at the magnitude of it, we've already spent a lot of time on it. The -- but what is important is that is not industrial. That is not aiming to buy or otherwise engage or whatever. It is a financial stake. It is in our investment portfolio. Because we bought it over several months, we have a significant capital gain. Part of it is hedged, as always. We -- they are a partner in Central and Eastern Europe and in other areas. And it is something that at this point in time makes sense. And for those of you, as I repeated that know me by now, we will not engage in adventures. We will engage in value creation, industrial projects and creating value for shareholders. And that should frame all the question on Generali."

      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "So on BPM, I think we are in the middle of a transaction or of an offer. And therefore, we are limited on what we can share. The transaction has -- or the offer has a time line. We are in the phase where we need to obtain authorization from regulators, from antitrust, golden power, et cetera. And therefore, we are in a situation of hold. There is nothing out of the ordinary into that process, and we are continuing along the time line. We have already set an indication for a potential EGM. It may move forward, backwards depending on the time to obtain those authorization. At the time being, it's our best guess. I -- personally, I think that the government or the leadership of the government was quite clear that they respect market and they respect -- they let it work, and that is what is happening at the moment. With respect to discussion with any non-shareholders, I remind you that we are in an offer, so we need to observe -- we can talk to them, but we need to observe pari-passu and treat them all the same. Credit Agricole is a partner of ours in asset management. It's a partner of ours in custody. It is a partner of ours in a number of places. We have talked to them and that is the extent for the time being. So as we get closer to the offer, maybe, there will be more discussion. But at this time, that is what it is. With respect to net profit, and then I'll pass to Stefan on NII in general, but, look, I think there are a lot of moving parts. In my opinion, if you go from an average Euribor of 3.6% and you dropped to 2.3% or could even drop to 2% or could even drop to 1.8%, for people to say that it will not have an impact on -- a material impact on your NII, particularly in countries where the pass-through has been low, is not realistic. We believe we will have most of our impact in NII will be concentrated in Italy. Hence, our attention to what people say because I do think that if Italy has a very low pass-through and benefit on the way up, just mathematically, it's going to be affected on the way down, okay? Other countries, take, for example, Germany and Austria have a pass-through all already in the 50s because they're, one, is mostly a corporate bank, et cetera. Obviously, they're going to be affected by the declining rate to a much lesser extent because they will manage the margin. And Central and Eastern Europe will grow. So in our profile, if I were to tell you about NII, Italy gets hit. The rest of the group supports and offset parts of that hit. And obviously, Stefan will look at that. But there is another thing that we're doing or we have been doing. I don't think people have picked that up enough is over the last 3, 4 years, when we say that our NII RoAC is highest profitability, it also means that we have cleaned up our underperforming exposures in terms of profitability. That means we don't need to clean them up again. That means that when you look at our growth of NII in the last 3, 4 years, it is net of the cleanup we did in our tank of past exposures, but were below the cost of equity. When we say that we grow with discipline, it means we are constraining growth because we only grow when it's above the cost of equity. So going forward, we will have some tailwinds from being in the right segments, in the right products, take consumer finance over mortgages and having completed this cleanup. Even so, we think it's going to have a very meaningful impact, which we're trying to compensate through fees, through cost, through cost of risk and then the balance below the line. But I'll leave it to Stefano go in detail on NII."

        "speaker": "Stefano Porro",
        "text": "So let's start from the assumptions. So rates, average Euribor '24 was 3.6%; '25, we're assuming 2.3%. So it's more than 100 basis point reduction. Our net interest income sensitivity is around \u20ac300 million for impact to revenues for every 50 basis points, okay? So following the simple movement of the rates, we should have that impact. Then we have Russia. So we keep on reducing the exposure to Russia. But there is also an assumption in relation to the rate reduction in Russia. So we're expecting that the net interest income contribution from Russia to the group will be few hundreds million less in terms of net interest income. Then we have spreads and volumes. On the loan spread side, we are expecting to have an higher client spread, similar to what happened during the course of '24. This will happen also during the course of '25. Every basis point better is around \u20ac40 million better from net interest income standpoint. So this will be a mitigating factor. Volume-wise, as I was commenting before, we are expecting more loans, right? So this will also be a positive impact, whose effect will be more in '26 rather than '25. On the deposit side, the deposit pass-through will remain substantially flat. Clearly, the client rate will go down but as happened during the course of Q4, you saw that deposit volume went up. So we are also expecting that deposits will grow. So all in all, this will counter mitigate the effect they are having from the reduction of the markdown on the deposit. Finally, there is the replicating portfolio, the replicating portfolio contribution, so the hedging on the deposit was more than \u20ac450 million positive in '24. We are expecting that in '25, the contribution will not be meaningful. But if you look at the period '25, '27, the contribution to the net interest income will be positive, and it will be around \u20ac300 million. Last but not least, there is the change of perimeter. Watch out, the change of the perimeter because there is Alpha Romania. So Alpha Romania contributed for only \u20ac30 million to the net interest income of Q4, while the contribution for the full year will be clearly more than \u20ac100 million to the net interest income of the group."

If you could elaborate a bit on how do you see the credit quality evolving in your 3 key core markets and whether there is any sign of deterioration? How much of that partial usage of overlays would be beyond '25? And the second question, I mean, just looking to your cost-to-income ratio going forward, and then you have done an excellent job in terms of cost-to-income, how much lower can it go? I mean, do you think that the 30% is around the bottom? Or we could see further improvements on cost-to-income ratio?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel",
        "text": "So let me start with the cost side. So obviously, the cost-income ratio has 2 elements and in my revenues are compressing. There is a limit to where we can go. So we have set a target of 40%. 40% for '25, 40% for the plan that we have in the next 3 years. I remind you, we had 50% last time around when we did the first phase of UniCredit Unlocked. So to do 40% in a, let's say, more challenging top line environment, it means we need to continue improving cost. And we need to continue improving cost in an inflationary environment. So this is what we discussed at the beginning. Now is the time that we were waiting for everybody to cross because we have revenue being compressed and cost being driven up by inflation. And the jaws are coming together. On revenue, we'll discuss separately or we have on cost, partially be taking more than \u20ac3.5 billion of extraordinary charges in the last 3 years. We have prepared ourselves to be able to absorb the inflation and maybe grind slightly lower on similar perimeter, which means the enlarged perimeter at the moment with Romania, with Vodeno, with all of these is about \u20ac9.6 billion. We are aiming to hold, and that means absorbing all the inflation, the renegotiation of contract and everything else that is within that. So not an easy one. And for us, the cost of holding has already been taken. So it's not going to be below the line in the following years or it's going to be to a much lesser degree. So on that position, we think we are in a better position than almost anyone. With respect to the revenue line, obviously, we have all the offset that we have discussed, difficult in '25 because the compression of rates have an impact on our revenue concentrated in '25, then it loosens as we go through growth in '26 and '27. And the fees continue to grow into '25, '26, '27. So the revenue line will become more of an advantage once we trough in 2025. So 2025 is the difficult time. On asset quality, what I would say is, while we're cautious because I've never seen a cycle where cost of risk does not go up. At the moment, we don't have significant indication of worsening. Yes, we have a fall here and a fall there. But when I look at the numbers, they're really quite minor. I remind you that we had the first 3 quarters with a cost of risk almost in the single digits. And we, again, were conserving by, let's pay -- let's say, being over conservative in the force by creating specific provisions, we couldn't build more our overlays to make sure that whatever happens in the next 3 years, we are prepared. And therefore, the cost of risk of the last quarter is up, but it's not up because, Oh, my God, the asset quality is degenerating. It's up because of one position, but most importantly, because we are further strengthening our provisions. And so in '25, it depends the use of overlays, it depends what you assume. If you assume that the cost of risk jumps for the industry or for us, 25, 30, 35, then you can calculate how much overlays we're going to release on top. if you don't assume that, then we're not going to use any overlays. But the overlays are there to be used. And I remind everybody in doing your numbers, if -- as we are expecting the cost of risk trends up materially, they will be used to keep it below 25 -- 20 to 25 basis points. Actually, now, we assume even lower because we've given you 15. If the cost of risk does not increase, as many people -- some people are assuming, then the overlays are going to be released over the next 3 years. And we are going to become a net propeller of our bottom line as we get released. We can't keep them there forever."

        "speaker": "Stefano Porro",
        "text": "So I can give you some data points more, just to add. So if you look 2024, the cost of risk of the group was 15. Then if you look the different countries, we were at around 30 basis points in Italy, 20 in Germany. Austria was single digit, was 7. But Central Europe was having a negative cost of risk for -- I mean, Eastern Europe, specifically for around minus 5. Why? Because we had a lot of write-backs. The situation will change, right? Because while we will see very likely a similar cost of risk for Italy probably something less for Germany, in the case of Eastern Europe, we will go back to normal, right? So we will go back to a positive cost of risk. Commenting on the default rates. So as highlighted by Andrea, in '24, the default rate of the group portfolio was 1.3%. But then if we're adjusting for a few big tickets, the overall portfolio had a default rate of 1%. That was fundamentally the same that we experienced in '22 and in '23. So fundamentally, there is stability in relation to that. And in '24, both Germany and Austria, just for these few big tickets were below 1%. So we were respectively 0.7% and 0.9%. So what we are currently assuming for the future is, let's say, a trend of the default rate that will not be significantly different from what we had in 2024. Slightly worse, but not meaningfully worse than this."

Shall I take this that this new level of profitability also as a bar for the threshold to proceed with M&A? Because if I'm not mistaken, to my memory, you said in the past that you never have executed any deal with a return on investment capital below 15%. So I'm wondering whether with increased profitability on a stand-alone basis, this 15% has now increased to 17%. And the second question is on your Generali investment. Clearly, this is a financial investment, but you are now one of the 4 largest shareholder of the group. And as such, I would like to share -- if you can share with us your views on the recently announced deal that Generali and with [Natixis], what are your views there? Are you supporting it?

And secondly, we've often mentioned a return on investment of 15%. We also said that it's rate dependent, and it's country-dependent. But on average, it is correct. What do I mean by that? I mean that if rates go to -- if rates were at 4% and now they are 2%, I need to also not be unrealistic. But as of now, I would say that our commitment that if you do your projection on, I don't know, buying back x billions of our shares at current market prices versus M&A, we should be -- the -- I should be able to argue to you that M&A is better or not do it at all. I think it's the easiest way because [Natixis] Capital and myself are going to go in 1 of 2 directions, buy back my shares or buy the shares of another bank and bring in their earnings. If that does not compare favorably, I shouldn't be doing it, okay? Then we can discuss whether it is immediately on the year 1 or within the first 1.5 to 2 years, but that is the point. So that will not change. And it is our bar, and this is what we committed to investors, and we're not changing. On Generali, I know everybody makes a big deal out of it. I am not going to comment on a deal of another company. Let's say that, at this point in time, we are -- we made an investment. We know it has significance, but we are so focused on executing our Q1 and the 2 transactions that potentially are on the table that we don't spend much time on that.

We have a stock of \u20ac176 billion of hedging to the deposit and consider that every year, we are rolling between, let's say, \u20ac18 million and \u20ac20 billion. That is that you can derive, which is the sensitivity to the long-term part of the curve because when we do the rolling, we are hitting the long-term part of the curve. So 10 basis points, you multiply 10 basis points by \u20ac20 billion. So this is the impact that they're having, for example, for a reduction of 10 basis points in the long-term part of the curve."

We announced we would move to 29% or below 30% and ask authorization. We did that. When the position was made that we were not welcome, we said we would wait to engage with the government, and that is what we're doing. I don't have a position optimistic. However, I have a position of I do think the deal makes sense for all involved, and we will be waiting to present that position at the appropriate time in the future, and that is it. We are -- I personally, I'm optimistic that with fact in figures, it will be recognized. But for the time being, that's where we are. As we are where we are, and we have a stake, number one, as a shareholder, I am satisfied at the fact that the company is now shaking up things and trying to have a new plan and progress further. That's always positive. And hopefully that, that drives an improvement in their structural profitability, core structural profitability. And we can observe that over the time that is needed to talk to all interested party and see where we land. But that's not changed. So we are where we are. We'll see at the end of that what will happen, but I'm optimistic that with constructive conversation, you get to a positive outcome."

I guess, when you speak to ECB and present the capital plan for approval, there may be a change in perimeter and elevated operating and integration risks associated with that perimeter change. So how should we think about the risks or complexities of getting that \u20ac3.6 billion approved and executed in H2? And then secondly, on the \u20ac2 billion advisory and financing business, how do you see the growth outlook for that business in particular in 2025, maybe in the context of sort of ongoing trade and political uncertainty impacting businesses across the markets?"

I don't think that the potential acquisition of BPM affects the authorization on the share buyback, which is ongoing and exactly as all the others. The execution is not in fact affected by the ECB or regulators. It's affected by the correct orderly market -- maintenance of orderly market, which comes of the -- expects and buying back your own shares, while your shares are being offered for a transaction. It is not something that should be done. So depending on all the authorization, et cetera, we will execute the share buyback just after the transaction. If for any reason the transaction is delayed, we will execute as much of a share buyback that we can before the transaction is launched. So that -- and we remain committed to getting it done as quickly as possible. It's just a question that we will have a period within which we can't execute."

However, when we're looking to 2025, especially in relation to the German related activity is worthwhile to highlight the expectation. So the pipeline is not bad, but clearly, there is uncertainty also connected to election and to the overall evolution of the economy. So all in all, apart from consideration related to the market volatility -- to the financial market volatility, we are expecting acceleration of the growth in the second part of the year."

  "2025Q1": {
    "date": "2025-05-12",
    "transcript": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before I hand over to Magda Palczynska, Head of Investor Relations, a reminder that today's call is being recorded. Madam, you may begin.\nMagda Palczynska : Good morning, and welcome to UniCredit's First Quarter 2025 Results Conference Call. Andrea Orcel, our CEO, will take you through the presentation. This will be followed by a Q&A session with Andrea and Stefano Porro, our CFO. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I'll hand over to Andrea.\nAndrea Orcel : Good morning. Before I take you through our results, strategy and prospects, I would like to take this opportunity to thank, once again, our people, the true engine of UniCredit, whose passion, dedication, hard work and excellence make this possible quarter after quarter. Q1 2025 marks the beginning of Phase 2 of UniCredit Unlocked, unlocking acceleration. While we continue to optimize our operating model, we are now focused on fully leveraging our structural commercial strengths to drive top line growth. This quarter's result, well ahead of our plan across all KPIs, confirm the resilience of our core business, the depth of our transformation and the strength of our future trajectory. Our performance is anchored on 3 pillars. First, financial strengths. Q1 marks the best quarter in our history, solidifying our record of quality delivering across all KPIs, building a significant buffer to improve our own projection for 2025 while increasing our lines of defense. This meaningfully differentiates us our present and expected future performance versus that of our peers. Second, structural strengths. We operate a unique pan-European platform, diversified across countries, client segments and business lines. This gives us reach and resilience, allowing us to reallocate capital towards the highest return opportunities while absorbing local volatility and delivering both quality growth and distributions. Third, our ever-evolving transformation. Between '21 and '24, we focused on redesigning and streamlining our operating machine, while rebuilding and reigniting our commercial one. We are now shifting to acceleration, optimizing our operating machine while accelerating our commercial machine by targeting the right geographies, the right client segments, the right channels and the right products. While the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, our disciplined execution and solid foundation give us confidence. Our previous guidance included softer net operating profit through '25 due to normalizing rates and cost of risk, with improvement weighted towards Q4, also due to lesser nonoperating charges. This, along with returning excess capital, was expected to keep net income and return on tangible equity broadly in line with '24 and ensure higher distributions than '24. That trajectory for the next 3 quarters remains unchanged. However, our outperformance in Q1 across nonoperating profit, net income, return on tangible equity and organic capital generation allows us to upgrade our 2025 guidance. We now expect to exceed '24 net income and RoTE with distribution above last year by more than initially anticipated, benefited from higher net profit growth. Should this momentum continue into Q2 and early Q3, we will consider further upgrades to our guidance. Our ambitions for '26-'27 and beyond are unchanged, but we approach them with even greater confidence. This is a story of organic quality profitable growth and distribution unmatched in Europe, strengthened by selective inorganic opportunities but will only be pursued if they enhance our already best-in-class stand-alone case. Q1 '25 marked a historic milestone for UniCredit. We delivered record results across all KPIs, further improved their quality and further strengthened our capital, asset quality, liquidity and lines of defense. Net revenue increased 3.2% with excellent fee generation more than compensating net NII decline, all further boosted by trading. NII RoAC increased to 20%, best-in-class. Fees grew to 36% of total revenues, while on their way to 40%. We reduced cost by 1.3% at constant perimeter, almost compensating the impact from first-time consolidation; reducing our stated cost-to-income ratio to 35.4%, beating peers by a significant margin. We grew net revenue over RWAs to 9.2%, while absorbing the bulk impact, generating EUR 3.1 billion of capital organically and EUR 5.3 billion overall. Net profit increased 8.3% to EUR 2.8 billion at an industry record 22% return on tangible equity, unadjusted from our significant excess capital. Adjusted for that excess capital at 13% CET1, our return on tangible equity would have been 26%. Our profitable growth allowed us to offset the impact from Basel, accrue 100% of net income in distribution while increasing our CET1 ratio to 16.1%, 16.6%, excluding the accrued SBB. Our per share growth is even more impressive. EPS, up 18%. Dividend per share, up 46%, tangible book per share, up 17%, including dividends. We achieved Q1 results while maintaining our EUR 3 billion buffers intact, EUR 1.3 billion nonoperating items and EUR 1.7 billion of overlays, and increasing NPE coverage by 1 percentage point and our excess capital to EUR 8.5 billion to EUR 10 billion or circa EUR 7.5 billion, excluding the more volatile elements. So we stand prepared for the future. This is the result of a deliberate strategic transformation, which balances delivering in the short term with continued investments supporting long-term performance. This position UniCredit as a benchmark for banking. We grew our net revenues by 3.2% year-on-year and 14.6% quarter-on-quarter without compromising quality, as proven by strong fee growth more than offsetting expected NII decline. Combined net NII and fee grew 1.6% year-on-year. Trading contribution continues to be positive, as we offer essential hedging to our clients in FX, in rates and commodities, leveraging our unique pan-European network. 2/3 of our trading was client-driven in that area with the remainder resulting from strong performance of our treasury and investment portfolio. Cost of risk remained benign at 8 basis points. NII showed resilient profitability driven by positive margins and benign cost of risk. UniCredit maintained discipline even as other banks, particularly M&A targets, pushed for higher volumes and drove pricing to value-destructive levels. Our unwavering focus on EVA-positive volumes over volumes at any cost is delivering as our net NII trajectory is better than the sector, while its profitability is significantly greater, reaching a best-in-class RoAC of 20%. We continue to have excellent pass-through management with the average in the quarter down 1.3 percentage points to 32.6%. Magda Palczynska UniCredit S.p.A. \u2013 Head of Group Investor Relations We're just going to pause the call for 5 minutes while the audio is resolved. Sorry, just a moment, please. Okay. Thank you, everyone. We'll restart. Apologies for that.\nAndrea Orcel : Apologies. We are on Slide 4 and for anything you missed in the first part of the presentation, we'll take questions later. So we start from Slide 4. We grew our net revenues by 3.2% year-on-year and 14.6% Q-on-Q without compromising quality, as proven by strong fee growth, more than offsetting expected NII decline. Combined net NII and fees grew 1.6% year-on-year. Trading contribution continues to be positive as we offer essential hedging to our clients in FX, rates and commodities, leveraging our unique pan-European network. 2/3 of our trading was client-driven with the remainder resulting from strong performance of our treasury and investment portfolio. Cost of risk remains benign at 8 basis points. NII showed resilient profitability, driven by positive margin and benign cost of risk. UniCredit maintained discipline even as other banks, particularly M&A targets, pushed for higher volumes and drove pricing to value-destructive levels. Our unwavering focus on EVA-positive volumes over volumes at any cost is delivering as our net NII trajectory is better than the sector, while its profitability is significantly greater, reaching a best-in-class return on average equity of 20%. We continue to have excellent pass-through management with the average of -- in the quarter down 1.3 percentage points to 32.6%. Asset quality remains strong and stable. Our gross and net NPE ratio remained respectively at 2.6% and 1.4% with coverage increasing 1 percentage point Q-on-Q to 47%. Cost of risk remains structurally low at 8 basis points, broadly flat versus the first quarter of '24 and down significantly on Q4 due to the prudent approach we took to further reinforce our strong coverage on a number of files. While we increased coverage, we're still benefiting from write-backs, confirming quality origination and conservative provisioning. We maintain our EUR 1.7 billion overlays impact. They will act as a buffer against any potential deterioration in asset quality. No other institution has this level of absolute and relative overlays and has delivered this benign cost of risk without ever touching them, but rather increasing them. Our default rate is down to 0.9%. Our fee income reached a new record, growing 8.2% year-on-year and remarkable 16.5% quarter-on-quarter. Of particular note is the breadth of this growth across fee category and regions. Investment-related fees rose 13% year-on-year, insurance 5%, with non-life up 14%. Payment and current account, 1%; advisory and financing 4%; client hedging fees up 25%. Fees in Italy increased 7.8%; Germany, 7%, excluding financing fees coming from very high base; Austria, 8.5%; and Central and Eastern Europe, 16.5%. The strength and diversification is by design. It reflects our strategic focus on building factories that can deliver resilient capital-light revenues across all regions, even in uncertain market conditions. Our fee to revenue ratio climbed to 36%, a top-tier level among European fee -- peers. Our cost-income ratio improved to 35.4%, the best in our peer group, driven by disciplined cost management, combined with targeted streamlining. At constant perimeter, cost decreased 1.3% year-on-year, while maintaining our level of investment in our people, in our business and in our technology. Stated costs increased 0.6% year-on-year due to our first time consolidation of Aion-Vodeno and Alpha Bank Romania, which currently have cost-income ratios far above group average. As we fully unlock their revenue-generating potential, they will meaningfully contribute to our future growth and operational efficiency. This quarter, UniCredit generated EUR 3.1 billion of capital organically and EUR 5.3 billion or 190 basis points overall. This absorbed the Basel impact of circa 60 basis points, 20 basis points less than originally anticipated. The distribution accrual of 100 basis points or 100% of the EUR 2.8 billion net profit, while further increasing our CET1 ratio 27 basis points to 16.1%. Excluding the share buyback accrual, CET1 ratio would stand at 16.6%. Our current CET1 ratio implies a buffer of EUR 8.5 billion to EUR 10 billion, so between 313 and 363 basis points above our 12.5% to 13% CET1 ratio target. This is EUR 1 billion to EUR 2.5 billion above what we prudently define as our excess capital that now stand at circa EUR 7.5 billion. The difference includes both a proven buffer for other regulatory headwinds for more volatile items such as the gain from strategic investment, net of hedging and from Russia. We have the highest level of excess capital in the peer group. This is a testament to the strength of our business model, highly profitable, highly capital efficient and able to fund growth, best-in-class distribution and regulatory requirement simultaneously. Our capital discipline gives us both certainty and strategic optionality, whether for organic investment, share buybacks or potential inorganic investment. Our liquidity position is strong and sustainable. Our LCR and SFR above 140% and 125%, respectively, are sound and well above our peer average. Our loans-to-deposit ratio stands at 87%, notwithstanding our focus on the deposit pass-through, well below 100%. In general, a higher loan-to-deposit ratio, not only requires relying on more expensive source of funding, but also correlates with increased liquidity risk, particularly during period of market stress or geopolitical uncertainty. We have reinforced our European leadership across all KPIs, widening the gap versus peers. The high-quality revenue growth, coupled with best-in-class operating and capital efficiency leads to unmatched profitability and capital generation. Our 22% return on tangible equity is 7 percentage points higher than the average of our peers. It would be even higher if we normalize for our excess capital relative to them. We generate more than twice the capital organically than the average of our peers. We're confident we can widen this gap further. Our strengths and lines of defense, including our excess capital, are unmatched and derisk or boost our profitability and distribution going forward. Our structural advantages and the way we are leveraging them are the foundational elements of our success. We operate a truly pan-European franchise that leverages scale with local depth. Our geographic footprint is balanced across 4 powerful regions: Italy, Germany, Austria and Central and Eastern Europe. This footprint allows us to deliver quality profitable growth and distribution regardless of local volatility. Our client base is well balanced between attractive SME, affluent and private clients and large corporate mass market clients that we approach differently. We leverage common platform and scale while tailoring products to each client segment. Our business mix is supported by group factories that deliver best-in-class product tailored for local clients' needs. What we are seeing now is the real power of convergence across our regions and product factories, increasingly working together to create synergies and reinforcing each other's strengths. Let me move to our regions. In Italy, our franchise continued to be market-leading by a wide margin across sustainable profitability, efficiency and capital generation. It is UniCredit quality earnings powerhouse, delivering impressive financial results as our transformation evolves from unlocking value to accelerating profitable growth. Gross revenues grew 1.4% to EUR 3 billion. Net revenue, 2.9%, driven by very strong fees up 8%, 2 percentage points more than each of our 2 Italian peers, more than offsetting a net NII decline of 1.6%, well below that of our 2 Italian peers. Our continued focus on margin rather than volume led to the increase of our NII ROAC to 25%, significantly above peers. Fee growth was well diversified with standout performance of our investment and non-life insurance fees. Our fee to revenue ratio in Italy reached a top-tier 42%. We maintained a low cost of risk at 26 basis points, down 7 points year-on-year, reinforcing coverage and without touching our overlays. Our gross and net NPE ratio remained at 2.7% and 1.5%, respectively, with increasing coverage Q-on-Q. However, our net NPE ratio adjusted for exposure covered by state guarantees with a 100% enforcement success rate, unlike many other banks, would drop to 0.9% and be almost entirely covered by our Italian overlays. Effectively, we're almost a 0 net NPE bank in Italy. Operational efficiency improved further to 32%. Costs were down 2.2% in spite of the continued investment in our people, business and technology. Capital efficiency improved with net revenue to RWA of 11.3%, up almost 1 percentage point year-on-year. The gap with the first and the third Italian bank increased to 0.5 percentage points and 2.5 percentage points, respectively. Profit before tax rose 70% year-on-year to EUR 1.9 billion, RoAC reached 37%, up 6 percentage points, the best in Italy by a margin. Organic capital generation reached EUR 1.6 billion, the best in Italy by a margin. As such, UniCredit was recognized as the best bank in Italy by IFR and the Global Finance Awards in 2025. Our continued investment in and support of development of our people through UniCredit Corporate University provides them with new challenges, new opportunities and career longevity. We continue to invest in technology to further improve client experience. Our recently introduced UCX SME Lending platform provides a fully digital end-to-end lending journey for SMEs, side-by-side with UCX consumers for family. We supported a number of innovative large corporate deals providing financial backing and strategic solution, reinforcing our role in enhancing the long-term competitiveness and resilience of core Italian companies. In the quarter, we facilitated over EUR 4.4 billion in financing in support of Italian SME client alone, as we target growth in this segment. Our dedication to Italy is further underscored by the EUR 35 billion invested to date in UniCredit per Italia that remains unmatched, and our Italian government bond exposure that account for 64% of our Italian legal entity sovereign exposure above our Italian competitor. These bonds currently have a positive mark-to-market value, and we have benefited from this position throughout the cycle. Germany. Our German bank continues to be the best performing in the country, increasing the gap versus peer. It is one of the 2 key anchors for the group and continues to deliver impressive financial results as its transformation evolves from unlocking value to accelerating profitable quality growth. Gross revenues grew 3.8% year-on-year to EUR 1.5 billion. Net revenue grew 6.3% without releasing any overlays, with fees and trading mostly client-driven, more than offsetting the 2.5% decline in net NII. As previously indicated, NII in Germany is affected by the client-driven increase in trading volume, as we booked trading-related funding cost in NII and increase in rates and/or volumes negatively impact NII while benefiting trading by an equal amount. When rates and volume decline, the opposite happens. As such, gross NII and net NII would have been up, respectively, 1% and 6% with trading up only 14%, assuming flat trading volume year-on-year. This performance is best-in-class in the country. Our 23% NII RoAC also remain the best-in-class in the country, increasing our lead versus our competitors as we focus on lending being significantly above our cost of equity in its own right. Fees adjusted for financing fees are up 7% driven by investment, up 7%; insurance, up 11%; and client hedging, up 11%. The decline in financing fees masked that growth as they normalize from a very strong base in Q1 2024. Cost of risk is down to 11 basis points with no usage of overlays. Our NPE ratio is stable at 2.2% with proven coverage improving. Operational efficiency improved further to 36%, widening the gap versus our closest competitor peer by 3 percentage points to 20 percentage points. Costs were down 1.9%, despite significant investment in technology and people. Capital efficiency improved further with net revenue over RWA of 8.7%, almost 1 percentage point higher year-on-year. Profit before tax rose 12% to EUR 0.9 billion compared to a decline at our closest peer. RoAC ended above 26%, up 3.7 percentage points over the year, the best in Germany, widening the gap to almost 2x our closest peers. As a result, organic capital generation reached EUR 800 million, investing in and for all our stakeholder within Germany is at the core of how we operate. We are the employer of choice with top employer certification for the 15th consecutive quarter. We achieved the highest NPS score among Mittelstand banks. A Germany's leading provider of FX hedging, together with those on recent commodities, we help protect the industry from volatility. We have been leading the defense and technology start-up sector and our German bank is well positioned to support this industry further. We hold a substantial share of our legal entity treasury portfolio in Germany, sub-sovereign bonds, a clear sign of our commitment to supporting regional resilience and public priorities. Austria. Our Austrian bank continues to be the best performing bank among our Austrian peers. It is one of the 2 key anchors for the group and continues to deliver impressive financial results, as its transformation evolves from unlocking value to accelerating profitable growth. Gross revenue grew 1.9% to EUR 700 million, driven by strong fees, up 8.5%, with together with dividends more than offset the 8% NII decline. Fee growth was driven by investments, plus 19%; and insurance, plus 96%, leading to a 33% fee to revenue, the highest in the country. Cost of risk remained positive due to repayments in performing loans with gross provision beginning to normalize. Operational efficiency remained at 39% with cost up 3.3% due to wage drift and a change in operating model that benefited the group but disadvantaged Austria due to its raising VAT. We continue to significantly invest in technology and people. Our capital efficiency remained strong with net revenue over RWA at 7%, notwithstanding the 8.5% increase in RWAs, mainly due to Basel, partially offset by mitigating actions. Profit before tax declined 4.4% when adjusting for VAT accounting and higher bank levy versus 8.2% stated. RoAC remained high at 24.4%, 25.8% adjusted, the best among Austrian banks. Organic capital generation reached EUR 400 million. Investing in and for all our stakeholders within Austria is at the core of how we operate. We were recognized as a top employer '25, extending green benefit and achieving the family-friendly employer certification for the sixth consecutive year. We advanced our technology initiatives, launching new self-issued credit cards, enhancing our mobile banking app with chatbot functionality. Central and Eastern Europe. Our Central and Eastern Europe franchise continues to be the most profitable and efficient in the region. It is the growth engine of the group and continues to deliver impressive financial results as its transformation evolves from unlocking value to accelerating profitable growth. Gross revenues grew 5% year-on-year to EUR 1.2 billion, driven by strong fees, up 17% and NII up 1.5%. Alpha Bank first-time consolidation, partially compensated for the significant drag of Hungary. The quality of our NII remains unmatched in the region, with NII RoAC at 25%. While competitors chase volume, we are maintaining discipline without sacrificing market share. The strong fee performance was broad-based and led to an increase of our fees to revenue ratio of 3 percentage points to 28%. Cost of risk remained positive due to repayment in performing loans with gross provision beginning to normalize. Operational efficiency remained best-in-class at 34% cost-income ratio, 32.9% excluding Alpha Romania. Costs were up 3.9%, excluding Alpha Romania, 13.8% stated, including Alpha Romania. We continue to significantly invest in technology and people. Our capital efficiency remains best-in-class with net revenue over RWA of 8.6% and stable despite an 8% increase in RWAs due to the Alpha merger and Basel impact. Profit before tax was up 1%, 4%, excluding Hungary. RoAC remained excellent at 26%, 30% excluding Hungary. Organic capital generation reached EUR 600 million. We advanced our technology initiatives with fast and easy onboarding for small corporates in Romania and faster micro business loan approvals in Serbia. Russia. We continue to work towards an accelerated ordinary wind-down of Russia, always within both the letter and the spirit of the complex legal, regulatory and sanction limitation. Our '25 targets communicated in the first half of '24 have already been reached last year. To better appreciate the impact of our action, we will comment the trends at constant foreign exchange starting Q1 2022. Local deposits declined to EUR 1.5 billion, minus 82% and further down 7% Q-on-Q. Net local loans declined to EUR 1 billion, minus 86% and further down 20% Q-on-Q. Cross-border lending declined 94% to date, and we reached practically 0 in Q3. Cross-border payments declined 70% to below EUR 8 billion per quarter and a further down 20% this quarter. We are now almost exclusively in euros and U.S. dollar. We have reduced the capital impact of a full write-down of Russia from circa 130 basis points on a 14% CET1 to circa 69 basis points on a 16.1% CET1 and maintain buffer in our excess capital to cover that. The 22 basis points increase versus previous quarter is solely due to ruble appreciation. We are compliant with applicable ECB targets and aim to continue our business compression in Russia, including a full orderly exit from the retail business by first half 2026. Product factories. Our product factories continue to drive differentiated quality growth. They delivered EUR 3.1 billion in gross revenues, up 7% year-on-year, with more than 67% of that coming from fees. Individual Solutions grew 9%, driven by Investment up 13% and Nonlife Insurance up 10%. One markets, assets under management reached EUR 18 billion, well ahead of plan, with our own managed fund sales increasing by more than 50%. We are well on our way to increasing value chain retention to more than 80% by internalizing and accelerating sales of our own products. This will provide Alpha growth above and beyond the market. Corporate Solutions grew 8% with fees up 13%, driven by Advisory and Financing and Client Risk Management. Client Risk Management grew 24%, testament to the value we add in supporting clients and the overall economy in volatile and uncertain markets. Our model is scalable, capital-light, provides value and is integrated across geographies. These factories are not only revenue generator through continued innovation and margin expansion, they are also critical in supporting clients and cementing their loyalty. They will continue to be a critical part of our unlocking acceleration strategy through 2027 and beyond. Q1 2025 marks the inflection point in our UniCredit Unlocked transformation journey. Between '21 and '24, we successfully unlocked trapped value by redesigning and streamlining our operating machine while rebuilding and reigniting our commercial machine. This allowed us to grow net profit significantly more than our peers, 2x in our calculation. We have already shifted gear from unlocking trapped potential to unlocking acceleration. In Phase 2 of our strategy, we will optimize our operating machine and further accelerate our commercial one. Despite industry headwinds, we are confident to deliver on our ambition of circa EUR 10 billion net profit at over 17% return on tangible equity by '27 and to grow further from that base as macro normalizes in the outer years. The impact from investment, both past, yet to fully crystallize and future, will build on our structural advantages and ensure further value creation. In the next 3 years, we will finalize unlocking trapped potential. We will continue to simplify, delay, streamline and change the way of working. We will finalize taking back control, boost investment in targeted technology and data enhancement and move into modernization, all to better support both our people and clients' journeys. We will complete the re-internalization of our product factories, most notably insurance already in Q2 and strengthen the connectivity between them and the client through increasingly digitalized and integrated channels and motivated network. In parallel, we are accelerating our top line growth with differentiated strategies per client segments and per geography. The aim is not just growth but targeted profitable growth with products that match client needs; distribution channel that puts choice in clients' hands; and data that powers personalization at scale. Our people and culture will continue to be central with sustained investment in empowerment, supported by simplification of processes and way of working and professional development delivered through Unicredit Corporate University. We are building not just a bigger bank, but a faster, more agile, more client-centric one, fully aligned with our structural strengths and long-term ambition. These steps ensure that every euro we invest translate into structured long-term value creation for our clients, for our shareholders, for our people and for our community with no waste. Our organic accelerator are already delivering, but their contribution will meaningfully increase in the years ahead. Initiatives like the internalization of our life insurance, the Alpha Bank integration in Romania, the very successful partnership with Alpha Bank in Greece and scaling up Aion-Vodeno are expected to contribute over EUR 400 million in additional net profit by 2027. This initiative will not only more than offset the compression of lower earnings from Russia, but also substantially improve the quality of our earnings and the growth potential after that. Aion-Vodeno allows us to profitably enter new markets such as retail and SMEs in Poland, where we signed up our first corporate deal. We are also expanding in Western Europe through a mobile-first model with regulatory applications underway. Banking-as-a-serving is scaling supported by a EUR 100 million capital increase from the group. In Romania, we've doubled our retail market share and added EUR 50 million in Q1 revenues alone. In Greece, we have successfully -- partners in trade finance, international payment and investment product with distribution of our One market funds well on its way to reach EUR 1 billion. These are in projection. They are real tangible growth levers already producing results. They enhanced revenue quality, support profitability and future-proof our earnings trajectory. Today, we have also announced another important milestone in our transformation journey. We are partnering with Google to accelerate our transformation, moving our application to cloud. This is a 360-degree partnership, well in line with our approach to build up a group ecosystem of best-in-class partners. It's a deep co-invested collaboration that is set to redefine how we operate, compete and innovate. Through Google, we are migrating our core system, our data and application to cloud, a move that will improve agility, reduce legacy complexity and enhance security. The migration is fully funded, delivering financial returns from day 1, while also decommissioning costly legacy infrastructure. On that basis, we maintain all of our cost commitments. Finally, this partnership goes well beyond technology. Google Cloud is committed to supporting UniCredit's people development, embedding a new way of working and training to best adopt cutting-edge AI and analytics. Google also offers us new business opportunity, leveraging their ecosystem for several services. Guidance. Thanks to a record-breaking first quarter, the transformation levers that drove it and our increased lines of defense, we're now upgrading our guidance for the full year 2025 to over EUR 9.3 billion at a return on tangible equity above 17%. We are, for now, maintaining the same conservative outlook for the rest of the year and expect the coming quarters to moderate with a decrease in net operating profit on a year-over-year basis, driven by an NII decline for the year, but we still expect to be above mid-single digits. We, however, now expect net revenues to end up better than originally anticipated at circa EUR 23.5 billion, driven by stronger Q1 and a more benign cost of risk for the year. Our confirmed guidance on cost will lead to a lower NOP that will be compensated by the significant reduction in nonoperating charges in Q4, all leading to the net profit and return on tangible equity guidance above. Depending on the actual performance of the business in Q2 and the beginning of Q3, there may be scope for further improve of our guidance. Distribution. We'll still exceed those in '24 and should further benefit from an increased net profit and organic capital generation. We reaffirm our '27 ambition, EUR 10 billion in net profit with return on tangible equity above 17% with annual distribution in excess of '24 for each one of the next 3 years. Our confidence is based on our financial strengths, a transformation leveraging our structural advantages, protected or propelled by our lines of defense. As we close, let me reiterate what this quarter represents. This is the best quarter in UniCredit's history, and it is not a one-off. It is the culmination of 17 quarters of profitable growth and progression through disciplined transformation from streamlining our operation to reigniting our commercial engine and ensuring our bank has a sustainable growing performance in the future. Every slide we've reviewed today points to a business that is outperforming peers' and our own expectations. We grow sustainably, while improving the quality of such growth. We lead on profitability, we lead on efficiency, we lead on capital generation and we lead on distributions. Our vision is clear. Our strategy is working. Our execution is disciplined. We have more value to unlock and more lines of defense to protect or propel us than any other peer. Looking ahead, we are focused on acceleration, leveraging our platform, scaling our products and unlocking further value through organic growth and selective strategic moves. We have inorganic possibilities in each one of our markets, some are visible, some are not. All can be closed by us, but we will close only those that add value to all of our stakeholders and, in particular, to our own shareholders. We are proud of what we've achieved and even more confident about what's to come. We're excited about our unmatched stand-alone profitable growth and distribution story. The resiliency and growth of our earnings and dividend per share trajectory are evident and superior to boast the average of the sector and those of peers with the highest valuation. The combination of these and the level of our current valuation, even before considering our significant lines of defense, makes our investment case compelling. Thank you very much, and we're now open to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Andrea Filtri, Mediobanca.\nAndrea Filtri : I've got 2. First, on guidance. How much of the potential upward revision of guidance on net revenues is from provisions and trading and how much from fees and costs? The second, inevitably, on M&A. The press report you're potentially reconsidering, the [indiscernible] that the Commerce Bank option would face similar political hostilities in Italy and that you could consider refocusing elsewhere. Can you help us make sense of this, please? If you put generic strategic objectives and you rank them according to the following, give us an idea of how you would rank them: first, fostering local distribution; secondly, expanding distribution to new markets; third, fostering or recomposing product factories and wealth management distribution.\nAndrea Orcel : Sorry, just trying to keep up, Andrea. Okay. So guidance. Let's put it this way. This quarter, you can take consensus, we can take our own expectation. We are EUR 400 million to EUR 500 million of net profit ahead of where everybody expected us to be. Those EUR 400 million to EUR 500 million of net profit are due to the following factors: a significant beat on core revenues with fees doing significantly better than we expected and NII doing exactly as we expected. Secondly, trading that was benign. And this trading benign, as we said, was linked to 2 pieces. One, the support of clients through our client risk management in FX rates and commodities, but is up 25% and is booked mostly there. And secondly, treasury and strategic portfolio performance. So finally, we had cost a little bit better than expected, cost of risk significantly better than expected and that takes you to the bottom line. So to answer your question, I would say the way we look at it is, if I take fee plus NII, the dynamic for the year will be better just because I have had a Q1 that is better and I'm maintaining my expectation for the next 3 quarters. I have also said that we may increase our guidance further. And the reason why we haven't gone further now is because we want to see in such a volatile environment what happens. But if some of the trends we're seeing are capped, the core revenue beat will be better, not necessarily for NII, but for the combination of the two. We don't know that yet, and it's not prudent to assume it yet, which is why we keep the NII projection to where it is and we keep the fee trajectory to where it is, except Q1 where we are above. The cost of risk is a significant positive. We see our portfolio performing better than expected. We have had to do nothing on overlays. We thought we would need to use them at some point for the time being, that point is far away. And so if I summarize, the significantly better first quarter in fees and cost and provision because we bundle provision with NII, looking at them separately, in our opinion, is not correct, brings us to do 2 things; one, I already made the quarter, so I'm better through the year, even if I am in the same trend line for the next 3 quarters. Two, I'm madly optimistic depending on the uncertainty of this environment. And if that optimism becomes confirmed by fact, those 3 things will continue to contribute further. If they don't, most of the beat is first quarter, partially fee, cost and provision; and the trading, I don't think there will be a repeat of a significant overperformance of trading of this quarter because a lot of things went in one direction. The volatility pushed, very hard, client-driven trading in hedges, the strategic portfolio hedged, crystallized some gain, which we may lose or not, and the treasury did well. So I would say, a long answer to say I think fee and cost plus provision are the main driver. Trading is a one-off, in my opinion, and is going to go back to the trend line. On M&A, using your word, political hostilities refocusing everywhere else. Firstly, I think I'm not saying something very new by saying that in the recent times, all governments have taken a much keener look and roll into M&A. You see that across Europe from Spain to Italy to Germany to Hungary, everywhere. So it is a fact of M&A. I think to an extent is a justified fact as government want to make sure the transaction are done in a way that support the economy and support people. And on that, I completely share the view. Maybe the implementation, we could have a different view of how we would implement to achieve that role. But that is a fact. And I would say that it is a fact in most, if not all the countries where we operate today and not only in Europe. So we have -- as we said from day 1, it is our job to identify M&A opportunity or inorganic investment opportunity in every market we operate and in the market we told you we're interested in. And we have. We have a list, they are analyzed. We know what they are. Why aren't we closing them? They're not in the best interest of our shareholders. When they become in the best interest in the shareholder, we will close them. If not, we will not. We do not have pressure to close M&A because our stand-alone trajectory is already well above the peer group and our valuation is below the peer group. So we have a lot of work to continue to demonstrate to our shareholders that we deserve to align, and we will perform better than peers. If that -- when that performance finishes, which at the moment, I do not see in the next 3 to 4 years, we may have pressure on M&A. But at the moment, we have none. So we look at M&A or an inorganic investment on a very cold basis .Do they strengthen our franchise and, and I underline the and, do they increase the value we create for our shareholders, risk adjusted? Some do, some don't, and that's where we are. And as we look at our share buyback, we will look at M&A, we will look at our inorganic option. You asked me to rank. Let me see if I can make back where you ask me to rank. I think I had local distribution, new markets and factories. Okay. So if I ranked, so this is if, we clear hurdles, if we clear hurdles, okay, so assuming they all return the same or risk-adjusted means that non-risk-adjusted any M&A or investment needs to return more than buying my own stock. I would say new market, meaning M&A -- geographic M&A, call it this way, in any market where we are or the one immediately close to us, as I have mentioned, Poland, more than once. Secondly, strengthen of our factories. Thirdly, buying back our own stock. And why is that? Because if I clear the hurdles, doing this investment and M&A will elongate the period in which we can add value. We think we have an unmatched blueprint to extract value from banks and from what we do. And if we have the opportunity to do it profitably, in the interest of our shareholders, we will. But at the same time, and I want to be very clear because I keep on saying that and maybe it's not getting through. I've done M&A for a long time, and I have seen massive destruction of value by management team and companies that put pressures by media, by short-term views, by speculation, do transaction and from the next day, they need to repair the damage for several years. I will not do that, and I'm very patient and calm and the Board is completely aligned. So we find the right transaction, we will do them faster than you can believe. We don't find them, we will execute our own plan.\nOperator: The next question is from Marco Nicolai, Jefferies.\nMarco Nicolai : So if I look at the headcount direction, this quarter, it declined about 1% year-on-year. So it seems this decline is somewhat stabilizing from larger decreases we had in the past. Although there also -- there were also perimeter changes in the last couple of quarters. So what trend are you expecting in headcount going forward? And any -- related to this on the cost base, any read across from the partnership with Google that you announced today? And secondly, on common equity Tier 1, the capital was stronger than expected this quarter. Can you please just give us more color on the 67 positive elements excluding this 23 basis from the FX hedge? And also, if we need to keep in mind anything for the next quarter beyond the organic capital generation and distributions?\nAndrea Orcel : Thank you, Marco. So let me take it first and then Stefano will complete. So we do not have a focus on FTE reduction, never did, never will. We have a focus on cost efficiencies. FTE reduction leads people to move core activities outside of the perimeter of the bank, and then say we have reduced FTEs as opposed to invest in their people and internalize activities that we push outside of the bank. So a lot of our cost reduction has been done by reinternalizing activities that were pushed before. Having said that, we have had significant number of people leaving on a net basis due to what is physiological in Central and Eastern Europe and retirements of people where we pay their old pass to pension because this bank had not touched certain categories for years and had not hired young people for years. As we hired young people, we were able to replenish our pyramidal age, and therefore, exit, let's say, more expensive people that were at the end of our career and the wish to exit, and reinvesting on younger people that were at the start of a career. So if you do that and you reinternalize, maybe your headcount does not decline as much as you would think, but the cost per head and the efficiency per head goes up materially. So we don't track FTE reduction. We track cost of HR reduction vis-a-vis what their efficiency is and we tracked non-HR cost. Another thing that you should consider is that we are not here to reduce cost 1 quarter, 2 quarters, 3 quarters, 4 quarters. We have been reducing cost for -- now I have lost count, but probably more than 10 quarters. Our objective is to have a grip on cost to keep it under control, to not let them deviate and focus on efficiency. I have no problem if I can grow twice as much if I need to let go on cost, but my cost to income ratio and our efficiency is what's driving it. It is also true that as of today, we are gradually shifting our attention on non-HR cost, which are one matter that all of us should look at because inflation is having a significant impact on those. So my general answer is, look at cost, we're going to keep them broadly in line, not one quarter but for the next 3 years. And that is a massive achievement, and we have a lot of variables that we need to look at. What is read across from Google partnership? I would say, like every other partnership like the MasterCard partnership and like many others we have done with Alpha, for example, these are not providers, distributor or client provider relationship, they are partnership. So with Google, we will together transform the bank. With MasterCard, we will together transform payment. With Alpha Bank, we will together create value from them distributing our products and we manufacturing them. So we want to do more of those. It creates an ecosystem and it creates the right motivation from our partners to see us successful and for us to see them successful. On the CET1, this -- and then I'll pass to Stefano. So we -- I would look at it that way. They're about 50 basis points that are -- I don't know if you want to call them one-off or you want to call them more volatile, which is why if you see, we have created a buffer in our excess capital. About half of those come from the ruble appreciation in Russia and the other half comes from the overall performance of our strategic portfolio including hedges, and I underline including hedges because hedges are an excellent things when things go badly, but they cost money when things go up. Now Monday morning quarterbacking, today, we would all like not to have hedges. But my job is to create consistency over time. Therefore, we are hedged versus we had a positive outcome, but not as positive as it could or would have been. As you have seen, our total capital has moved from 6.5% to 10%. But specifically because we have more volatile area in our capital generation, we have limited the one we are committing to return to you to EUR 7.5 billion keeping a buffer of EUR 2.5 billion. If we consolidate those performance and those risks go away or decline, there is EUR 2.5 billion that are sitting there to be used. And that's the total, but I will pass it with Stefano.\nStefano Porro : Thank you, Andrea. So adding a point on the reduction of the headcounts. Marco, you're referring to a reduction of the total headcounts in terms of FTEs of 1% year-on-year to consider the change in the perimeter. So it's important to have a look at that also when you look to the future because we had the change of Alpha Romania and Aion-Vodeno, so if you would adjust for these changes, the reduction of the FTEs would be year-on-year equal to minus 4%. Clearly, as highlighted by Andrea, we're looking to the trend of the overall cost, not just for the FTE, but you can assume that in order to be able to keep costs slightly down also in the course of the following years, excluding the effect from the perimeter, we will have to reduce also the headcount component, clearly, not at this path, we will keep on optimizing and a consequence 3 that, reducing also the headcounts component in future. With regards to the capital impact in the first quarter and more specifically in relation to the line -- to the part of the capital walk called PD Scenario and Other Items. So first of all, there is fundamentally no impact from the PD scenario, it's just, let's say, around 1 basis point. So that's not material. What is material is capital reserves, around 26 basis points out of that is the ruble appreciation, okay? Then we have around 10 basis points deriving from fair value through OCI reserves, so the reserve that we have related to the mark-to-market of bond investments and pension funds, okay? So this is positive for around 10 basis points. Then there are 2 other important elements. One is tax loss carryforward and intangibles. Deposit effect is around 15 basis points. Tax loss carryforward is related to the Italian perimeter. At the beginning of the year, we had around EUR 4 billion of recognized tax loss carryforward that are deducted from the capital. We will utilize this tax loss carryforward during the course of the next years. The total benefit of the capital for the future will be 120 basis points in the next 6 years. You can expect around something more than 25 basis points during the course of '25 from this utilization. The final point is in relation to threshold deduction, which is threshold deduction. We have some deduction connected to the investment -- to the significant investment in financial sector entities. During the quarter, the capital improvements was such that this threshold deduction went down and went down for an amount of around 15 basis points, 1-5. So wrapping up, 26 basis point is FX, ruble appreciation; 10 basis point is capital reserve, bonds, pension fund; 15 basis point, tax loss carryforward and intangible point; 15 basis point is this threshold deduction that I explained to you. In relation to 2025, you have asked if there is something more to be taken into consideration? The answer is yes, is the effect deriving from model changes. We had around 6 basis points during this quarter deriving from Basel. We will have model changes for an amount around EUR 8 billion during the course of the remaining quarters of this year. For the rest, it will be capital generation through the business and also including capital efficiency actions.\nOperator: The next question is from Delphine Lee, JPMorgan.\nDelphine Lee : The first one is on capital, just a clarification. Do you mind just giving us the impact of the mark-to-market of the strategic stake, so Commerzbank and Generali, any others that were significant? Just to understand a little bit the P&L impact on trading and what went through CET1. And my second question is -- sorry, just to come back on M&A. Could you just help us understand a little bit sort of what -- on the time line of the Banco BPM transaction, I mean, how should we think about it? And when do you think we'd be able to share a bit more? And what are the kind of main discussion points?\nAndrea Orcel : Okay. Thank you, Delphine. So capital, strategic portfolio. As we said, the impact, 25 basis points positive. Impact on trading, minus 40. Why minus 40? Because -- minus EUR 40 million sorry, minus EUR 40 million impact on trading, minus EUR 40 million. Why? Because part of a stake, the almost 10% we announced when we bought the stake from the government is not going for trading, is going through -- directly through equity. So we are hedged 100%, and the move of those hedge are 100%. So if everything goes up, the up from the part that is in our -- that goes to equity, you don't see it through trading, you see directly to capital, while the up of the -- all of the hedges -- well, the impact of all the hedges that in this case were negative, you see them in trading. So the hedges are only matching in the P&L, let's call it, rough-cut 3/4 of our underlying because 1 quarter -- sorry, 2/3 of our underlying because 1/3 goes directly to equity, and that's the asymmetry. And as we said, we had a good performance overall to capital. but we're not taking that as a performance that will stay there. It's more volatile. It depends on the market. So for the time being, we're happy we're hedged, we stay where we are. And then Stefano may add a few things on that, if there are. On BPM. So on BPM, let me recap, so we all see where we are. We made an offer in November. At the time of the offer, we were very clear that we felt there was uncertainty around Anima, and therefore, we were not going to pay for that uncertainty. And we would -- we were doing -- we were offering a 15% -- 20% when you include dividend, premium to shareholders and on undisturb on Anima. After that time, we obviously realize that given the timing of the offer of BPM, we would not be able to do the share buyback of EUR 3.6 billion until after closing BPM or not doing BPM. But if we do BPM, the shareholders of BPM get their share in the share buyback of UniCredit 2024. That's another 6%. Then after that, we realized that in order to align the asset quality of BPM to ours in Italy, we need to do another EUR 800 million of provisions, EUR 550 million after tax. That's another 6%. And then we got Anima, which we were very right to ignore because Anima, depending on what you want to evaluate, destroyed value between EUR 1 billion and EUR 1.7 billion in the bank. Indeed, if you look at their capital projection, now with Anima in, the share buyback is gone, and they need to climb back to a decent level of capital. Capital, excess capital that we were paying for in November and now was deployed at an 11% return, which if I did with my own share buybacks or with my own investment, I would derate. So if you put them all together and you can do the math, you find easily between a 40% to 50% premium to where they were before we made the offer. If you look at it in another way, you find that we are trading at more or less the same multiple, but if you adjust for the lower CET1 for the lower coverage of the loan book and for our excess capital, and EUR 3 billion of P&L buffer, but they do not have, you find that they're trading at more than 30% to 35% PE gap to us, which brings you back to a similar number. So we start from a situation where we have the right to evaluate the situation, to analyze what is happening because I would add another thing: when you buy a factory and that factory distributes through other banks, other banks' appetite to distribute the product of that factory usually goes down, not up. And therefore, we need to look at that. And we have time, we have a right to have time. So we were evaluating that situation until we got golden power. We got golden power, although its content are supposed to be secret. I understand they are widely public in the press. So you can make your own opinion on that. There are a number of elements in the Golden Power that are, in our opinion, not clear and not intended. We're trying to clarify them. We need to go through that before we take a definitive decision. So we will get either clarification or not. If it's not, we will need to make our own interpretation of what the golden power indicates. When we get all that, we will make a decision. But for the time being, we have no pressure. We have patience like on everything else, and we will wait.\nStefano Porro : So adding 2 elements to what Andrea just said on the strategic portfolio, i.e., all the exposure and the related hedging of Commerzbank and Generali. So the effects are some of them in P&L, top line, mainly in the trading, some of them through equity and some of them in risk-weighted assets. So the sum up of all this effect in the quarter brought to a positive capital contribution of around plus 25 basis points of Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. The overall risk-weighted asset consumption of this investment is something more than EUR 2 billion for, let's say, an overall capital absorption between 10 and 15 basis points.\nOperator: The next question is from Britta Schmidt, Autonomous Research.\nBritta Schmidt : Yes. On net interest income, I hear that your full year guidance is largely reiterated, maybe you can explain a little bit what drove the decline in Austria? And also with regards to the replication portfolio, I think you previously guided to 0 or possibly a negative impact in 2025, does that still stand? And then secondly, on the more than EUR 400 million benefits expected in net profit 2027, I think it's Slide 21 of the presentation, can you give a little bit of color as to how that would split across revenues and costs? And then also on the life insurance JVs, it says the merger is expected by 2026 completion by end of 2025, do you expect there to be any consolidation benefits in 2025 or will this now be 2026?\nStefano Porro : Yes. So in relation to the net interest income trends. So net interest income trend of Austria has been impacted from one, an overall trend of customer rate on the asset side and trend on the deposit rate on the deposit side. In relation to the customer rate on the deposit side, do consider that there was a reduction of the pass-through, but the reduction of the pass-through will take further because, especially in Germany and Austria, it takes time in order to reprice down because we do have also term deposits. . So all in all, the expectation is that the net interest income trend should improve during the course of 2025. The more we are able to reprice down on the deposit through the reduction of the rate on term deposit and we get more traction in terms of lending trend. Having said that, in relation to the lending trend dynamic, while we are expecting an increase of the lending trend for the group in terms of stock, something more than 1% of increase of the stock of loans during the course of this year, such an improvement will come mainly from Central Eastern Europe. We will have a slight improvement around 1% year-on-year from Italy and Austria and slightly down in Germany. So the trend of Austria in terms of net interest income will be better during the course of final part of the year and especially during the course of 2026. In relation to the replicating portfolio, the replicating portfolio has been increased during the course of this quarter. So if we look at the end of the quarter in comparison with the end of the year is up EUR 7 billion. The average is slightly below EUR 180 billion and for an average duration of around 5. The yield is around 1.2%. The contribution in the next 3 years, simply deriving from the rolling of the replicating portfolio, so between '27 if you look in comparing with net interest income from replicating of '24 is around EUR 500 million. That's backloaded, so it's not front loaded with the majority of the contribution in '26 and especially in '27. With regard to the consolidation. So in relation to the consolidation, we have mentioned the effect deriving from Alpha and Aion-Vodeno. So if you look in relation -- in terms of change of perimeter, so that is not a meaningful impact from a consolidation standpoint. The majority of the synergies in relation to Alpha Romania will come second part of this year and next year. The cost base of Alpha Romania is around EUR 100 million. So if you need to take this into consideration, do consider EUR 100 million with the synergies that will kick in second part of the year and especially last year. So the cost base that we'll have from Alpha Romania next year will be lower than a base for a year that you can consider equal to EUR 100 million. In relation to the -- I mean, you mentioned the EUR 400 million, right, so in 2027, deriving from the different perimeter, i.e., from the insurance around EUR 100 million; from Alpha Romania around EUR 100 million; and from Aion-Vodeno that is more than EUR 200 million. So in relation to this, I believe that it's important for you to take into consideration the effect that are very, very much differentiated. So if you consider the current cost base for this year, the current cost base for this year deriving from the sum up of this perimeter will be around EUR 250 million for a revenue base that will be around EUR 400 million. This will be progressively going up with synergies already in '25 and '26 from insurance and from Alpha while the progression will be more backloaded if you want from Aion-Vodeno standpoint in the sense that you can expect a contribution equal fundamentally to the bottom line of 0 this year, progressively going up, but with definitely a higher amount in 2027.\nOperator: The next question is from Pamela Zuluaga, Morgan Stanley.\nPamela Zuluaga : The first one is around excess capital. You said that you're not in any pressure to do M&A in the following 3 to 4 years at least. With that in mind, how are you thinking about excess capital and your commitment to address it by 2027? Will you begin distributing some of the excess every year from now on? Or maybe is the target for 12.5%, 13% CET1 ratio further pushed beyond 2027? And the second one is a follow-on -- so follow-up, sorry, on your comments around NII before. You flagged that you had a lower pass-through this quarter versus Q4 2024. Did you already anticipate this positive trend on your NII guidance of moderate decline year-on-year? Or is there upside to your expectations if pass-through indeed continues falling?\nAndrea Orcel : Okay. So on excess capital, our commitment remains the same. So we will return our excess capital above 13% CET1 by the end of 2027, that does not change. What I said on M&A is no pressure just to compare it to the widespread belief that if one launch an offer or buys a stake, one needs to buy at any cost and at any condition of the transaction. We are not bound to do that. If we can, and I responded to, I think, Andrea Filtri's first question. If we have the conditions that are right, we will do M&A above and beyond share buybacks, just because from a return standpoint, it makes sense. But if from a return standpoint, it doesn't make sense for our shareholders, we will not. So in order to answer your question, I think the excess capital above 13% where we keep an appropriate buffer that buffer may reduce if some of the volatile elements, either eliminate or addressed and therefore, the capital may go up from that level, we will return it by '27 or profitably employed by '27, profitably employed, it means making inorganic investment or acquisition that clear the hurdle of our share buyback and all the other metrics that we have given again and again and again. So the probability that it goes in M&A as opposed to share buyback depends on the possibility to do transactions that clear our hurdles and add more value to our shareholders than buying our stock back. It's completely linked to that, and we will be either very fast in doing them or not doing them, depending if we get that or not. On the second, I'll pass to Stefano.\nStefano Porro : Yes. So in relation to net interest income, so some ingredients, which are our assumption rates wise, so we're expecting to have a deposit facility rate of ECB at -- so below 2% at 175 by the summer, meaning that the exit Euribor will be below 2% clearly by year-end. So we are currently assuming 1.8%. Overall, average Euribor for the year at 2.1%, which is the net interest income sensitivity, so plus/minus 50 basis point Euribor is plus/minus EUR 300 million. The deposit pass-through sensitivity is 1 percentage point is EUR 100 million, which are our assumption in terms of the deposit pass-through. We closed the deposit pass-through for the group, excluding Russia, is around 33%, 3-3, and we were at 34% same perimeter at the end of Q4. We are currently assuming to be slightly better. So we are currently assuming to be at around 32%. So with this assumption, we are expecting to have a moderate reduction of the net interest income as guided for high single digit. So it's something more than the mid-single digit. Clearly, if they pass through, reduction will be better than what we are assuming, as I told you before, a relation to Austria and Germany, we are currently assuming a reduction of the pass-through in Austria and Germany, for every percentage point net interest income can be better on an annual basis for around EUR 100 million. So in compared with our assumption, if this will happen, that can be a tailwind.\nOperator: So this was our last question, I turn the conference back to the management for any closing remarks.\nAndrea Orcel : Thank you very much for your time, and we'll see many of you during the road show. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining. The conference is now over, and you may disconnect your telephones.",

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel ",
        "text": "Good morning. Before I take you through our results, strategy and prospects, I would like to take this opportunity to thank, once again, our people, the true engine of UniCredit, whose passion, dedication, hard work and excellence make this possible quarter after quarter. Q1 2025 marks the beginning of Phase 2 of UniCredit Unlocked, unlocking acceleration. While we continue to optimize our operating model, we are now focused on fully leveraging our structural commercial strengths to drive top line growth. This quarter's result, well ahead of our plan across all KPIs, confirm the resilience of our core business, the depth of our transformation and the strength of our future trajectory. Our performance is anchored on 3 pillars. First, financial strengths. Q1 marks the best quarter in our history, solidifying our record of quality delivering across all KPIs, building a significant buffer to improve our own projection for 2025 while increasing our lines of defense. This meaningfully differentiates us our present and expected future performance versus that of our peers. Second, structural strengths. We operate a unique pan-European platform, diversified across countries, client segments and business lines. This gives us reach and resilience, allowing us to reallocate capital towards the highest return opportunities while absorbing local volatility and delivering both quality growth and distributions. Third, our ever-evolving transformation. Between '21 and '24, we focused on redesigning and streamlining our operating machine, while rebuilding and reigniting our commercial one. We are now shifting to acceleration, optimizing our operating machine while accelerating our commercial machine by targeting the right geographies, the right client segments, the right channels and the right products. While the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, our disciplined execution and solid foundation give us confidence. Our previous guidance included softer net operating profit through '25 due to normalizing rates and cost of risk, with improvement weighted towards Q4, also due to lesser nonoperating charges. This, along with returning excess capital, was expected to keep net income and return on tangible equity broadly in line with '24 and ensure higher distributions than '24. That trajectory for the next 3 quarters remains unchanged. However, our outperformance in Q1 across nonoperating profit, net income, return on tangible equity and organic capital generation allows us to upgrade our 2025 guidance. We now expect to exceed '24 net income and RoTE with distribution above last year by more than initially anticipated, benefited from higher net profit growth. Should this momentum continue into Q2 and early Q3, we will consider further upgrades to our guidance. Our ambitions for '26-'27 and beyond are unchanged, but we approach them with even greater confidence. This is a story of organic quality profitable growth and distribution unmatched in Europe, strengthened by selective inorganic opportunities but will only be pursued if they enhance our already best-in-class stand-alone case. Q1 '25 marked a historic milestone for UniCredit. We delivered record results across all KPIs, further improved their quality and further strengthened our capital, asset quality, liquidity and lines of defense. Net revenue increased 3.2% with excellent fee generation more than compensating net NII decline, all further boosted by trading. NII RoAC increased to 20%, best-in-class. Fees grew to 36% of total revenues, while on their way to 40%. We reduced cost by 1.3% at constant perimeter, almost compensating the impact from first-time consolidation; reducing our stated cost-to-income ratio to 35.4%, beating peers by a significant margin. We grew net revenue over RWAs to 9.2%, while absorbing the bulk impact, generating EUR 3.1 billion of capital organically and EUR 5.3 billion overall. Net profit increased 8.3% to EUR 2.8 billion at an industry record 22% return on tangible equity, unadjusted from our significant excess capital. Adjusted for that excess capital at 13% CET1, our return on tangible equity would have been 26%. Our profitable growth allowed us to offset the impact from Basel, accrue 100% of net income in distribution while increasing our CET1 ratio to 16.1%, 16.6%, excluding the accrued SBB. Our per share growth is even more impressive. EPS, up 18%. Dividend per share, up 46%, tangible book per share, up 17%, including dividends. We achieved Q1 results while maintaining our EUR 3 billion buffers intact, EUR 1.3 billion nonoperating items and EUR 1.7 billion of overlays, and increasing NPE coverage by 1 percentage point and our excess capital to EUR 8.5 billion to EUR 10 billion or circa EUR 7.5 billion, excluding the more volatile elements. So we stand prepared for the future. This is the result of a deliberate strategic transformation, which balances delivering in the short term with continued investments supporting long-term performance. This position UniCredit as a benchmark for banking. We grew our net revenues by 3.2% year-on-year and 14.6% quarter-on-quarter without compromising quality, as proven by strong fee growth more than offsetting expected NII decline. Combined net NII and fee grew 1.6% year-on-year. Trading contribution continues to be positive, as we offer essential hedging to our clients in FX, in rates and commodities, leveraging our unique pan-European network. 2/3 of our trading was client-driven in that area with the remainder resulting from strong performance of our treasury and investment portfolio. Cost of risk remained benign at 8 basis points. NII showed resilient profitability driven by positive margins and benign cost of risk. UniCredit maintained discipline even as other banks, particularly M&A targets, pushed for higher volumes and drove pricing to value-destructive levels. Our unwavering focus on EVA-positive volumes over volumes at any cost is delivering as our net NII trajectory is better than the sector, while its profitability is significantly greater, reaching a best-in-class RoAC of 20%. We continue to have excellent pass-through management with the average in the quarter down 1.3 percentage points to 32.6%. Magda Palczynska UniCredit S.p.A. \u2013 Head of Group Investor Relations We're just going to pause the call for 5 minutes while the audio is resolved. Sorry, just a moment, please. Okay. Thank you, everyone. We'll restart. Apologies for that."

        "text": "Apologies. We are on Slide 4 and for anything you missed in the first part of the presentation, we'll take questions later. So we start from Slide 4. We grew our net revenues by 3.2% year-on-year and 14.6% Q-on-Q without compromising quality, as proven by strong fee growth, more than offsetting expected NII decline. Combined net NII and fees grew 1.6% year-on-year. Trading contribution continues to be positive as we offer essential hedging to our clients in FX, rates and commodities, leveraging our unique pan-European network. 2/3 of our trading was client-driven with the remainder resulting from strong performance of our treasury and investment portfolio. Cost of risk remains benign at 8 basis points. NII showed resilient profitability, driven by positive margin and benign cost of risk. UniCredit maintained discipline even as other banks, particularly M&A targets, pushed for higher volumes and drove pricing to value-destructive levels. Our unwavering focus on EVA-positive volumes over volumes at any cost is delivering as our net NII trajectory is better than the sector, while its profitability is significantly greater, reaching a best-in-class return on average equity of 20%. We continue to have excellent pass-through management with the average of -- in the quarter down 1.3 percentage points to 32.6%. Asset quality remains strong and stable. Our gross and net NPE ratio remained respectively at 2.6% and 1.4% with coverage increasing 1 percentage point Q-on-Q to 47%. Cost of risk remains structurally low at 8 basis points, broadly flat versus the first quarter of '24 and down significantly on Q4 due to the prudent approach we took to further reinforce our strong coverage on a number of files. While we increased coverage, we're still benefiting from write-backs, confirming quality origination and conservative provisioning. We maintain our EUR 1.7 billion overlays impact. They will act as a buffer against any potential deterioration in asset quality. No other institution has this level of absolute and relative overlays and has delivered this benign cost of risk without ever touching them, but rather increasing them. Our default rate is down to 0.9%. Our fee income reached a new record, growing 8.2% year-on-year and remarkable 16.5% quarter-on-quarter. Of particular note is the breadth of this growth across fee category and regions. Investment-related fees rose 13% year-on-year, insurance 5%, with non-life up 14%. Payment and current account, 1%; advisory and financing 4%; client hedging fees up 25%. Fees in Italy increased 7.8%; Germany, 7%, excluding financing fees coming from very high base; Austria, 8.5%; and Central and Eastern Europe, 16.5%. The strength and diversification is by design. It reflects our strategic focus on building factories that can deliver resilient capital-light revenues across all regions, even in uncertain market conditions. Our fee to revenue ratio climbed to 36%, a top-tier level among European fee -- peers. Our cost-income ratio improved to 35.4%, the best in our peer group, driven by disciplined cost management, combined with targeted streamlining. At constant perimeter, cost decreased 1.3% year-on-year, while maintaining our level of investment in our people, in our business and in our technology. Stated costs increased 0.6% year-on-year due to our first time consolidation of Aion-Vodeno and Alpha Bank Romania, which currently have cost-income ratios far above group average. As we fully unlock their revenue-generating potential, they will meaningfully contribute to our future growth and operational efficiency. This quarter, UniCredit generated EUR 3.1 billion of capital organically and EUR 5.3 billion or 190 basis points overall. This absorbed the Basel impact of circa 60 basis points, 20 basis points less than originally anticipated. The distribution accrual of 100 basis points or 100% of the EUR 2.8 billion net profit, while further increasing our CET1 ratio 27 basis points to 16.1%. Excluding the share buyback accrual, CET1 ratio would stand at 16.6%. Our current CET1 ratio implies a buffer of EUR 8.5 billion to EUR 10 billion, so between 313 and 363 basis points above our 12.5% to 13% CET1 ratio target. This is EUR 1 billion to EUR 2.5 billion above what we prudently define as our excess capital that now stand at circa EUR 7.5 billion. The difference includes both a proven buffer for other regulatory headwinds for more volatile items such as the gain from strategic investment, net of hedging and from Russia. We have the highest level of excess capital in the peer group. This is a testament to the strength of our business model, highly profitable, highly capital efficient and able to fund growth, best-in-class distribution and regulatory requirement simultaneously. Our capital discipline gives us both certainty and strategic optionality, whether for organic investment, share buybacks or potential inorganic investment. Our liquidity position is strong and sustainable. Our LCR and SFR above 140% and 125%, respectively, are sound and well above our peer average. Our loans-to-deposit ratio stands at 87%, notwithstanding our focus on the deposit pass-through, well below 100%. In general, a higher loan-to-deposit ratio, not only requires relying on more expensive source of funding, but also correlates with increased liquidity risk, particularly during period of market stress or geopolitical uncertainty. We have reinforced our European leadership across all KPIs, widening the gap versus peers. The high-quality revenue growth, coupled with best-in-class operating and capital efficiency leads to unmatched profitability and capital generation. Our 22% return on tangible equity is 7 percentage points higher than the average of our peers. It would be even higher if we normalize for our excess capital relative to them. We generate more than twice the capital organically than the average of our peers. We're confident we can widen this gap further. Our strengths and lines of defense, including our excess capital, are unmatched and derisk or boost our profitability and distribution going forward. Our structural advantages and the way we are leveraging them are the foundational elements of our success. We operate a truly pan-European franchise that leverages scale with local depth. Our geographic footprint is balanced across 4 powerful regions: Italy, Germany, Austria and Central and Eastern Europe. This footprint allows us to deliver quality profitable growth and distribution regardless of local volatility. Our client base is well balanced between attractive SME, affluent and private clients and large corporate mass market clients that we approach differently. We leverage common platform and scale while tailoring products to each client segment. Our business mix is supported by group factories that deliver best-in-class product tailored for local clients' needs. What we are seeing now is the real power of convergence across our regions and product factories, increasingly working together to create synergies and reinforcing each other's strengths. Let me move to our regions. In Italy, our franchise continued to be market-leading by a wide margin across sustainable profitability, efficiency and capital generation. It is UniCredit quality earnings powerhouse, delivering impressive financial results as our transformation evolves from unlocking value to accelerating profitable growth. Gross revenues grew 1.4% to EUR 3 billion. Net revenue, 2.9%, driven by very strong fees up 8%, 2 percentage points more than each of our 2 Italian peers, more than offsetting a net NII decline of 1.6%, well below that of our 2 Italian peers. Our continued focus on margin rather than volume led to the increase of our NII ROAC to 25%, significantly above peers. Fee growth was well diversified with standout performance of our investment and non-life insurance fees. Our fee to revenue ratio in Italy reached a top-tier 42%. We maintained a low cost of risk at 26 basis points, down 7 points year-on-year, reinforcing coverage and without touching our overlays. Our gross and net NPE ratio remained at 2.7% and 1.5%, respectively, with increasing coverage Q-on-Q. However, our net NPE ratio adjusted for exposure covered by state guarantees with a 100% enforcement success rate, unlike many other banks, would drop to 0.9% and be almost entirely covered by our Italian overlays. Effectively, we're almost a 0 net NPE bank in Italy. Operational efficiency improved further to 32%. Costs were down 2.2% in spite of the continued investment in our people, business and technology. Capital efficiency improved with net revenue to RWA of 11.3%, up almost 1 percentage point year-on-year. The gap with the first and the third Italian bank increased to 0.5 percentage points and 2.5 percentage points, respectively. Profit before tax rose 70% year-on-year to EUR 1.9 billion, RoAC reached 37%, up 6 percentage points, the best in Italy by a margin. Organic capital generation reached EUR 1.6 billion, the best in Italy by a margin. As such, UniCredit was recognized as the best bank in Italy by IFR and the Global Finance Awards in 2025. Our continued investment in and support of development of our people through UniCredit Corporate University provides them with new challenges, new opportunities and career longevity. We continue to invest in technology to further improve client experience. Our recently introduced UCX SME Lending platform provides a fully digital end-to-end lending journey for SMEs, side-by-side with UCX consumers for family. We supported a number of innovative large corporate deals providing financial backing and strategic solution, reinforcing our role in enhancing the long-term competitiveness and resilience of core Italian companies. In the quarter, we facilitated over EUR 4.4 billion in financing in support of Italian SME client alone, as we target growth in this segment. Our dedication to Italy is further underscored by the EUR 35 billion invested to date in UniCredit per Italia that remains unmatched, and our Italian government bond exposure that account for 64% of our Italian legal entity sovereign exposure above our Italian competitor. These bonds currently have a positive mark-to-market value, and we have benefited from this position throughout the cycle. Germany. Our German bank continues to be the best performing in the country, increasing the gap versus peer. It is one of the 2 key anchors for the group and continues to deliver impressive financial results as its transformation evolves from unlocking value to accelerating profitable quality growth. Gross revenues grew 3.8% year-on-year to EUR 1.5 billion. Net revenue grew 6.3% without releasing any overlays, with fees and trading mostly client-driven, more than offsetting the 2.5% decline in net NII. As previously indicated, NII in Germany is affected by the client-driven increase in trading volume, as we booked trading-related funding cost in NII and increase in rates and/or volumes negatively impact NII while benefiting trading by an equal amount. When rates and volume decline, the opposite happens. As such, gross NII and net NII would have been up, respectively, 1% and 6% with trading up only 14%, assuming flat trading volume year-on-year. This performance is best-in-class in the country. Our 23% NII RoAC also remain the best-in-class in the country, increasing our lead versus our competitors as we focus on lending being significantly above our cost of equity in its own right. Fees adjusted for financing fees are up 7% driven by investment, up 7%; insurance, up 11%; and client hedging, up 11%. The decline in financing fees masked that growth as they normalize from a very strong base in Q1 2024. Cost of risk is down to 11 basis points with no usage of overlays. Our NPE ratio is stable at 2.2% with proven coverage improving. Operational efficiency improved further to 36%, widening the gap versus our closest competitor peer by 3 percentage points to 20 percentage points. Costs were down 1.9%, despite significant investment in technology and people. Capital efficiency improved further with net revenue over RWA of 8.7%, almost 1 percentage point higher year-on-year. Profit before tax rose 12% to EUR 0.9 billion compared to a decline at our closest peer. RoAC ended above 26%, up 3.7 percentage points over the year, the best in Germany, widening the gap to almost 2x our closest peers. As a result, organic capital generation reached EUR 800 million, investing in and for all our stakeholder within Germany is at the core of how we operate. We are the employer of choice with top employer certification for the 15th consecutive quarter. We achieved the highest NPS score among Mittelstand banks. A Germany's leading provider of FX hedging, together with those on recent commodities, we help protect the industry from volatility. We have been leading the defense and technology start-up sector and our German bank is well positioned to support this industry further. We hold a substantial share of our legal entity treasury portfolio in Germany, sub-sovereign bonds, a clear sign of our commitment to supporting regional resilience and public priorities. Austria. Our Austrian bank continues to be the best performing bank among our Austrian peers. It is one of the 2 key anchors for the group and continues to deliver impressive financial results, as its transformation evolves from unlocking value to accelerating profitable growth. Gross revenue grew 1.9% to EUR 700 million, driven by strong fees, up 8.5%, with together with dividends more than offset the 8% NII decline. Fee growth was driven by investments, plus 19%; and insurance, plus 96%, leading to a 33% fee to revenue, the highest in the country. Cost of risk remained positive due to repayments in performing loans with gross provision beginning to normalize. Operational efficiency remained at 39% with cost up 3.3% due to wage drift and a change in operating model that benefited the group but disadvantaged Austria due to its raising VAT. We continue to significantly invest in technology and people. Our capital efficiency remained strong with net revenue over RWA at 7%, notwithstanding the 8.5% increase in RWAs, mainly due to Basel, partially offset by mitigating actions. Profit before tax declined 4.4% when adjusting for VAT accounting and higher bank levy versus 8.2% stated. RoAC remained high at 24.4%, 25.8% adjusted, the best among Austrian banks. Organic capital generation reached EUR 400 million. Investing in and for all our stakeholders within Austria is at the core of how we operate. We were recognized as a top employer '25, extending green benefit and achieving the family-friendly employer certification for the sixth consecutive year. We advanced our technology initiatives, launching new self-issued credit cards, enhancing our mobile banking app with chatbot functionality. Central and Eastern Europe. Our Central and Eastern Europe franchise continues to be the most profitable and efficient in the region. It is the growth engine of the group and continues to deliver impressive financial results as its transformation evolves from unlocking value to accelerating profitable growth. Gross revenues grew 5% year-on-year to EUR 1.2 billion, driven by strong fees, up 17% and NII up 1.5%. Alpha Bank first-time consolidation, partially compensated for the significant drag of Hungary. The quality of our NII remains unmatched in the region, with NII RoAC at 25%. While competitors chase volume, we are maintaining discipline without sacrificing market share. The strong fee performance was broad-based and led to an increase of our fees to revenue ratio of 3 percentage points to 28%. Cost of risk remained positive due to repayment in performing loans with gross provision beginning to normalize. Operational efficiency remained best-in-class at 34% cost-income ratio, 32.9% excluding Alpha Romania. Costs were up 3.9%, excluding Alpha Romania, 13.8% stated, including Alpha Romania. We continue to significantly invest in technology and people. Our capital efficiency remains best-in-class with net revenue over RWA of 8.6% and stable despite an 8% increase in RWAs due to the Alpha merger and Basel impact. Profit before tax was up 1%, 4%, excluding Hungary. RoAC remained excellent at 26%, 30% excluding Hungary. Organic capital generation reached EUR 600 million. We advanced our technology initiatives with fast and easy onboarding for small corporates in Romania and faster micro business loan approvals in Serbia. Russia. We continue to work towards an accelerated ordinary wind-down of Russia, always within both the letter and the spirit of the complex legal, regulatory and sanction limitation. Our '25 targets communicated in the first half of '24 have already been reached last year. To better appreciate the impact of our action, we will comment the trends at constant foreign exchange starting Q1 2022. Local deposits declined to EUR 1.5 billion, minus 82% and further down 7% Q-on-Q. Net local loans declined to EUR 1 billion, minus 86% and further down 20% Q-on-Q. Cross-border lending declined 94% to date, and we reached practically 0 in Q3. Cross-border payments declined 70% to below EUR 8 billion per quarter and a further down 20% this quarter. We are now almost exclusively in euros and U.S. dollar. We have reduced the capital impact of a full write-down of Russia from circa 130 basis points on a 14% CET1 to circa 69 basis points on a 16.1% CET1 and maintain buffer in our excess capital to cover that. The 22 basis points increase versus previous quarter is solely due to ruble appreciation. We are compliant with applicable ECB targets and aim to continue our business compression in Russia, including a full orderly exit from the retail business by first half 2026. Product factories. Our product factories continue to drive differentiated quality growth. They delivered EUR 3.1 billion in gross revenues, up 7% year-on-year, with more than 67% of that coming from fees. Individual Solutions grew 9%, driven by Investment up 13% and Nonlife Insurance up 10%. One markets, assets under management reached EUR 18 billion, well ahead of plan, with our own managed fund sales increasing by more than 50%. We are well on our way to increasing value chain retention to more than 80% by internalizing and accelerating sales of our own products. This will provide Alpha growth above and beyond the market. Corporate Solutions grew 8% with fees up 13%, driven by Advisory and Financing and Client Risk Management. Client Risk Management grew 24%, testament to the value we add in supporting clients and the overall economy in volatile and uncertain markets. Our model is scalable, capital-light, provides value and is integrated across geographies. These factories are not only revenue generator through continued innovation and margin expansion, they are also critical in supporting clients and cementing their loyalty. They will continue to be a critical part of our unlocking acceleration strategy through 2027 and beyond. Q1 2025 marks the inflection point in our UniCredit Unlocked transformation journey. Between '21 and '24, we successfully unlocked trapped value by redesigning and streamlining our operating machine while rebuilding and reigniting our commercial machine. This allowed us to grow net profit significantly more than our peers, 2x in our calculation. We have already shifted gear from unlocking trapped potential to unlocking acceleration. In Phase 2 of our strategy, we will optimize our operating machine and further accelerate our commercial one. Despite industry headwinds, we are confident to deliver on our ambition of circa EUR 10 billion net profit at over 17% return on tangible equity by '27 and to grow further from that base as macro normalizes in the outer years. The impact from investment, both past, yet to fully crystallize and future, will build on our structural advantages and ensure further value creation. In the next 3 years, we will finalize unlocking trapped potential. We will continue to simplify, delay, streamline and change the way of working. We will finalize taking back control, boost investment in targeted technology and data enhancement and move into modernization, all to better support both our people and clients' journeys. We will complete the re-internalization of our product factories, most notably insurance already in Q2 and strengthen the connectivity between them and the client through increasingly digitalized and integrated channels and motivated network. In parallel, we are accelerating our top line growth with differentiated strategies per client segments and per geography. The aim is not just growth but targeted profitable growth with products that match client needs; distribution channel that puts choice in clients' hands; and data that powers personalization at scale. Our people and culture will continue to be central with sustained investment in empowerment, supported by simplification of processes and way of working and professional development delivered through Unicredit Corporate University. We are building not just a bigger bank, but a faster, more agile, more client-centric one, fully aligned with our structural strengths and long-term ambition. These steps ensure that every euro we invest translate into structured long-term value creation for our clients, for our shareholders, for our people and for our community with no waste. Our organic accelerator are already delivering, but their contribution will meaningfully increase in the years ahead. Initiatives like the internalization of our life insurance, the Alpha Bank integration in Romania, the very successful partnership with Alpha Bank in Greece and scaling up Aion-Vodeno are expected to contribute over EUR 400 million in additional net profit by 2027. This initiative will not only more than offset the compression of lower earnings from Russia, but also substantially improve the quality of our earnings and the growth potential after that. Aion-Vodeno allows us to profitably enter new markets such as retail and SMEs in Poland, where we signed up our first corporate deal. We are also expanding in Western Europe through a mobile-first model with regulatory applications underway. Banking-as-a-serving is scaling supported by a EUR 100 million capital increase from the group. In Romania, we've doubled our retail market share and added EUR 50 million in Q1 revenues alone. In Greece, we have successfully -- partners in trade finance, international payment and investment product with distribution of our One market funds well on its way to reach EUR 1 billion. These are in projection. They are real tangible growth levers already producing results. They enhanced revenue quality, support profitability and future-proof our earnings trajectory. Today, we have also announced another important milestone in our transformation journey. We are partnering with Google to accelerate our transformation, moving our application to cloud. This is a 360-degree partnership, well in line with our approach to build up a group ecosystem of best-in-class partners. It's a deep co-invested collaboration that is set to redefine how we operate, compete and innovate. Through Google, we are migrating our core system, our data and application to cloud, a move that will improve agility, reduce legacy complexity and enhance security. The migration is fully funded, delivering financial returns from day 1, while also decommissioning costly legacy infrastructure. On that basis, we maintain all of our cost commitments. Finally, this partnership goes well beyond technology. Google Cloud is committed to supporting UniCredit's people development, embedding a new way of working and training to best adopt cutting-edge AI and analytics. Google also offers us new business opportunity, leveraging their ecosystem for several services. Guidance. Thanks to a record-breaking first quarter, the transformation levers that drove it and our increased lines of defense, we're now upgrading our guidance for the full year 2025 to over EUR 9.3 billion at a return on tangible equity above 17%. We are, for now, maintaining the same conservative outlook for the rest of the year and expect the coming quarters to moderate with a decrease in net operating profit on a year-over-year basis, driven by an NII decline for the year, but we still expect to be above mid-single digits. We, however, now expect net revenues to end up better than originally anticipated at circa EUR 23.5 billion, driven by stronger Q1 and a more benign cost of risk for the year. Our confirmed guidance on cost will lead to a lower NOP that will be compensated by the significant reduction in nonoperating charges in Q4, all leading to the net profit and return on tangible equity guidance above. Depending on the actual performance of the business in Q2 and the beginning of Q3, there may be scope for further improve of our guidance. Distribution. We'll still exceed those in '24 and should further benefit from an increased net profit and organic capital generation. We reaffirm our '27 ambition, EUR 10 billion in net profit with return on tangible equity above 17% with annual distribution in excess of '24 for each one of the next 3 years. Our confidence is based on our financial strengths, a transformation leveraging our structural advantages, protected or propelled by our lines of defense. As we close, let me reiterate what this quarter represents. This is the best quarter in UniCredit's history, and it is not a one-off. It is the culmination of 17 quarters of profitable growth and progression through disciplined transformation from streamlining our operation to reigniting our commercial engine and ensuring our bank has a sustainable growing performance in the future. Every slide we've reviewed today points to a business that is outperforming peers' and our own expectations. We grow sustainably, while improving the quality of such growth. We lead on profitability, we lead on efficiency, we lead on capital generation and we lead on distributions. Our vision is clear. Our strategy is working. Our execution is disciplined. We have more value to unlock and more lines of defense to protect or propel us than any other peer. Looking ahead, we are focused on acceleration, leveraging our platform, scaling our products and unlocking further value through organic growth and selective strategic moves. We have inorganic possibilities in each one of our markets, some are visible, some are not. All can be closed by us, but we will close only those that add value to all of our stakeholders and, in particular, to our own shareholders. We are proud of what we've achieved and even more confident about what's to come. We're excited about our unmatched stand-alone profitable growth and distribution story. The resiliency and growth of our earnings and dividend per share trajectory are evident and superior to boast the average of the sector and those of peers with the highest valuation. The combination of these and the level of our current valuation, even before considering our significant lines of defense, makes our investment case compelling. Thank you very much, and we're now open to questions."

        "text": "I've got 2. First, on guidance. How much of the potential upward revision of guidance on net revenues is from provisions and trading and how much from fees and costs? The second, inevitably, on M&A. The press report you're potentially reconsidering, the [indiscernible] that the Commerce Bank option would face similar political hostilities in Italy and that you could consider refocusing elsewhere. Can you help us make sense of this, please? If you put generic strategic objectives and you rank them according to the following, give us an idea of how you would rank them: first, fostering local distribution; secondly, expanding distribution to new markets; third, fostering or recomposing product factories and wealth management distribution."

      {
        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel ",
        "text": "Sorry, just trying to keep up, Andrea. Okay. So guidance. Let's put it this way. This quarter, you can take consensus, we can take our own expectation. We are EUR 400 million to EUR 500 million of net profit ahead of where everybody expected us to be. Those EUR 400 million to EUR 500 million of net profit are due to the following factors: a significant beat on core revenues with fees doing significantly better than we expected and NII doing exactly as we expected. Secondly, trading that was benign. And this trading benign, as we said, was linked to 2 pieces. One, the support of clients through our client risk management in FX rates and commodities, but is up 25% and is booked mostly there. And secondly, treasury and strategic portfolio performance. So finally, we had cost a little bit better than expected, cost of risk significantly better than expected and that takes you to the bottom line. So to answer your question, I would say the way we look at it is, if I take fee plus NII, the dynamic for the year will be better just because I have had a Q1 that is better and I'm maintaining my expectation for the next 3 quarters. I have also said that we may increase our guidance further. And the reason why we haven't gone further now is because we want to see in such a volatile environment what happens. But if some of the trends we're seeing are capped, the core revenue beat will be better, not necessarily for NII, but for the combination of the two. We don't know that yet, and it's not prudent to assume it yet, which is why we keep the NII projection to where it is and we keep the fee trajectory to where it is, except Q1 where we are above. The cost of risk is a significant positive. We see our portfolio performing better than expected. We have had to do nothing on overlays. We thought we would need to use them at some point for the time being, that point is far away. And so if I summarize, the significantly better first quarter in fees and cost and provision because we bundle provision with NII, looking at them separately, in our opinion, is not correct, brings us to do 2 things; one, I already made the quarter, so I'm better through the year, even if I am in the same trend line for the next 3 quarters. Two, I'm madly optimistic depending on the uncertainty of this environment. And if that optimism becomes confirmed by fact, those 3 things will continue to contribute further. If they don't, most of the beat is first quarter, partially fee, cost and provision; and the trading, I don't think there will be a repeat of a significant overperformance of trading of this quarter because a lot of things went in one direction. The volatility pushed, very hard, client-driven trading in hedges, the strategic portfolio hedged, crystallized some gain, which we may lose or not, and the treasury did well. So I would say, a long answer to say I think fee and cost plus provision are the main driver. Trading is a one-off, in my opinion, and is going to go back to the trend line. On M&A, using your word, political hostilities refocusing everywhere else. Firstly, I think I'm not saying something very new by saying that in the recent times, all governments have taken a much keener look and roll into M&A. You see that across Europe from Spain to Italy to Germany to Hungary, everywhere. So it is a fact of M&A. I think to an extent is a justified fact as government want to make sure the transaction are done in a way that support the economy and support people. And on that, I completely share the view. Maybe the implementation, we could have a different view of how we would implement to achieve that role. But that is a fact. And I would say that it is a fact in most, if not all the countries where we operate today and not only in Europe. So we have -- as we said from day 1, it is our job to identify M&A opportunity or inorganic investment opportunity in every market we operate and in the market we told you we're interested in. And we have. We have a list, they are analyzed. We know what they are. Why aren't we closing them? They're not in the best interest of our shareholders. When they become in the best interest in the shareholder, we will close them. If not, we will not. We do not have pressure to close M&A because our stand-alone trajectory is already well above the peer group and our valuation is below the peer group. So we have a lot of work to continue to demonstrate to our shareholders that we deserve to align, and we will perform better than peers. If that -- when that performance finishes, which at the moment, I do not see in the next 3 to 4 years, we may have pressure on M&A. But at the moment, we have none. So we look at M&A or an inorganic investment on a very cold basis .Do they strengthen our franchise and, and I underline the and, do they increase the value we create for our shareholders, risk adjusted? Some do, some don't, and that's where we are. And as we look at our share buyback, we will look at M&A, we will look at our inorganic option. You asked me to rank. Let me see if I can make back where you ask me to rank. I think I had local distribution, new markets and factories. Okay. So if I ranked, so this is if, we clear hurdles, if we clear hurdles, okay, so assuming they all return the same or risk-adjusted means that non-risk-adjusted any M&A or investment needs to return more than buying my own stock. I would say new market, meaning M&A -- geographic M&A, call it this way, in any market where we are or the one immediately close to us, as I have mentioned, Poland, more than once. Secondly, strengthen of our factories. Thirdly, buying back our own stock. And why is that? Because if I clear the hurdles, doing this investment and M&A will elongate the period in which we can add value. We think we have an unmatched blueprint to extract value from banks and from what we do. And if we have the opportunity to do it profitably, in the interest of our shareholders, we will. But at the same time, and I want to be very clear because I keep on saying that and maybe it's not getting through. I've done M&A for a long time, and I have seen massive destruction of value by management team and companies that put pressures by media, by short-term views, by speculation, do transaction and from the next day, they need to repair the damage for several years. I will not do that, and I'm very patient and calm and the Board is completely aligned. So we find the right transaction, we will do them faster than you can believe. We don't find them, we will execute our own plan."

Although there also -- there were also perimeter changes in the last couple of quarters. So what trend are you expecting in headcount going forward? And any -- related to this on the cost base, any read across from the partnership with Google that you announced today? And secondly, on common equity Tier 1, the capital was stronger than expected this quarter.

        "speaker": "Andrea Orcel ",
        "text": "Thank you, Marco. So let me take it first and then Stefano will complete. So we do not have a focus on FTE reduction, never did, never will. We have a focus on cost efficiencies. FTE reduction leads people to move core activities outside of the perimeter of the bank, and then say we have reduced FTEs as opposed to invest in their people and internalize activities that we push outside of the bank. So a lot of our cost reduction has been done by reinternalizing activities that were pushed before. Having said that, we have had significant number of people leaving on a net basis due to what is physiological in Central and Eastern Europe and retirements of people where we pay their old pass to pension because this bank had not touched certain categories for years and had not hired young people for years. As we hired young people, we were able to replenish our pyramidal age, and therefore, exit, let's say, more expensive people that were at the end of our career and the wish to exit, and reinvesting on younger people that were at the start of a career. So if you do that and you reinternalize, maybe your headcount does not decline as much as you would think, but the cost per head and the efficiency per head goes up materially. So we don't track FTE reduction. We track cost of HR reduction vis-a-vis what their efficiency is and we tracked non-HR cost. Another thing that you should consider is that we are not here to reduce cost 1 quarter, 2 quarters, 3 quarters, 4 quarters. We have been reducing cost for -- now I have lost count, but probably more than 10 quarters. Our objective is to have a grip on cost to keep it under control, to not let them deviate and focus on efficiency. I have no problem if I can grow twice as much if I need to let go on cost, but my cost to income ratio and our efficiency is what's driving it. It is also true that as of today, we are gradually shifting our attention on non-HR cost, which are one matter that all of us should look at because inflation is having a significant impact on those. So my general answer is, look at cost, we're going to keep them broadly in line, not one quarter but for the next 3 years. And that is a massive achievement, and we have a lot of variables that we need to look at. What is read across from Google partnership? I would say, like every other partnership like the MasterCard partnership and like many others we have done with Alpha, for example, these are not providers, distributor or client provider relationship, they are partnership. So with Google, we will together transform the bank. With MasterCard, we will together transform payment. With Alpha Bank, we will together create value from them distributing our products and we manufacturing them. So we want to do more of those. It creates an ecosystem and it creates the right motivation from our partners to see us successful and for us to see them successful. On the CET1, this -- and then I'll pass to Stefano. So we -- I would look at it that way. They're about 50 basis points that are -- I don't know if you want to call them one-off or you want to call them more volatile, which is why if you see, we have created a buffer in our excess capital. About half of those come from the ruble appreciation in Russia and the other half comes from the overall performance of our strategic portfolio including hedges, and I underline including hedges because hedges are an excellent things when things go badly, but they cost money when things go up. Now Monday morning quarterbacking, today, we would all like not to have hedges. But my job is to create consistency over time. Therefore, we are hedged versus we had a positive outcome, but not as positive as it could or would have been. As you have seen, our total capital has moved from 6.5% to 10%. But specifically because we have more volatile area in our capital generation, we have limited the one we are committing to return to you to EUR 7.5 billion keeping a buffer of EUR 2.5 billion. If we consolidate those performance and those risks go away or decline, there is EUR 2.5 billion that are sitting there to be used. And that's the total, but I will pass it with Stefano."

        "speaker": "Stefano Porro ",
        "text": "Thank you, Andrea. So adding a point on the reduction of the headcounts. Marco, you're referring to a reduction of the total headcounts in terms of FTEs of 1% year-on-year to consider the change in the perimeter. So it's important to have a look at that also when you look to the future because we had the change of Alpha Romania and Aion-Vodeno, so if you would adjust for these changes, the reduction of the FTEs would be year-on-year equal to minus 4%. Clearly, as highlighted by Andrea, we're looking to the trend of the overall cost, not just for the FTE, but you can assume that in order to be able to keep costs slightly down also in the course of the following years, excluding the effect from the perimeter, we will have to reduce also the headcount component, clearly, not at this path, we will keep on optimizing and a consequence 3 that, reducing also the headcounts component in future. With regards to the capital impact in the first quarter and more specifically in relation to the line -- to the part of the capital walk called PD Scenario and Other Items. So first of all, there is fundamentally no impact from the PD scenario, it's just, let's say, around 1 basis point. So that's not material. What is material is capital reserves, around 26 basis points out of that is the ruble appreciation, okay? Then we have around 10 basis points deriving from fair value through OCI reserves, so the reserve that we have related to the mark-to-market of bond investments and pension funds, okay? So this is positive for around 10 basis points. Then there are 2 other important elements. One is tax loss carryforward and intangibles. Deposit effect is around 15 basis points. Tax loss carryforward is related to the Italian perimeter. At the beginning of the year, we had around EUR 4 billion of recognized tax loss carryforward that are deducted from the capital. We will utilize this tax loss carryforward during the course of the next years. The total benefit of the capital for the future will be 120 basis points in the next 6 years. You can expect around something more than 25 basis points during the course of '25 from this utilization. The final point is in relation to threshold deduction, which is threshold deduction. We have some deduction connected to the investment -- to the significant investment in financial sector entities. During the quarter, the capital improvements was such that this threshold deduction went down and went down for an amount of around 15 basis points, 1-5. So wrapping up, 26 basis point is FX, ruble appreciation; 10 basis point is capital reserve, bonds, pension fund; 15 basis point, tax loss carryforward and intangible point; 15 basis point is this threshold deduction that I explained to you. In relation to 2025, you have asked if there is something more to be taken into consideration? The answer is yes, is the effect deriving from model changes. We had around 6 basis points during this quarter deriving from Basel. We will have model changes for an amount around EUR 8 billion during the course of the remaining quarters of this year. For the rest, it will be capital generation through the business and also including capital efficiency actions."

        "text": "Okay. Thank you, Delphine. So capital, strategic portfolio. As we said, the impact, 25 basis points positive. Impact on trading, minus 40. Why minus 40? Because -- minus EUR 40 million sorry, minus EUR 40 million impact on trading, minus EUR 40 million. Why? Because part of a stake, the almost 10% we announced when we bought the stake from the government is not going for trading, is going through -- directly through equity. So we are hedged 100%, and the move of those hedge are 100%. So if everything goes up, the up from the part that is in our -- that goes to equity, you don't see it through trading, you see directly to capital, while the up of the -- all of the hedges -- well, the impact of all the hedges that in this case were negative, you see them in trading. So the hedges are only matching in the P&L, let's call it, rough-cut 3/4 of our underlying because 1 quarter -- sorry, 2/3 of our underlying because 1/3 goes directly to equity, and that's the asymmetry. And as we said, we had a good performance overall to capital. but we're not taking that as a performance that will stay there. It's more volatile. It depends on the market. So for the time being, we're happy we're hedged, we stay where we are. And then Stefano may add a few things on that, if there are. On BPM. So on BPM, let me recap, so we all see where we are. We made an offer in November. At the time of the offer, we were very clear that we felt there was uncertainty around Anima, and therefore, we were not going to pay for that uncertainty. And we would -- we were doing -- we were offering a 15% -- 20% when you include dividend, premium to shareholders and on undisturb on Anima. After that time, we obviously realize that given the timing of the offer of BPM, we would not be able to do the share buyback of EUR 3.6 billion until after closing BPM or not doing BPM. But if we do BPM, the shareholders of BPM get their share in the share buyback of UniCredit 2024. That's another 6%. Then after that, we realized that in order to align the asset quality of BPM to ours in Italy, we need to do another EUR 800 million of provisions, EUR 550 million after tax. That's another 6%. And then we got Anima, which we were very right to ignore because Anima, depending on what you want to evaluate, destroyed value between EUR 1 billion and EUR 1.7 billion in the bank. Indeed, if you look at their capital projection, now with Anima in, the share buyback is gone, and they need to climb back to a decent level of capital. Capital, excess capital that we were paying for in November and now was deployed at an 11% return, which if I did with my own share buybacks or with my own investment, I would derate. So if you put them all together and you can do the math, you find easily between a 40% to 50% premium to where they were before we made the offer. If you look at it in another way, you find that we are trading at more or less the same multiple, but if you adjust for the lower CET1 for the lower coverage of the loan book and for our excess capital, and EUR 3 billion of P&L buffer, but they do not have, you find that they're trading at more than 30% to 35% PE gap to us, which brings you back to a similar number. So we start from a situation where we have the right to evaluate the situation, to analyze what is happening because I would add another thing: when you buy a factory and that factory distributes through other banks, other banks' appetite to distribute the product of that factory usually goes down, not up. And therefore, we need to look at that. And we have time, we have a right to have time. So we were evaluating that situation until we got golden power. We got golden power, although its content are supposed to be secret. I understand they are widely public in the press. So you can make your own opinion on that. There are a number of elements in the Golden Power that are, in our opinion, not clear and not intended. We're trying to clarify them. We need to go through that before we take a definitive decision. So we will get either clarification or not. If it's not, we will need to make our own interpretation of what the golden power indicates. When we get all that, we will make a decision. But for the time being, we have no pressure. We have patience like on everything else, and we will wait."

So the effects are some of them in P&L, top line, mainly in the trading, some of them through equity and some of them in risk-weighted assets. So the sum up of all this effect in the quarter brought to a positive capital contribution of around plus 25 basis points of Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. The overall risk-weighted asset consumption of this investment is something more than EUR 2 billion for, let's say, an overall capital absorption between 10 and 15 basis points."

And then secondly, on the more than EUR 400 million benefits expected in net profit 2027, I think it's Slide 21 of the presentation, can you give a little bit of color as to how that would split across revenues and costs? And then also on the life insurance JVs, it says the merger is expected by 2026 completion by end of 2025, do you expect there to be any consolidation benefits in 2025 or will this now be 2026?"

        "text": "Yes. So in relation to the net interest income trends. So net interest income trend of Austria has been impacted from one, an overall trend of customer rate on the asset side and trend on the deposit rate on the deposit side. In relation to the customer rate on the deposit side, do consider that there was a reduction of the pass-through, but the reduction of the pass-through will take further because, especially in Germany and Austria, it takes time in order to reprice down because we do have also term deposits. . So all in all, the expectation is that the net interest income trend should improve during the course of 2025. The more we are able to reprice down on the deposit through the reduction of the rate on term deposit and we get more traction in terms of lending trend. Having said that, in relation to the lending trend dynamic, while we are expecting an increase of the lending trend for the group in terms of stock, something more than 1% of increase of the stock of loans during the course of this year, such an improvement will come mainly from Central Eastern Europe. We will have a slight improvement around 1% year-on-year from Italy and Austria and slightly down in Germany. So the trend of Austria in terms of net interest income will be better during the course of final part of the year and especially during the course of 2026. In relation to the replicating portfolio, the replicating portfolio has been increased during the course of this quarter. So if we look at the end of the quarter in comparison with the end of the year is up EUR 7 billion. The average is slightly below EUR 180 billion and for an average duration of around 5. The yield is around 1.2%. The contribution in the next 3 years, simply deriving from the rolling of the replicating portfolio, so between '27 if you look in comparing with net interest income from replicating of '24 is around EUR 500 million. That's backloaded, so it's not front loaded with the majority of the contribution in '26 and especially in '27. With regard to the consolidation. So in relation to the consolidation, we have mentioned the effect deriving from Alpha and Aion-Vodeno. So if you look in relation -- in terms of change of perimeter, so that is not a meaningful impact from a consolidation standpoint. The majority of the synergies in relation to Alpha Romania will come second part of this year and next year. The cost base of Alpha Romania is around EUR 100 million. So if you need to take this into consideration, do consider EUR 100 million with the synergies that will kick in second part of the year and especially last year. So the cost base that we'll have from Alpha Romania next year will be lower than a base for a year that you can consider equal to EUR 100 million. In relation to the -- I mean, you mentioned the EUR 400 million, right, so in 2027, deriving from the different perimeter, i.e., from the insurance around EUR 100 million; from Alpha Romania around EUR 100 million; and from Aion-Vodeno that is more than EUR 200 million. So in relation to this, I believe that it's important for you to take into consideration the effect that are very, very much differentiated. So if you consider the current cost base for this year, the current cost base for this year deriving from the sum up of this perimeter will be around EUR 250 million for a revenue base that will be around EUR 400 million. This will be progressively going up with synergies already in '25 and '26 from insurance and from Alpha while the progression will be more backloaded if you want from Aion-Vodeno standpoint in the sense that you can expect a contribution equal fundamentally to the bottom line of 0 this year, progressively going up, but with definitely a higher amount in 2027."

With that in mind, how are you thinking about excess capital and your commitment to address it by 2027? Will you begin distributing some of the excess every year from now on? Or maybe is the target for 12.5%, 13% CET1 ratio further pushed beyond 2027? And the second one is a follow-on -- so follow-up, sorry, on your comments around NII before. You flagged that you had a lower pass-through this quarter versus Q4 2024. Did you already anticipate this positive trend on your NII guidance of moderate decline year-on-year? Or is there upside to your expectations if pass-through indeed continues falling?"

        "text": "Okay. So on excess capital, our commitment remains the same. So we will return our excess capital above 13% CET1 by the end of 2027, that does not change. What I said on M&A is no pressure just to compare it to the widespread belief that if one launch an offer or buys a stake, one needs to buy at any cost and at any condition of the transaction. We are not bound to do that. If we can, and I responded to, I think, Andrea Filtri's first question. If we have the conditions that are right, we will do M&A above and beyond share buybacks, just because from a return standpoint, it makes sense. But if from a return standpoint, it doesn't make sense for our shareholders, we will not. So in order to answer your question, I think the excess capital above 13% where we keep an appropriate buffer that buffer may reduce if some of the volatile elements, either eliminate or addressed and therefore, the capital may go up from that level, we will return it by '27 or profitably employed by '27, profitably employed, it means making inorganic investment or acquisition that clear the hurdle of our share buyback and all the other metrics that we have given again and again and again. So the probability that it goes in M&A as opposed to share buyback depends on the possibility to do transactions that clear our hurdles and add more value to our shareholders than buying our stock back. It's completely linked to that, and we will be either very fast in doing them or not doing them, depending if we get that or not. On the second, I'll pass to Stefano."

So in relation to net interest income, so some ingredients, which are our assumption rates wise, so we're expecting to have a deposit facility rate of ECB at -- so below 2% at 175 by the summer, meaning that the exit Euribor will be below 2% clearly by year-end. So we are currently assuming 1.8%. Overall, average Euribor for the year at 2.1%, which is the net interest income sensitivity, so plus/minus 50 basis point Euribor is plus/minus EUR 300 million. The deposit pass-through sensitivity is 1 percentage point is EUR 100 million, which are our assumption in terms of the deposit pass-through. We closed the deposit pass-through for the group, excluding Russia, is around 33%, 3-3, and we were at 34% same perimeter at the end of Q4. We are currently assuming to be slightly better. So we are currently assuming to be at around 32%. So with this assumption, we are expecting to have a moderate reduction of the net interest income as guided for high single digit. So it's something more than the mid-single digit. Clearly, if they pass through, reduction will be better than what we are assuming, as I told you before, a relation to Austria and Germany, we are currently assuming a reduction of the pass-through in Austria and Germany, for every percentage point net interest income can be better on an annual basis for around EUR 100 million.
