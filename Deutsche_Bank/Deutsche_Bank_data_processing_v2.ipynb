Hi, Christian, James, Thanks for taking my         questions. First question is regarding the comment around FIC slowdown. Can you just put that in context? In April, you mentioned that, I think, on Bloomberg and Christian, you just mentioned that as well. Could you just put it in context of what timeframe you're comparing? And secondly, in that context, just tell me what subsegments of FIC are weaker than credit. Is it 18 rates? Maybe even by geography, if possible, just so we get an idea. And if this is just an immediate reaction of what happened in the markets, post tariffs, or is this an ongoing issue that we should think about in our modelling. And then the second question is regarding your outlook, GDP, US assumption 1.7, China, four and a half. Just wondering if these numbers, what would happen if they would be significantly lower? Because they look a bit on the higher end of what market consensus expectation or forward curves are assuming. If you could discuss that relative to your 10% RoTE plus target and issues around that, if we should think about if it could have a negative impact, so to say. James von Moltke   Sure. Thanks. And I'll start on the guidance that we'd given or commentary about the market. Look, I think one important thing is to say is that the second half of April, and it isn't precisely in halves, but I think the easiest way to think about it is second half of April, resumed a pattern that looked very much like what you see in the disclosure on daily trading results in the FIC business for much of the first quarter. So, to your question about ongoing, it isn't a concern for us at the moment at all. In fact, I think we're well positioned to recapture the foregone revenues from the first half of April as in the balance of the quarter. In fairness, we're actually up year on year still in April. So we look at this with a relaxed view. Naturally, in markets that are as turbulent as the ones we experienced in the first couple of weeks of April, you're going to see some correlations breakdown, some impact on the books. But we were reasonably happy. So there was, of course, a slowdown a few weak days, but we were happy with how the desks performed in that environment. The way we were able to stand in, to provide liquidity for clients, pricing, what have you. In terms of the products, it was a little varied around the world. But to your point, credit struggled more, and there were elements in the Rates and FX complexes 19 where, again, correlations moving created some disturbance. What's interesting is how quickly and almost fully the markets have recovered over the course of April. Again, going to your question about, is it an ongoing concern? As we sit here today, really, it's not. And actually, I've been positively impressed by the way in which investors have continued to be engaged in the environment that we have, which is reasonably fast moving. In terms of the outlook, lots of our assumptions are driven by macroeconomic variables. And I'll focus on revenues and expenses. And naturally, we look at downside scenarios. And that was the principal driver, of course, of the overlay that we took in provisions in Q1. We think that overlay was prudent and appropriate and actually reflects how the macroeconomic consensus has moved since the end of March. So we feel quite comfortable with how, if you like, first quarter reporting reflects our outlook, as well as the consensus environment today. The other thing, just more broadly to the question you asked and really Christian\\u2019s response to Chris's question. We see a lot of what I'll call portfolio effects in our businesses. So businesses that are maybe negatively affected by certain elements of the macro environment will be offset by others that are benefited. And so it isn't at all linear. And we feel like the balance of risks and opportunities that we see in the market really underscores our outlook, as Christian just mentioned.

We have already made progress in all of these\\n- Turning first to operational efficiencies:\\n- We raised our ambition for incremental efficiencies from 2 billion euros to 2.5 billion euros, as we said\\n- We have already delivered more than 600 million euros, through a range of measures such as branch closures in the Private Bank, standardizing loan processing in the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank and simplifying our technology infrastructure\\n- We anticipate 300 million euros of savings by 2025 from the successfully completed migration of 12 million Postbank clients onto the Deutsche Bank technology platform\\n- And we  expect more than 100 million euros from the announced redundancies in senior non-client facing roles as more than 80% of affected staff have either been informed or left the platform\\n- In other words, a total of around 1 billion euros in savings are either already achieved, or are expected from measures now implemented\\n- We have a series of other measures in flight- for example, streamlining our mortgage business and further branch closures in the Private Bank; re-engineering more front-to-back processes in the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank; further application de-commissioning; and additional workforce measures\\n- These are some examples of a wider programme of initiatives underway. Based on our progress on these, and realized achievements so far, we reaffirm our 2.5-billion-euro goal\\n- In respect of capital efficiencies: as you know, our aim is to reduce risk weighted assets by 15-20 billion euros by 2025 relative to our baseline assumptions with a modest revenue impact\\n- In the second quarter we accelerated securitisation transactions which delivered RWA relief of around 3 billion euros\\n- In addition, credit risk RWAs were reduced as part of the Trade Finance and Lending optimization efforts\\n- Overall, we proved our revenue strength with the business delivering revenue growth while our FX adjusted RWAs decreased by 5 billion euros compared to the prior year quarter\\n- We have further optimization measures in preparation for the second half of 2023 including securitisation of consumer finance loans and reductions in sub-hurdle lending\\n- All this gives us confidence that we will deliver on our capital optimisation goals\\n- Turning finally to revenue growth: we are fully on track to outperform on our revenue growth targets, of 3.5 to 4.5% compound annual growth against 2021 levels\\n- On a last-twelve-month basis, we delivered compound annual revenue growth versus 2021 of 7.5%, well ahead of that target, with revenue growth of 8% in the first half of this year\\n- We expect the interest rate environment to continue to drive sustainable performance in our stable businesses\\n- We  anticipate added momentum from our organic and inorganic investments, including the Numis acquisition or the new partnership with Lufthansa and Miles & More, and from hiring of some 50 senior O&A bankers. This enables us to take advantage of an expected pickup in corporate finance activity \\u2013 we are already seeing signs of this in our backlog. We have also hired around 30 wealth managers\\n- And we expect the growth in our assets under management, and net asset inflows, to drive fee income in future quarters\\n- To sum up:\\n- We are delivering revenue and business growth off a strong franchise; our well-balanced, complementary business mix enables us to drive continued revenue momentum; we are increasing our earnings power year by year, and we see a clear path to achieving our 2025 profitability targets, amongst others an RoTE of larger than 10% in 2025\\n- And we are delivering on two key promises: distributing 8 billion euros to shareholders, and accelerating execution of our Global Hausbank strategy\\n- With that: let me hand over to James JAMES VON MOLTKE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

Hi, Christian, James, Thanks for taking my         questions. First question is regarding the comment around FIC slowdown. Can you just put that in context? In April, you mentioned that, I think, on Bloomberg and Christian, you just mentioned that as well. Could you just put it in context of what timeframe you're comparing? And secondly, in that context, just tell me what subsegments of FIC are weaker than credit. Is it 18 rates? Maybe even by geography, if possible, just so we get an idea. And if this is just an immediate reaction of what happened in the markets, post tariffs, or is this an ongoing issue that we should think about in our modelling. And then the second question is regarding your outlook, GDP, US assumption 1.7, China, four and a half. Just wondering if these numbers, what would happen if they would be significantly lower? Because they look a bit on the higher end of what market consensus expectation or forward curves are assuming. If you could discuss that relative to your 10% RoTE plus target and issues around that, if we should think about if it could have a negative impact, so to say. James von Moltke   Sure. Thanks. And I'll start on the guidance that we'd given or commentary about the market. Look, I think one important thing is to say is that the second half of April, and it isn't precisely in halves, but I think the easiest way to think about it is second half of April, resumed a pattern that looked very much like what you see in the disclosure on daily trading results in the FIC business for much of the first quarter. So, to your question about ongoing, it isn't a concern for us at the moment at all. In fact, I think we're well positioned to recapture the foregone revenues from the first half of April as in the balance of the quarter. In fairness, we're actually up year on year still in April. So we look at this with a relaxed view. Naturally, in markets that are as turbulent as the ones we experienced in the first couple of weeks of April, you're going to see some correlations breakdown, some impact on the books. But we were reasonably happy. So there was, of course, a slowdown a few weak days, but we were happy with how the desks performed in that environment. The way we were able to stand in, to provide liquidity for clients, pricing, what have you. In terms of the products, it was a little varied around the world. But to your point, credit struggled more, and there were elements in the Rates and FX complexes 19 where, again, correlations moving created some disturbance. What's interesting is how quickly and almost fully the markets have recovered over the course of April. Again, going to your question about, is it an ongoing concern? As we sit here today, really, it's not. And actually, I've been positively impressed by the way in which investors have continued to be engaged in the environment that we have, which is reasonably fast moving. In terms of the outlook, lots of our assumptions are driven by macroeconomic variables. And I'll focus on revenues and expenses. And naturally, we look at downside scenarios. And that was the principal driver, of course, of the overlay that we took in provisions in Q1. We think that overlay was prudent and appropriate and actually reflects how the macroeconomic consensus has moved since the end of March. So we feel quite comfortable with how, if you like, first quarter reporting reflects our outlook, as well as the consensus environment today. The other thing, just more broadly to the question you asked and really Christian\\u2019s response to Chris's question. We see a lot of what I'll call portfolio effects in our businesses. So businesses that are maybe negatively affected by certain elements of the macro environment will be offset by others that are benefited. And so it isn't at all linear. And we feel like the balance of risks and opportunities that we see in the market really underscores our outlook, as Christian just mentioned. And hence, we're feeling pretty good about the overall macro environment, even as it's changed since the beginning of the year when we last spoke.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

We have already made progress in all of these\\n- Turning first to operational efficiencies:\\n- We raised our ambition for incremental efficiencies from 2 billion euros to 2.5 billion euros, as we said\\n- We have already delivered more than 600 million euros, through a range of measures such as branch closures in the Private Bank, standardizing loan processing in the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank and simplifying our technology infrastructure\\n- We anticipate 300 million euros of savings by 2025 from the successfully completed migration of 12 million Postbank clients onto the Deutsche Bank technology platform\\n- And we  expect more than 100 million euros from the announced redundancies in senior non-client facing roles as more than 80% of affected staff have either been informed or left the platform\\n- In other words, a total of around 1 billion euros in savings are either already achieved, or are expected from measures now implemented\\n- We have a series of other measures in flight- for example, streamlining our mortgage business and further branch closures in the Private Bank; re-engineering more front-to-back processes in the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank; further application de-commissioning; and additional workforce measures\\n- These are some examples of a wider programme of initiatives underway. Based on our progress on these, and realized achievements so far, we reaffirm our 2.5-billion-euro goal\\n- In respect of capital efficiencies: as you know, our aim is to reduce risk weighted assets by 15-20 billion euros by 2025 relative to our baseline assumptions with a modest revenue impact\\n- In the second quarter we accelerated securitisation transactions which delivered RWA relief of around 3 billion euros\\n- In addition, credit risk RWAs were reduced as part of the Trade Finance and Lending optimization efforts\\n- Overall, we proved our revenue strength with the business delivering revenue growth while our FX adjusted RWAs decreased by 5 billion euros compared to the prior year quarter\\n- We have further optimization measures in preparation for the second half of 2023 including securitisation of consumer finance loans and reductions in sub-hurdle lending\\n- All this gives us confidence that we will deliver on our capital optimisation goals\\n- Turning finally to revenue growth: we are fully on track to outperform on our revenue growth targets, of 3.5 to 4.5% compound annual growth against 2021 levels\\n- On a last-twelve-month basis, we delivered compound annual revenue growth versus 2021 of 7.5%, well ahead of that target, with revenue growth of 8% in the first half of this year\\n- We expect the interest rate environment to continue to drive sustainable performance in our stable businesses\\n- We  anticipate added momentum from our organic and inorganic investments, including the Numis acquisition or the new partnership with Lufthansa and Miles & More, and from hiring of some 50 senior O&A bankers. This enables us to take advantage of an expected pickup in corporate finance activity \\u2013 we are already seeing signs of this in our backlog. We have also hired around 30 wealth managers\\n- And we expect the growth in our assets under management, and net asset inflows, to drive fee income in future quarters\\n- To sum up:\\n- We are delivering revenue and business growth off a strong franchise; our well-balanced, complementary business mix enables us to drive continued revenue momentum; we are increasing our earnings power year by year, and we see a clear path to achieving our 2025 profitability targets, amongst others an RoTE of larger than 10% in 2025\\n- And we are delivering on two key promises: distributing 8 billion euros to shareholders, and accelerating execution of our Global Hausbank strategy\\n- With that: let me hand over to James JAMES VON MOLTKE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
